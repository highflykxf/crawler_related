1,Stay far far away from these cars!!!!,Ryheem T. ,07/20/2016,1,3,5,,,1,2,4,3,,,"My wife purchased a 2009 VW CC last year......July 2015.  The first day of owning the car the fuel pump went , luckily we purchased the car in CT where the dealers have to give you a 90 day warranty. Car was in the shop for 2 weeks total bill cam e to well over $1000.....luckily we didn't have to pay for it. Car drove good for a few months then the brake booster went(Feb 2016)...........$700 fix. My wife was recently at work and the car wouldn't start.........replaced the coil packs($500 job) , car was out of the shop no more then a few weeks...........check engine light pops up......dreaded P2015 code(intake manifold issue). Luckily VW has a warranty for this........covered for 10 yrs/120k.......fixed free of charge. Got the car back yesterday 07/16/16 , this morning car wont start. I'm telling you guys.......stay far far away from these cars........nothing but headaches!",,

Wear on the rear tires has been a problem on these cars. One the original tires was worn on the inside edge (into the cord) at 37,000. The other three all had even wear and 50% of the tread left. The alignment was checked several times and found to be correct. Dealer said this is because of the performance alignment(I don't buy it as only one tire (right rear) wore out. There is lots of talk on the internet about damage to rear suspension during tie down on the delivery trucks. Rotation helps mask the problem, but 75% of the tread wear on the car takes place on the right rear. 12 year rust through warranty. Great mileage (you can get 35 highway easily and 40 if you go 55).",,

Have owned this car for 4yrs now. Bought it with 20,000 miles. First year car ran like a champ no issues what so ever. Then came second year ofownership and everything went down hill after the warranty expired three months before. Water pump failure, $1,500 fix. Six months later water pump failedagain. I though the mechanics were idiots and did not know what they were doing until it failed again a year later. Anyhow, I've had four water pumps replaced in three years. Intake manifold failed twice, PCV valve failure and of course fuel pump failure which are all ""common"" problems due to poor engineering according to dealer. Constant oil leak until I had to have valve cover gasket redone. Oh yes, rear main seal failed at  40,000. The car has 50,675 miles at the time of this review. Great car when it runs but I have spent more money on repairs for this car than the maintenance work done on my two previous vehicles combined.",,

5,After 6 Years of Driving,Chris ,02/27/2016,5,4,5,,,4,5,5,4,,,"I came here to look up the trade in cost for this great car as I need to trade in for an SUV now that I have a bigger family. I was a bit shocked to see that some people were not happy with this car and I felt compelled to write my own review to give this car justice after 6 great years of driving it:1. Fuel Injection issue in other reviews: I did have the fuel injection issue once, took the car to the dealership and asked the mechanic on what causes it. the answer was simple: you need to use premium gas instead of regular. I never had the fuel injection issue since. 2. Reliability: I never had any mechanical issues with this car outside of the fuel injection issue I had once due to using the wrong kind of gas (I have 79k miles as of the time of writing this review). 3. Ride Quality: This is an amazing car that drives much better than the BMW 3 series and Lexus IS (tested both when I was in the market for this one). It still drives like new after putting almost 80k miles on it. 5. My only issue with this car is the trade in value. After looking up how much this car has depreciated, I think I am going to keep it for another 2 - 3 years to maximize my money's worth out of this amazing car.",,

Yes, it has been a luxury you can't afford to own. VW should be ashamed for putting together such an unreliable vehicle. We bought it new in 2009. Now it has 70K miles. I also have a $7K dent in my wallet for repairs. Water pump failed. It takes half a day to have it replaced.

We just want everyone to do their homework first.","Guess all this is fine if you want a car more for looks then practicality, but many small improvements would help (maybe done in newer models). AC vents should be set so people can cool off and not just to cool the cabin. Windows constantly going up and down is annoying and just seems prone to wear the window motors out quick.

There's something exceptionally solid about German engineering that you just don't find in most other makes.  My only mistake may have been installing splash guards.

What I originally wanted was a VR6 Sport with black or silver exterior w/ navigation.  The vehicle that fit my description was not available at my local dealer but they did have a VR6 4-Motion in Iron Gray ext w/navi (64mi on the ODM) with huge discount on the price as they were already getting in MY10s.  So I took it.  It took me a while to get used to the ext color but I instantly fell in love with the car when winter came with heavy snow.  The 4-motion makes driving in Michigan snow weather so easy when I compare it to my previous MY2000 BMW 323i. No slips or ESC/TCS lights blinking...just WONDERFUL!,"Exterior/interior design, 4-motion","Bi-xenon headlight option and 4-motion with the 4cyl variant.

Once you sit in this thing everything else feels cheap and gimmicky. In terms of performance, I love driving this car. It's brawny when you want it to be, but it can double as a comfortable commuter.

So I found this car that had all the features I wanted, for a great price and quality of German Engineering.  I love how the seats hug my body while driving.  The other nice feature is the back seat pass-though in the center.  This feature allows 4 people and skis to comfortably fit in the car.  The 60/40 split seats are also nice when transporting other larger items.  My friend bought his Jetta TDI from this same place after enjoying the ride in my car.

Hard choice picking the VW over the ""luxury"" brands, but I have to tell you that it was definitely worth the name plate trade off. Extremely well built, solid car; very fun to drive, with a lot of pep for a 4-cylinder; like others have noted, unlike the entry level luxs, you will get plenty of looks. So many people have stopped my wife and me and asked what type of car it was, or just complimented the style and look. We bought a luxury model fully loaded (backup camera, bluetooth, nav, etc.) in the blue/gray. Would recommend to anyone. ","Solidly built. Great style inside and out. Nav system is great, and easy to use. Get the backup camera, as the rear sight lines are not the best, plus it has a great backup guidance system. Good sound system with 30gb HD and media inputs. Lot of power out of the 4-cylinder turbo. Great gas mileage. ","Tilting moon roof is great, but a sliding sunroof would be better (but I understand why).

It really stands out on the road in a sea of forgetable family sedans.  The get up and go has really surprised me; you find yourself over the posted speed limit in no time and the power delivery is so smooth, you would never know this is a 4 banger.

Audi, BMW, and currently a Mercedes E350 (our other vehicle).  From an engineering and design standpoint, the CC is a home run for VW and the best value in the industry.  Remarkable acceleration from the 2.0L turbo 4, great handling, beautiful design inside & out. If they could have made the sunroof retractable, this car would be near perfect.","Design, handling & acceleration, seats (great support), steering wheel, lighting, stereo system, ultrasonic parking assist warnings.","Sliding sunroof.

Its unique, you do not see yourself coming and going.  Only negative is the roof line, i.e.,rear seat passengers need to be reminded of roof line so they do not hit their head getting in and out of car, front seat needs to be as low as possible to make it easier for anyone over 5"" 8"" to get in and out as well. Once in, very, very comfortable all around.  Only other real negative for me is that phone book does not download to bluetooth system.  Overall, this is unlike any VW I have ever been in (Other then perhaps the Phaeton).

Although steering gives less feedback, as others have said, it corners precisely and enthusiastically while the wide, low tires grip tenaciously. Slaloming at high speed on twists and around corners at night, watching pivoting headlights track is a sublimely James Bond movie experience. No defects after 3-plus weeks.

I currently have about 800 miles on it, and it has been a blast to drive!  It has excellent pickup, gas mileage and comfort. I feel like I bought a high end luxury car! Test drive it!!!","I love the high quality interior and the luxury feeling with its standard features.  The interior is super quiet, and its gets better gas mileage than my 05 Mini Cooper S!  I got almost 400 miles in 70/30 highway/city driving!  It has excellent pick-up and go.  Test drive it...you'll like it!!","One little nit-pick is that the radio LCD screen lights up blue at night, which doesn't match the white numbering of the speedometer area (which is very Audi-like).   Also, the 'beep' feature when activating the alarm/locking the doors sounds cheap and Honda-like with a garish high-pitched 'honk.'"

The price point is amazing, the features are above those offered in the same class level at the price.  I have only had it 2 days, but can't wait to get in and drive.  Have been waved down 3 times in the 30 hours I have owned it to ask what it is.  Love that it has no real markings, other than the VW logo.  People think its a Benz.","Engine and acceleration, fuel economy, dealership was great to work with, creature comfort features that are overpriced on other models like Honda and Toyota (heated seats, trip computer).

Drove a new CC and found it rode better, was quieter, and of course looks great. Gone is the ""wallow"" in higher speed corners that was present in my old Passat.  CC has a tighter feel all around.

It looks and feels like a much more expensive car and the 2 tone leatherette interior is top notch. The clutch is very light and the 6 speed manual is satisfying.  This is a great car!

The CC was a few thousand less than the Audi, but the cars are actually quite similar. The CC LUX edition has beautiful leather seats, and all the conveniences of an entry level luxury car. Although Bluetooth is optional and runs about $300 dealer installed. The car drives like an A4 with ample power from the 2.0T engine. Handling is superb. This is my 3rd VW in the past 8 years. Also owned and A4 for awhile. This is probably the nicest, most well appointed, and best handling out of all 4 cars. You can get an entry level CC for around $25K+ which is quite a bargain as well. ","Real leather seats, touch screen navigation, enormous trunk, incredible exterior styling, fun to drive, great performance. "," It would be nice to have a footwell light as advertised.  The sunroof should slide back instead of just pop up.  Also, the MDI adapter that comes with the car does not work with the iPod.

I've only seen one other on the road. The quality and reliability (thus far) are vastly superior to my former Passat. Standard features compare very favorably to baseline Hondas, Toyotas, Minis, other German autos, etc.  Heated seats are wonderful on cold mornings. The two tone interior gets envious stares!

Faced with the choice of BMW, Mercedes or Infiniti -- I am thrilled to report that two months with this car has been great.

The standard features of Auto headlights with coming home and leaving home, rain sensing wipers, self dimming rear view mirrors, bag hook in trunk, and a 6 cd changer on the CC may only be had in an A4 with a $4000 package!  The styling is very unique and very seductive and intriguing.  The interior is very luxurious and very well thought out.  Everything lies in an intuitive spot.  The steering feel is better than the 09 A4, and the handling is tighter as well as more compliant.",The Autohold and the electronic parking brake is all automatic.  I don't have to press the parking button at all to start driving. Sweet! The seats are cushy and supportive.

4.75,Love the car - but prefer stick shift,joey ,02/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Having recently moved from Germany, this is my first car in the US. And while I really love the CC -- kudos for the other reviewers who I concur with on all the pros and favorites -- I had to make a hard compromise:  In Germany, all VWs have manual transmission by default, automatic being an option. Here, stick shift isn't even an option (except in the Sport trim, which doesn't allow the selection of sunroof, dynaudio or navi options). Yes, we're in the US but I would like to give VW a gentle nudge about heritage! As soon as VW fixes this, I'll replace my current CC!  Side note: Why is a headliner called headliner? Maybe because your head touches it if you exceed 6 feet on the back seat :-)","I may never understand what the developers were thinking when they designed this car. Maybe they read my mind? I have no other explanation for why I feel that passionate and irrational about every aspect of the CC. When I drive the car, I am one with it. And that feeling is my favorite feature.","Find a way to improve headspace on the back seats without losing the sexy curves.  And for the sake of being a German car brand: please fix the configuration option politics. After all, choice of transmission is a very, very personal preference."

The 2 litre engine is plenty powerful, and there is no need for more. Manumatic transmission is fun and quick. The handling is tight and responsive, and it is remarkably quiet on the highway. I am coming from 12 years of Acura RLs. The seats are extremely comfortable and supportive, the back seats are big enough for my two teenage girls. Biggest downside, so far, is that there are large blind spots over the left and right shoulders. Rear seat headrests get in the way of my wife's view out the back. Mileage, so far, has been 27 highway (averaging 80 mph) and 20 around town. Not yet broken in, though.","Supportive seats, nice and quiet on the road, tight handling. I love how people tell me what a great looking car it is! ","The audio system has its own hard drive, but will only accept mp3 audio files - it needs to accept mp4a !

I have never gotten more ""thumbs up"" and favorable parking lot comments. The build quality is first-rate. The turbocharged four delivers great performance with truly amazing fuel economy. The value for the money is absolutely out of this world -- nobody sells more car than this for the $27,000 I paid. The dealer experience could not be better. But I am being driven to distraction by the artificial, electronic power steering, which alternates between totally numb and far too much resistance. ","Beautiful styling.  Fantastic fuel economy. 34 mpg by the trip computer, nearly 600-mile range.  Elastic powertrain, plenty of passing and merging power immediately available.  Very firm yet comfortable seats.  Excellent and highly adjustable driving position.  Plenty of room for four plus luggage.","The electronic power steering has no on-center feel and wanders slightly but noticeably.

So feeling is almost like 360hp G35.","Sport driving style, handling and stability, high speed handling, available power, Luxury interior even for basic model, front seats (very comfortable), price for V4 models",Back seats (only 2) - prefer to have regular (3 persons) back seats instead of console. For the price even basic model may have a bit more fancy features such built-in BT and parking aid.

5,NEVER LOOKING BACK,BRANDON ,11/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am so glad I took the time to compare. I've been an Infinity owner for the past 6 years but decided to test drive the VW CC bfore my next purchase; and ""Thank God"" I did. I've only had my new CC for 2 months but I feel like it's a test drive each morning just going to work. I love my VW and the solid feel it gives me. I just feel safer and sportier in it.","I love the 4-motion. I live near the mountains and this car gives me the ability to drive on snow, water, or ice.","I wish the sunroof was fully retractable, although it does get hot where I live so I doubt I would use it much."

5,VW finally got it right...,bronzkitty ,11/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Lease was up on my 2006 VW Passat; been waiting for the CC but test drove everything under the sun in the meantime. The CC is everything I'd hoped it would be: exterior build and interior fit are exemplary. The car is fast and for the most part rides smooth (the run-flat tires make the ride a tad rougher). The navigation and satellite radio are a definite upgrade from my 06 Passat's navi. My mom and I were sitting in the car last night watching Indiana Jones on DVD; the sound was amazing and I don't even have Dynaudio. VW got this one right.,"Navi, 30 gb hard drive, ipod adapter, park assist, feel of the seats, panorama roof. The carefree maintenance package available on all 2009s, is on par with BMW and Volvo's complimentary maintenance.","I've had the car for a week, no suggestions for improvement at this time."

5,CC=Completely Cool!,Debbie ,11/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've been a VW driver for many years and when the CC came along it was love at first sight. I bought the Sport/MT  which is the base trim level. I can't believe all the standard features that it comes with, all for under $28,000. All my friends are green with envy.",The Sport seats are incredible! They just snuggle you in and provide you with great support. ,"I don't know how the CC can be improved, it's perfection!"

5,The CC is that and more...,Kimyatta ,11/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Passat 06 up for lease; just bought the CC last night (11.12.8). While waiting for the CC to come out, I test drove everything under the sun (AccordCamAltSaturnBMWMerc)for the past year, and I still came back to the CC. It's fun to drive, and is easily the most stylish of all the Passats.  Excellent interior fit and finish. Like one of the other reviewers stated, it's not for everyone but if you're looking for something different from the standard Passat or some of the other sedans out there, it's a great value. And yes, it does resemble the Mercedes CLS. There I've said it. Just bought it, so I'll check back with another review when I've had it for awhile.","Technology package, park assist, memory seats, touch navi, panorama sunroof. Carefree maintenance: it's about time!",None at this time.

4.75,A better Passat,2PassatOwner ,11/02/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"As a 2 Passat owner, I would say this is definitely one of the best Passat VW ever build. It's not for everyone but a irresistible one for people who appreciate German engineer at a reasonable price. I can't help with a smile on my face every time driving it.","Solid feel, nimble handling, high speed stability and fun to drive.","DSG transmission, diesel engine"

5,Love my new VW CC,Lena ,10/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"It's a great looking car, fun to drive and makes you feel really good on the road! Everything about it is perfect, has all I wanted.  ","Navigation system is great, the seats are very comfortable, love the interior design! ",Wish the sun roof was retractable.

5,retired my old passat,andy ,10/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought the CC after unsuccessful attempts to find Jetta TDI wagon. distinctly different from my 03 passat,the CC looks great. the ride is typical VW firm,the interior is 9/10s Audi.seating is much better d/t power adjustments.I've always driven Man. trans-so I thought I'd do so again. After 2 test drives, I felt auto seems more appropriate. The vinyl (leatherette) feels fine but is probably not as durable as real leather. All in all a very sleek, comfortable long- distance cruiser. ","Seats are great,headlights much improved over previous passat's projector beams.Overall beauty.","I've only owned for 1 week, 1000 miles but air vents seem small with very little cabin air movement unless fan is on a little (low). for as small charge offer Leather as standard."

5,Love It!,NetGuy411 ,10/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I got this car on Saturday. It is a pleasure to drive. I love having a manual transmission again. The engine is very responsive. I got 29 MPG on my first tank of gas. Why would any buy the six cylinder?,The engine. The Transmission. The stereo. Shadow Blue color.,"Make Sunroof and Automatic Air available on the Sport model. Make the manual transmission available across all trim lines, like it is in Germany."
