4.375,Best car I've ever owned or driven.,driverlife ,05/07/2013,,,5,5,4,4,,5,3,4,5,"Very much improved over older RX-8s I have never owned a car that is this much fun to drive. The cars turn in ability and grip is extreme. Sometimes its hard to live with because the suspension is so stiff. But its been my daily driver and weekend warrior for more than 3 years now. I always get looks in this car. The interior is really upscale with piano black center pieces. and aluminum inserts.It's much faster than the other cars I've owned: 98 Oldsmobile Aurora V8, 03 Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V. I also currently own a 2006 civic si that is also sporty and more forgiving on the back. Its not as fast as the RX-8 and no where near the RX-8 in handling prowess. ",1.3L rotary engine has a smooth high rpm redline (9000 rpm) and are hand built. There are interior accent lights on the doors that shine down on the buttons. Hids. Gunmetal 19' wheels. Stock body kit and bilstein shocks give it an incredible stance. Seats are stiff but comfortable due to there premium materials.,It uses a lot of fuel. Its rated at 16city/22highway. I usually average 15mpg with mixed driving. In future RX models they need to improve the power and fuel economy.

3.25,Oiled Out!,Disgusted In FL ,10/28/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,3,2,1,4,"My experience owning this vehicle has its ups and downs.  On the down side, the car burns too much oil.  After an oil change, the oil light comes on 1000 miles into the oil change.  I was told this was normal by the dealership on two occasions when I took it in for service.  They told me to ""add oil"" to it and it would be fine until the next oil change.  I have had more oil changes on this car in the one year that I've owned it.  This car is too overpriced for what you get.","The car is sporty.  I like the rotary engine, as well as the back doors that open out.",Lower the price.  Improve the situation with the car burning too much oil.  No one should have to add oil to a new car!
4.5,Truth,chad ,08/22/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,2,5,"Here is the truth about the 2009 rx8. Fun to drive if you can afford to drive it how its meant to be driven all the time. The heavier your foot is the more oil it consumes, gas mileage is way down there, and if you don't drive it hard you risk flooding, fouling and carbon build up. Run mine hard all the time and still need to clean the spark plugs every 6,000. Trust me it helps! As far as drivabilty goes best piece of machinery I have ever driven! Handling and forgiveness is great, top end is good too, there is an extreme lack of torque though. As far as comfort, seats hold you in, but they are a little hard. This car offers the most fun for your dollar, unless you are a straight line driver.","rotary engine, and handling performance",apex seals need to be more reliable and need to deal with carbon build up
4.375,really fun to drive,shooz ,07/15/2010,,,5,5,4,5,,5,4,2,5,"First new car I've ever owned, now 8k miles. I live in LA and it's terrific to get around town with some style, nimble on the freeways (although it has large blind-spots), and way too much fun in the canyons. Fine in rain but lousy in snow. Engine's quirky but really fun once you get used to it. Doesn't feel underpowered, but I know Mazda changed the gear ratios in 2009, I don't drive below 2800 RPM when in traffic, and I'd never consider this car as an automatic. Precise gearing/steering + sport suspension means your girlfriend probably can't do her make-up while riding shotgun. As designed it drinks oil, about 1 quart every 1k miles, no biggie. I'm 6' and have just enough headroom.","The handling and road grip is terrific; love the engine at high RPM and the feeling of the gearbox. Love the body styling. Interior feels classy. Pedals are spaced close together. Backseats are okay for short hops; suicide doors are a cool touch, and the trunk will fit a couple suitcases.",Fuel economy is my only real gripe.  I get 13-14.5 mpg in the city/freeway. On highway I've gotten 23.  Turbo would be a fun option but outside of a track there doesn't seem to be much point.

I am a car enthusiast that was looking for something sporty and fun to drive. Well, I got both in this car. I bought the 6 speed to add to the enjoyment of driving a sports car. I also picked the Crystal White Pearl which I absolutely adore. I find this car fun and sporty! Just know that you are getting basically a two seater with suicide doors. Don't expect to haul the family around for the back seat has very limited leg room. I am averaging about 16 mpg in the city so if you can't afford Premium fuel, this car is not for you.

4.25,Most fun I have ever had driving 500 mi.,Tryce ,04/11/2010,,,4,5,5,4,,4,4,3,5,"Been waiting for this car since it came out in '04. Reliability issues always made me stay away and it seems Mazda has fixed most of those, so I decided to take the dive when I found one for a great deal in the color and model I wanted. Black R3. Best car I have ever driven, and I have driven a BMW M3. Don't get me wrong, it is nowhere as fast but the handling is superb. When you are on a curve that is posted for 35 and you are going 70 with no hint of body roll, that is awesome handling. I do not encourage breaking the law, btw. Low end torque bad, but once you get into the high rpm in 3rd gear, it feels like a turbo kicks in. Awesome car, not sure on reliability yet, though.","Handling, the look of the body and wheels of the R3, the sound of the engine, short-throw shifter, Bose sound system","Fuel economy of course, low end torque, big blind spot on driver's side due to Ricaro seats being so high and window column being in the way, radio dashboard (what's up with the red digital display above the dials and what looks like a digital display below the volume dial but in reality is nothing)"
4.75,For the empty nester,rvanparys ,03/11/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Kids all gone? Maybe its time to have a little fun... The RX 8 certainly can fill that bill. I chose the car because I wanted a fun to drive car. The four doors were the selling point since we have an Old English Sheep Dog who loves rides... Unfortunately the dog can only sit in the front seat which means she stays home when my wife and I hit the road... That said, there is ample space for grandkids and adults for short trips... Handling is great and the automatic performs flawlessly. Not as fast as a 6 speed but then I am not into racing. Fit and finish is good and seats comfortable on long trips. There is a little more road noise than I would like but you can still hear the Zoom Zoom!",Handling and auto transmission,More insulation in the wheel wells and maybe a redesign on the radio controls.
4.875,Pure Driving Machine,Oleboy ,02/20/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is excellent for people familiar with rotory engines. Knowing up front that the car needs the oil checked every fillup and let it run for at least five minutes before you turn it off. That is really the only obligations you have from regular cars,that I am aware of. This is no problem for me. The sound and unique. The car is not lightening quick but is very fast once to speed. Handling is a dream,at any speed. Nice leather seats and all the stuff that comes in a loaded vehicle. It has a great warranty and the redesigned rotory eliminates the problems (internal leaks) from 04 to 06. It drives great. Get brocure from dealure and test drive one,thats the best way to decide on any car.",Steering and shifting is spot on. Also I like sitting very low to the ground once inside. The touring and R3 have advanced keyless operation on all locks and ignition.,I really think Mazda should put oil cooler screens on these cars at the factory. One rock or peice of metal when on the interstate could easily puncture one of them and all oil will flow out of the system. Would add maybe $30.00 to cost of car. I will have to do this myself.
4.625,Wonderful sports car,AP ,10/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"This car is surprisingly comfortable. Handling is superb: better than my former S2000, STI, Speed3, and of course, Mustang GT. Very easy to drive, even for the novices. Clutch is soft and easy to play with. The gear box is good and smooth but i think the S2000's one is better. Power is linear. Not fast like the STI or the Mustang GT but who care? we cannot use all that power around town anyway. So, i'm ok with my R3 and it's fast enough for me. Smooth, smooth, and smooth engine! no vibration whatsoever when rev it. It sounds very good. This car is unique like no others. It's fun to drive and the bottom line is i just love it more than all other sports cars i had in the past (don't know why).","Handling, very stable at any speed, easy to drive, wonderful gear box, comfortable for sports car, smooth and sweet engine sound, unique, special, classy.",Gas mileage (but not that important since this is a sports car). I don't care about the rear seats. Get rid of them and make it a pure 2-seat sports car!
4.875,Outstanding sport/family car!!!,Popeye ,07/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought this car for my wife after her Stratus got totalled in a 7-car pile-up.  All other cars we looked at were all the same.  Line any brand, make or model up on a football field, and they're all the same 'boxy' car. I bought this one for her because of style, then engine, then performance. GAS MILEAGE?  You've got to understand this engine.  Due to its rotary nature, it all boils down to a 6- cylinder, 2-stroke engine.  Typically, 2-stroke engines have never had much power until you reach a speed above city street speed, and fuel consumption matches.  You can drive this car at 80 MPH in 3rd gear (yes, auto also) all day with no problems. Never slides, squeals or tilts much on turns.","Engine (once you understand it) Handling (FANTASTIC!) Roomy, for a sports car. Doesn't slow at hills at hiway speeds, like most cars do.

2.5,Sad Effort Mazda,Colin ,06/27/2009,,,2,3,2,1,,3,3,2,4,"Disappointed, engine stalls. Also prone to flooding if you drive it for less than 40 minutes - not good news with inner city living needing you to shuffle parking spots. The final nail was a dropped rotor. Reported the performance drop off to Mazda, they ""didn't find anything"". Needed a full engine replacement, never again ... and then Mazda Australia comment of ""no customer goodwill will be provided"". Sure could try the legal route, but have not got the time.","Is great car to drive, be nice if it could hold its own in a straight run from the lights rather than just luck pretty - but does corner well. Does not live up the the rx7 blood lines. Plus anyone notice the average age of the people buying ... puts a dent in the ego :)","Interior trim needs work, marks easy and bland. Fix the flooding - not hard but may cost Mazda some $$, which I don't think they have for the rx8 - not enough numbers being moved.

I could never take turns and corners in my Speed3 like I do in my 8. I never got to drive an older model, but the R3 is so incredible at handling, I couldn't imagine a boring drive in any RX8. One thing is for sure, the RX8 is my new choice of car and cant wait to see what other improvements/new models that Mazda will release in the future. Judging by the R3 final product, I know Mazda is headed in the right direction. Let's hope they stay headed that same way.","Suspension, wheels, recaro seats","Obviously, more power.

I hadn't planned on getting another car, but my 15 year old 3rd gen RX-7 was totaled almost a month ago :-(, And I KNEW the ""8"" couldn't match the 3rd gen's stellar performance since the ""8"" is 300-400 pounds heavier, about 110 less horsepower (I'd had some things done to my 3rd gen) and doesn't benefit from the 3rd gen's 50-some-odd better low end torque (compliments of that sequential twin turbo setup). But I knew these things off the bat. But the one thing that's still the same is the razor sharp cornering ability! And the smoothness of the rotary.","The ""performance"" pieces: 18"" wheels, & the strut tower brace. The outer styling has kinda grown on me too. I was already used to the engine and all. And BTW, I'm getting better gas mileage (25-26mpg highway + city) than I got with my 300hp 3rd gen (abou 23-24mpg).","For some strange reason, the gas tank nozzle isn't as vertical as the one in the 3rd gen; so I'm constantly spilling gas when trying to fill it up to the max!

It was hot... this car is not so hot.  Not nearly enough torque.

Having owned a Mustang GT, Pontiac Grand Prix GXP, Maxima, G35 in recent years, this vehicle tops bang for the buck. Style is key since laser radar is everywhere now a days, but cruising in this is awesome.  Smooth and you get plenty of looks, just don't race anyone unless you buy the higher end model.
