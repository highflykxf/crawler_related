I traded in a Mercedes CLK convertible for something reliable, stylish, (especially in the interior) and cargo room.  This delivers!  I would like to see the size just a little shorter, but overall, I am surprised at how much I am transitioning from a sexy, fast, status car to this comfortable, smooth riding, roomy, SUV.  I don't think of this as a wagon.  It has too much style in the interior, for that title.  It's funny, because when I first saw the interior, with the thick, creamy grey leather and black piping, I immediately thought of a Bentley Continental Flying Spur.  I found the pictures to compare the two, and it was amazing how similar they looked!  My friends couldn't believe it!  Now, I'm not saying this Venza is anything like a Bentley, but, when you're driving it, it sure let's you believe you are in one.  :)  I think Toyota jumped ship, too soon, by discontinuing this model.  They just need to give it a new front, a little more exterior styling and shorten it up a bit, and it will run circles around it's competitors!  Keep the interior layout!  We, baby-boomers are used to wood trim and creature comforts.  The kids are gone and we are spoiled.  Plus, we like to shop!  We need a little extra cargo space for all those purchases!

In May 2012 I noticed a noise and had to take it to Toyota 3 or 4 times before they figured out my transmission was already going bad.  Luckily even though it had just went out of the warranty they did it for free because if they would have found the problem the first time it would have been under warranty.  The road noise is insanely loud especially on the highway.  I am now at 122,000 miles and have had clicking in my steering wheel when I turn, and the A/C has started acting up.  At this point I'm seriously considering getting rid of it and going with a Honda.

AWD is helpful in rain and snow and helps it handle better. The steering is slow-ish to react, the transmission often takes an age to find gears, it has enough power but the transmission just can't figure out which gear to put this thing in sometimes. Brakes are pretty spot on. We opted for the cloth seats which are easily the most comfortable seats in any car, though BUYER BEWARE, the leather seats are *miserable.* The interior has held up very well to abuse from kids. The stereo doesn't sound bad either. We have the 4 cylinder, 4-wheel drive model. I would not recommend the 4 cylinder if pairing it with 4 wheel drive. It does tend to struggle a bit. It doesn't quite have the torque it could have. If we could go back and buy the car again we'd easily opt for the 6 cylinder in a heartbeat. They actually get very similar mileage once you realize how uneconomically the 4 cylinder has to be pushed on occasion. It's also clattery and loud. The road noise is also not great either.

My wife is trying to talk me out of it. We both love it. It's dark gray metallic and loaded. I'm a senior with back and neck issues and wanted a vehicle easy to enter and exit. This is it because of its height, and mine. I slip in and out without having to drop down or step up and don't hit my head on the way in. Perfect! The bells and whistles are great as is the leather. Others on my list were Murano, Santa Fe, Edge, GMC Terrain, and used Lexus. ","Overall quality and size, MPG, back-up camera, HID headlights, Blue Tooth and Navigation. JBL sound is great with CDs.

We averaged 22 mpg over the first 7k.  The dealership has been a pleasure from the start.  ""Great Deal""!  Very roomy and comfortable interior.  The leather is a great option.  We use the power tailgate much more than I imagined.  Keyless option also a must, we love it!  The only complaint we have is the very slow to move front power seat.  I am 6', and my wife 5'.  Much adjustment necessary when we switch.  Memory seats would really help!  We looked at other crossovers, and we still believe the Venza is without a doubt the best looking, and best value in its class.","The well thought-out plan for the Venza buyer. Looks great, fun to drive, sporty, comfortable and a great value.  Great job Toyota! ",Please include memory seats.  It takes forever to re-adjust the front power drivers seat.

The car is very dependable with no problems up to the first oil change.  Toyota put a lot of thought into the design. Even at a base model there a lot of features which are standard.

Biggest surprise (and disappointment) was that Cruise Control does not slow car down when set.  It only controls speed going uphill and on flat roads. It should not be called Cruise Control, but ""Up Hill Flat Road"" control.  Car accelerates going downhill, increase of speed contingent on slope.

Even in park, the engine revved so high that smoke poured out from my hood until I turned off the ignition. After 40 minutes of blocking traffic because I was too terrified to turn my car on again, the car was towed to a local Toyota dealer. Now, because their technicians are 'unable to reproduce' the incident, they're telling me it's the fault of my car mats and nothing's wrong with the Venza. The recalled Camrys get an 'accelerator override' system that simply cuts the accelerator when the brake is applied. Why can't they do that??","It's roomy, and comfortable. I drove this thing on a 5,500 mile road trip last summer and it was bliss. Strong on the highway, easy to maneuver.",It's been two days of Toyota trying to make me feel like I'm overreacting to the fact that my car freaked out on me.

(my '95 BMW with 140,000 miles shows much less wear).  What kind of paint is Toyota using?  For the past several weeks, the Transmission Vibrates and Shudders loudly when shifting between gears!

The quality of material throughout the Venza is excellent but build quality seems a little below par.

My Venza options are Security Package, Leather Package & JPL surround sound. Carmax in Laurel, MD has this car and we drove 10 hrs round trip to get it for 27,100 + 99 process fee.  Back up camera is useful, passenger power seat is great (for lower issues), JPL sound is much better than the standard.  4 cyl. does has more engine sound but we want better mpg. It's still worth it.  We don't need AWD because we don't want to drive in the snow.  The higher seats works great for lower back issues.  Ladies, your pants won't get dirty from getting out of the Venza.  We keep our cars for 7-10 yrs, the Venza fits the bill.","Dual A/C & Heating control is terrific, easy in & out, roominess & comfy, rear seat comfort, rear camera, JPL surround sound, regular gas, cargo space, interior storage, exterior appeal, good mpg, leather seats.","Dashboard in black color and hard plastic must go, too much hard plastic for interior, windnoise level, rain rolls down into car seat when door is opened."

4.875,Well Thought out Cross over,Perfect Balance ,01/14/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Purchased my Venza almost a year ago replacing a Honda Odyssey and no longer needing a mini van.  This vehicle has ample cargo space with a easy fold down back seat, lots of leg room in the back seat, comfy leather bucket front seats, and easy access without the need to bend or jump up into the vehicle.  The front windshield allows good visibility and the backup camera is an added feature providing confidence in backing,  It is fun to drive and comfortable, easy to maneuver. Mine came with great Michelin tires. Gas mileage is acceptable for a car this size but wished it came as a hybrid, then it would be about perfect!  Two tone interior is nice and leather luxurious. A bit pricey, but nice!","Satellite radio, heated front seats, wrap around console with lots of room (big enough for a purse to be stowed!)  Hands free cell phone hookup! On slippery roads a few weeks ago handled satisfactorily-can shift down into lower gears as needed. Traction control as well.","Simplified controls for heat/air, modes--too many dials and buttons!

Previously had a Nissan Van and was looking for a vehicle that would sit up as high but not have the van look.  I compared several crossover vehicles and found the new Venza to be the best value. This is a great car inside and out. I compared this to the Acura MDX and Lexus and found I get the same luxury items and reliability for a lot less. During the first month I was surprised how many people commented on how nice my car was and wanted to know what it was, not something I was use to driving a van for over 15 years.  I am spoiled with this car it is the perfect size and has great leg room in the back and lots of trunk space.","Ride and comfort, bluetooth, navigation system, heated seats, auto door and keyless system.

It's got horrible blind spots, the cloth interior is nothing short of junk and the plastic dash and doors is completely disappointing. The road noise is ridiculous. Toyota didn't seem to put a whole lot of thought into this car. I had a Toyota prior to the Venza and loved it, but I wasn't sad to see this one go. You should head back to the drawing board.","Back up camera, info screen (though it could be bigger).","Get some quality cloth like the Camry or Sienna (this isn't exactly a cheap car), do something about the wind noise, try some upgraded material on the interior dash (why all plastic????)."

But after three months and 17,000 miles, I have come to regret the purchase. 95% of my driving is highway, and I drive very conservatively.  I am lucky to average 26 mpg...really expected better from the 4-cyl.  Drivers comfort for extended driving is terrible for a 6' guy!  The seat is inadequate and there is no room to move in the ""Cockpit"" style, very restrictive, front.  Wind Noise and Road Noise is has become very noticeable.  For around town and the short commute, the Venza would be great (except for the noise levels).  But for the ""on-the-road"" crowd...no way!

I consider myself a very good driver (never had an accident or ticket for that matter!).  I was very disappointed not to mention lost confidence in driving the car in the snow.

Once I drove the Venza AWD 4cyl - I was in love.  I never wanted a 4cyl, but the pick up, is that of a 6cyl.  The interior space is as much if not more in comparison to the the GMC Envoy I drove previously.  I find the car handles very well.  All space on the interior was maximized by the design of the storage.  The center console has ample storage. We already own a Toyota Camry, so overall trust the Toyota name.  Only 3 months in, but the Venza is living up to the brand.  I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a car/suv and interested in a crossover!",I love the style of the car as a whole. I love how it drives and how well it does on gas.  The storage is fantastic.  The back up camera is nice.  Love the dual sunroofs.

I bought the 6 cyl. This vehicle is definitely a head turner.  People stare at it and ask what it is.  I get a lot of good comments about it.  As far as the ride, it is a little rough on bumps, but I think this is due to the 20 inch wheels. The interior is very roomy.  Even with my grandson's car seat in the rear seat, we have plenty of room. I just love the heated seats, bluetooth, satellite radio, and all the extras I got with this vehicle.  It handles beautifully, sort of sportslike, which I also love.  ","Bluetooth, heated seats, rear seat room, remote hatch, backup camera, just the look of both the inside and outside of the Venza are beautiful.

I had back surgery in May, and needed a better ride. Even without the leather, the car is a dream to ride (we are 1/2 way through a cross-country tour).  Didn't have a NAV, but for $100, I use a wonderful Garmin.  For everyone complaining about the steering...it feels that way because it's electric steering.  It's not a German car, so there's little or no ""road feel"".  But that's okay.","Roominess, storage, visibility, and hopefully, reliability.  And I really like the appearance (and the Blizzard White paint).","Why the silly old key design?  The car seems like it was a collage of excess inventory from other platforms (when a door is open, you can't tell which one because it just gives a general ""there's a door open"" icon).

I wish I could take it back!  A lack-luster 23.5 mpg average and 90% of that is Highway and non-aggressive driving techniques.  The driver's seating and placement is extremely uncomfortable after only an hour or two of driving (makes me wish I had my Honda Odyssey back).  Road Noise at Highway speeds is excessive!

The Venza has met all my expectations. I feel that this vehicle is at the forefront of car technology.  Superb acceleration and brakes.  Drive feels very good, despite what reviews say.  Own a copper-colored version: I've had people stop me at gas stations to ask me about the car, and to congratulate me, specially about the color. I feel proud driving this car.   Love my 20-inch tires, even though they say they affect the ride and are costly, but they do make the car look good!  Passengers express how comfortable this car is. Not a single technical problem so far. Got 30 mpg in highway.","Color, looks, acceleration, ride, brakes, comfort, lights, interiors.  Regret did not go for leather seats and better stereo.

I average about 350 miles per day, or six hours of driving time.   In two months time, I find myself needing a doctor's visit.  The back of my legs ache terribly after driving this car!   I have tried every adjustment possible but cannot get the seat to where it is not causing discomfort and probably restricting blood circulation.

Positive comments & questions in parking lots. Had to have windshield replaced due to a stone - took the red truck guys 3 tries to get the right one. Apparently 2 different shapes, depending on options, plus heated/not heated. Hard to spot the wires under the wipers. 3 tries was a charm. Still prefer our '81 Subaru 5 speed manual for snow - seems to leap onto the snow rather than plow through it. Did get used to downshifting with an automatic. Still dislike rim design and how they accumulate snow and ice causing the vehicle to shake at higher speeds.

I work around a lot of noise so when I get in I don't like to have to have the radio on, but it's the only thing that will drown out the noise.  I've taken to the dealer three times and their best response is, all we can tell after driving yours and another new one on the lot, the wind noise is inherent to the Venza, to me this is unacceptable in a brand new vehicle.

Dash is massive and makes vehicle feel huge and more like an RV. Good cargo room with or without rear seats down. Good pep and fairly agile for size. Been driving a BMW X3 and wanted more cargo room, which this has but handling just doesn't compare, even though ride a bit smoother. Sloped front end makes parking a bit of a challenge in tight spaces until accustomed to it. Feels a bit like driving one of the giant sedans of the 60's. ","Roominess, ride. Priced well to compete with SUV market.","Should have memory seats with more adjustments. Dash should be given some design changes to keep it from feeling so massive. Reduce wheel size and tighten steering - feels ""bouncy"". Since windshield rises high into the roof, should tint more heavily at top,  blocking sun can be a challenge."

We wanted a car that was SUV-like, but more of a sedan interior.  We have a Honda Pilot which we both like very much, and we thought the Venza would give us sedan characteristics with some SUV features.  We were right in making the decision to buy the Venza.  It has exceeded our expectations.  We love the ride and handling.  The mileage on two trips has been between 26 and 30 mpg.  It is extremely comfortable for both my wife and I.  I'm 6'4"" and she's 5'2'.  We both fit the car nicely.  We chose the sunroof option and I have no problem with headroom.  The V6 has way more zip than the 4 cyl that we test drove.",Our faves are the acceleration.  The great handling on curvy roads.  The auto tailgate has been very handy while shopping and traveling.  Plenty of space to pack items for a long trip.  The nav system is one of our favorite features.  Satellite radio with traffic warnings works well too. ,"My wife wondered immediately on seeing the car and price, where is the auto seat adjust?  That was the only feature we thought was missing."

Noise: I contradict on the critics comments on the wind & road noise- Driving at 65mph and can hear the crisp and crystal clear music at level 6-7  maybe the premium JBL system (std on venza) is the performer. Engine & Mileage: V6 is powerful but fuel efficient. Driving between 50 mph-65 mph highway will give an avg fuel consumption of 27-29 mpg... isn't it wonderful!!!

I had a Cadillac DeVille and I averaged 25-27 MPG on the road and thought Toyota would give me better.  Wrong!!!  I only average 20.9 on a highway trip.  I also have a ""Thump"" sound which seems to come from the right rear but the dealership cannot find any problem.  Being a single woman, I really have my fears that the noise could be something to do with the wheels on the back and dangerous. The plastic on the dash and steering wheel could certainly be improved.  It is a nice car, drives wonderful, turning base is great but the MPG makes me wish I had my Cadillac back.",Style of the car is beautiful and the automatic cargo door and spacious cabin are great!,"The lock on tilt steering wheel is so tight I have to take 2 hands and really work on it to get it open or closed.

The fuel economy is good, I average about 21 around town, 27 on the highway.  Really like the sunroof and push button start, the power rear door is helpful with the kids and large packages.  Yes, the ride is taughter than other Toyotas, and you do sit higher than in a Camry or Avalon, but that's the design.  It's not a wallowing, bucking SUV that gets 15 mpg and can't take a turn or accelerate well, that's for sure.  And it's no minivan that is more of an appliance than a fun to drive vehicle.  A few gaps and misaligned seams in the dash, other than that, I really like it!","Sunroof, pushbutton start/no key entry, power rear door.  Synthesis sound system w/Bluetooth.  Lots of storage, big room back seat with easy fold seat backs.","Just like everyone else, I would add the USB port for the Ipod, memory seats/mirrors, and two-part sun visors.  Also, Toyota needs to make the LCD display on the radio better...it only shows the 1st 13 characters on XM radio...no scrolling like on CDs.  It also washes out in the sun."

The V6 AWD version has plenty of power and the 20"" wheels are not as bad as I read in the reviews; this car really turns heads.

The interior is very well thought of with all the amenities you can ever need including 3 power outlets. The smart key system is fantastic and cabin space is very generous. My average MPG is probably about 20 with mixed driving, not the best but no worries since I only drive 10 miles to work.

The inside (w/leather pkg, incl woodlike trim) is actually beautiful.  Agonized over 4 vs 6 and am so glad I got the 4. While not a screamer, this 4 jumps like a rabbit from standstill, 40-60 and even passing at 60-70. Performance with the 4-cyl was a pleasant surprise, and hwy mileage of 29 (!) is fabulous for a car this big.  Ride is quiet and smooth and handling is also very good, esp for a big wagon.

However we are greatly disappointed in the ride quality.  We did not take the car on the freeway during our test drive which was a big mistake.  The Venza picks up every nook and cranny on the highway/road.  Of course the roads in California are poorly maintained and made. It is running the 19 inch wheels and Bridgestone Hueler Tires which from website reviews are not good tires.  The Venza bounces back and forth and up and down to the point it almost undriveable.  We use to have a Nissan Murano which drove twice as good. I wish I could take it back and get back our old IS300 Lexus.,Stereo good and controls are well placed except for the forward window lifts controls which should be moved back aft.,"Better ride quality - different tires, shock or suspension improvements."

We get the same gas mileage in a 4 cylinder as we did in the Accord. First two trips on a fresh engine got us 28.8, so its right on the 29 sticker. Plus no more brake problems like all late model Accords. Love the comfort and room. The back seat is one of the most comfortable of any I have ever sat in. 4 cylinder has plenty of power and the V6 is just plain fast for a family size car. Plus, it just looks great.

Very comfortable, smooth ride and a quiet cabin. The interior is very comfortable and Toyota spared no expense in the design. It is the best interior I have seen. I opted for the 6 cylinder. Let me tell you, if you are not watching what you are doing, you can find yourself traveling at 75-80 mph with no effort at all.

4.75,It really is as good as it looks,VenzaBuyerIL ,08/17/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We spent a long time deciding between the Venza and the Lexus RX 350, Audi Q5, Infiniti EX35 and Volvo XC60. While the Venza is a crossover, these others are small luxury SUVs and are priced similarly-equipped at about a $10K higher sticker price. We have not been disappointed by the initial quality, ride and features in our vehicle.  My only serious complaint about the vehicle is the quality of the plastic used in the lower half of the dashboard; it says ""Corolla"" more than luxury and this is about the only oversight I have found. Otherwise, I suspect we have as much a car as the ones listed above, but at a significantly more economical price.  I am very happy with my choice.","Rear DVD (quiet kids), smooth ride and responsive handling.  The upgraded JBL sound system is excellent.  Rear back-up camera is a nice feature.  We like the smartkey system and power tailgate so well that we are considering switching our other car to one that has smartkey.","Quality of some interior surface choices, e.g. plastic on the lower half of the dashboard is really quite cheap-looking and feeling.  The in-dash NAV and sound controls takes some time to get proficient.  It would be nicer to be instantly user friendly like a lot of the cheaper NAV systems."

I liked the Venza because it was similar to the Camry and I knew that I would have a short learning curve for Navigation, etc.  The seats are quite comfortable and the Navigation has nice voice-controlled update from the Camry.  Love the 20"" wheels and the AWD.  Obviously, mileage is less than the Hybrid, but for the V6, it is not bad.  Still breaking in the engine and trying not to go over 55 mph on highway, but sometimes, I get carried away.  Smooth engine and lots of power.","Seats, navigation, daytime running lights, styling, power windows (all) are automatic down and automatic up from driver's seat.

We were actually looking at the RAV4 and Highlander when we spotted the Venza. Like most people we asked what it was and had to take it for a test drive. The ride is smoother than a crossover and has better handling. The increased height makes for easy in and out and overall visibility. Combined gas mileage is about 24 and the 4-cylinder engine has plenty of power for us. Got it with the comfort package which includes the keyless ignition and remote liftgate as well as powered driver's seat with great lumbar support.

This was about 4 mpg better than my 03 Highlander. I usually would not buy a car in its first year of release, but since it was a Toyota product I felt it would be reliable I decided to make an exception and get the car. So far I am glad I did.

I have 3 kids and no one wants to be the person who sits in the way back of a vehicle (in 3rd row seating) which are usually uncomfortable.

While the phone synchs well, recipients of my calls cannot understand my voice.  There is a compatibility issue that Toyota is not willing to recognize.  I would recommend that all IPHONE users not purchase this vehicle.  Absent that, the car is wonderful, but since I paid significantly for this feature, I am most unhappy.",,Fix the I Phone compatibility issue with the BlueTooth through the Nav system.

The Synthesis sound system is one of the best in a car under 50K. The car is very quick particularly on the highway, even when towing my 3,000 lb. boat. The 4WD is a great plus at the boat launch ramp and in the winter. So far I have averaged about 21 MPG.

4.875,What a great car!,M of Ohio ,05/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Prior to this car, I had a Rav4 which I liked. Then My wife bought an Avalon and after one drive, I had trouble enjoying the Rav anymore! I decided it was time for a new ride, but another Avalon didn't make sense because I have a bad back and it is hard for me to get in and out. I wanted something with a ride height similar to a Rav, and the luxury of the Avalon. As soon as I sat in the Venza, I knew it was what I was looking for. The test drive sealed the deal. It has the same 6 cyl as the Avalon, which I really like, and AWD which I insist on with all my cars. The interior is huge, and the ride is as good as the Camry even with the 20"" wheels. The 6 speed trans is silky smooth. ","Huge bucket seats, panoramic sun roof, great looking ROOMY interior, JBL Synthesis really rocks, cool power rear hatch, all 4 windows are auto power up AND down, keyless entry and push button start are a must, 20"" wheels look awesome.

I have no idea what Toyota was thinking when they mounted 19in tires on the 4 cylinder and 20in tires on the 6 cylinder. Replacement tires for the 19's are currently limited to the original tires.  I can only hope Toyota received a great kickback for these terrible tires.  I truly hate them. As a tall driver, I find the wideness of the center center console impedes my comfort.

The Venza has met all of my needs and has been a great car!  I also considered Lexus and Acura crossovers (both were much more expensive, and the Venza had more features that I actually wanted) as well as the Highlander, but the superior second row seating and gas mileage of the Venza made it the clear choice for me.","Keyless ignition and doors, mileage (with REGULAR gas instead of PREMIUM!!), interior comfort, iPod dock, bluetooth, best lumbar support of any vehicle that I considered, black carpet with beige interior (gives me the light interior I prefer with a carpet color that hides dirt and spills)","The one feature that I REALLY miss is memory presets for seat adjustments.

The Venza is like a Camry wagon with the same drive train, length and same suspension as the SE model. The Venza is well appointed and with a few options added, is really nice. The size of the vehicle is just right for most, the seating is very comfortable, and even the six speaker stereo (which we have) is clean and crisp in sound.

I traded in a Mercedes CLK convertible for something reliable, stylish, (especially in the interior) and cargo room.  This delivers!  I would like to see the size just a little shorter, but overall, I am surprised at how much I am transitioning from a sexy, fast, status car to this comfortable, smooth riding, roomy, SUV.  I don't think of this as a wagon.  It has too much style in the interior, for that title.  It's funny, because when I first saw the interior, with the thick, creamy grey leather and black piping, I immediately thought of a Bentley Continental Flying Spur.  I found the pictures to compare the two, and it was amazing how similar they looked!  My friends couldn't believe it!  Now, I'm not saying this Venza is anything like a Bentley, but, when you're driving it, it sure let's you believe you are in one.  :)  I think Toyota jumped ship, too soon, by discontinuing this model.  They just need to give it a new front, a little more exterior styling and shorten it up a bit, and it will run circles around it's competitors!  Keep the interior layout!

5,Amazingly reliable - not sporting at all,Nate ,12/14/2015,4,4,5,,,5,5,3,5,,,"This thing is super reliable. Nothing has gone wrong with it. Nothing. AWD is helpful in rain and snow and helps it handle better. The steering is slow-ish to react, the transmission often takes an age to find gears, it has enough power but the transmission just can't figure out which gear to put this thing in sometimes. Brakes are pretty spot on. We opted for the cloth seats which are easily the most comfortable seats in any car, though BUYER BEWARE, the leather seats are *miserable.* The interior has held up very well to abuse from kids. The stereo doesn't sound bad either. We have the 4 cylinder, 4-wheel drive model. I would not recommend the 4 cylinder if pairing it with 4 wheel drive. It does tend to struggle a bit. It doesn't quite have the torque it could have. If we could go back and buy the car again we'd easily opt for the 6 cylinder in a heartbeat. They actually get very similar mileage once you realize how uneconomically the 4 cylinder has to be pushed on occasion. It's also clattery and loud. The road noise is also not great either.

AWD on demand works better than I even hoped.
Pop the hatch and pull the handles to release the rear seats and you've got a ton of space to load up.
Optional roof rack where I mounted my bike and ski racks is great.

I average 20 and get around 25+ on highway.","Heated mirrors should not be an option.
This is the flagship of Toyota ""cars,"" so don't make me get a several thousand dollar package for a minor feature that costs $10 in parts and has no real design complications.
Maybe it's just my particular car, but the roughness at idle is far worse than my '91 supra.
The wheels look cool and the car handles well given its ride height, but it's a fairly rough ride.

Biggest surprise (and disappointment) was that Cruise Control does not slow car down when set.  It only controls speed going uphill and on flat roads. It should not be called Cruise Control, but ""Up Hill Flat Road"" control.  Car accelerates going downhill, increase of speed contingent on slope.  I took it to Dealer and they said that's the way Cruise Control works on this car.  This makes Cruise Control on long trips worthless.  I've previously driven German cars and never had this issue.","Body style, intelligently designed cockpit.","Cruise Control is worthless, as it doesn't slow car down when going down a gently sloping road.  It only controls speed on up-hill & flat roads."

4.5,Great vehicle,GRP ,06/03/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,3,4,4,"My wife and I are seniors and find our Venza a great car/wagon/etc. It's the golden umber mica paint and we get many compliments of it's look. The drivers seat is not especially comfortable and I see in other reviews that is a common complaint. As the main driver I find it necessary to get out and stretch in an hour or two. Hard on the butt. Ours is not leather, but leather look and affords easy access and egress. Mileage - Overall since new - 27.45 MPG Best mileage -on a trip  37 mpg Worst mileage -in winter ""09"" 17 mpg ",We love the rich interior of the car and the fact that all parts fit nicely. It's a pleasure to drive.,Make the seats more comfortable - softer.

Really good gas mileage 19/26. Ride is more sporty than the Lexus, but still comfortable enough for us.  The Michelins do make a difference. We decided on the Venza vs another RX Lexus which we loved. Price was a strong consideration. We trust Toyota and think they are getting bad press. It's a keeper for us. A good looking SUV/crossover. ",Love the power and good fuel economy. The sun roof and large glass panel makes the car that much more roomy feeling inside.

It's built like a bulldog, wide and low, great design and aerodynamics. I haven't had any problems with this car so far, and I have over 20,000 miles on it now. We took it on a trip to Cooperstown, NY and it was a great, very comfy. ","Interior is designed to be extra roomy, wider than most cars, lots of leg room. I got cloth seats and they are very comfy.

Lots of space in the 2nd row and rear cargo area that works smoothly and efficiently in our part-time service biz. Nice misc storage including water bottles in the door, and love the flexible multi-compartment console. Four cylinder has more that adequate power. I get 26-28 MPG in mixed driving and 30+ MPG on the Hwy, but I have a light foot. Radio and environmental controls are easy once you get used to them. The backup camera doesn't work too well in bright sunlight, but works great in lower light conditions when it's needed the most. The leather is very nice, and the overall interior design is well thought out.","Eye catching exterior styling, smooth pleasant ride, roomy and efficient interior, multi-compartment center console, radio and environmental controls, information computer with 2 line display, current mileage display, and good gas mileage.","Softer seat cushions. I concur with others, the seats begin to get uncomfortable after 3-4 hours in the saddle, when my wife and I have to get out and take a break due to tailbone ache. Seat adjustments don't fix this, as this seems to be caused by slightly too firm bottom seat cushions."

Even in park, the engine revved so high that smoke poured out from my hood until I turned off the ignition. After 40 minutes of blocking traffic because I was too terrified to turn my car on again, the car was towed to a local Toyota dealer. Now, because their technicians are 'unable to reproduce' the incident, they're telling me it's the fault of my car mats and nothing's wrong with the Venza. The recalled Camrys get an 'accelerator override' system that simply cuts the accelerator when the brake is applied. Why can't they do that??","It's roomy, and comfortable. I drove this thing on a 5,500 mile road trip last summer and it was bliss. Strong on the highway, easy to maneuver.",It's been two days of Toyota trying to make me feel like I'm overreacting to the fact that my car freaked out on me.

(my '95 BMW with 140,000 miles shows much less wear).  What kind of paint is Toyota using?  For the past several weeks, the Transmission Vibrates and Shudders loudly when shifting between gears!

Twice now the engine has suddenly surged very SEVERELY and LOUD for about 10 seconds or so. It sounds like it goes from a normal idle to a sudden maxed out, floor-boarded throttle! We had around 3000 mi on it the first time this happened, and then this last time 9200 miles. It's been in park both times its happened, but we're afraid its gonna happen while driving.  Toyota checked it over thouroughly and couldn't find anything wrong. The car is perfect outside of this problem.

There's plenty of room in the back seat for adults or a child seat. Plus the trunk area has tons of room for bulky items or a large dog. The downside for all this room are lots of blind spots. The quality of material throughout the Venza is excellent but build quality seems a little below par. My passenger seat rattles when nobody is sitting in it, lots of wind noise from the driver door and excessive road noise on highway. I was disappointed with the AWD during the snow this winter and actually parked my Venza and drove my wife's Subaru.

The instrument cluster is easy to read . The brakes are predictable and good,  Better rear washer/wiper control. Improve cruise controls.

I am lucky to average 26 mpg...really expected better from the 4-cyl.  Drivers comfort for extended driving is terrible for a 6' guy!  The seat is inadequate and there is no room to move in the ""Cockpit"" style, very restrictive, front.  Wind Noise and Road Noise is has become very noticeable.  For around town and the short commute, the Venza would be great (except for the noise levels).  But for the ""on-the-road"" crowd...no way!  ",Styling and the electronics are great.,"For this price point and style of car, the Wind and Tire Noise, and the lack of driver comfort is totally unacceptable!

I loved it til the snow came.....it cannot handle hills of any kind with the Bridgestone tires it was sold to me with.  The car stopped, slid, fishtailed everywhere.  I consider myself a very good driver (never had an accident or ticket for that matter!).  I was very disappointed not to mention lost confidence in driving the car in the snow.  Thank God I have a Suburban too.  I will try again but I need to purchase snow tires instead of the all- season i bought it with.

How is it said? You can pay more. But, you won't get more. The only items Toyota should consider is illuminating the homelink buttons along with the window lock button. The leather seats are very nice. However, clothing dye is a problem. It will not come off the leather.

Once I drove the Venza AWD 4cyl - I was in love.  I never wanted a 4cyl, but the pick up, is that of a 6cyl.  The interior space is as much if not more in comparison to the the GMC Envoy I drove previously.  I find the car handles very well.  All space on the interior was maximized by the design of the storage.  The center console has ample storage. We already own a Toyota Camry, so overall trust the Toyota name.  Only 3 months in, but the Venza is living up to the brand.  I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a car/suv and interested in a crossover!",I love the style of the car as a whole. I love how it drives and how well it does on gas.  The storage is fantastic.  The back up camera is nice.  Love the dual sunroofs.

I bought the 6 cyl. This vehicle is definitely a head turner.  People stare at it and ask what it is.  I get a lot of good comments about it.  As far as the ride, it is a little rough on bumps, but I think this is due to the 20 inch wheels. The interior is very roomy.  Even with my grandson's car seat in the rear seat, we have plenty of room. I just love the heated seats, bluetooth, satellite radio, and all the extras I got with this vehicle.  It handles beautifully, sort of sportslike, which I also love.  ","Bluetooth, heated seats, rear seat room, remote hatch, backup camera, just the look of both the inside and outside of the Venza are beautiful.

I had back surgery in May, and needed a better ride. Even without the leather, the car is a dream to ride (we are 1/2 way through a cross-country tour).  Didn't have a NAV, but for $100, I use a wonderful Garmin.  For everyone complaining about the steering...it feels that way because it's electric steering.  It's not a German car, so there's little or no ""road feel"".  But that's okay.","Roominess, storage, visibility, and hopefully, reliability.  And I really like the appearance (and the Blizzard White paint).","Why the silly old key design?  The car seems like it was a collage of excess inventory from other platforms (when a door is open, you can't tell which one because it just gives a general ""there's a door open"" icon).

I wish I could take it back!  A lack-luster 23.5 mpg average and 90% of that is Highway and non-aggressive driving techniques.  The driver's seating and placement is extremely uncomfortable after only an hour or two of driving (makes me wish I had my Honda Odyssey back).  Road Noise at Highway speeds is excessive! You cannot drive with just one hand or the steering starts shaking (maybe the 19"" wheels?).  Hit a medium-sized dog at 50mph... the front-end fell apart.  $3,200 damage!!!

The Venza has met all my expectations. I feel that this vehicle is at the forefront of car technology.  Superb acceleration and brakes.  Drive feels very good, despite what reviews say.  Own a copper-colored version: I've had people stop me at gas stations to ask me about the car, and to congratulate me, specially about the color. I feel proud driving this car.   Love my 20-inch tires, even though they say they affect the ride and are costly, but they do make the car look good!  Passengers express how comfortable this car is. Not a single technical problem so far. Got 30 mpg in highway.","Color, looks, acceleration, ride, brakes, comfort, lights, interiors.  Regret did not go for leather seats and better stereo.

I average about 350 miles per day, or six hours of driving time.   In two months time, I find myself needing a doctor's visit.  The back of my legs ache terribly after driving this car!   I have tried every adjustment possible but cannot get the seat to where it is not causing discomfort and probably restricting blood circulation.

Positive comments & questions in parking lots. Had to have windshield replaced due to a stone - took the red truck guys 3 tries to get the right one. Apparently 2 different shapes, depending on options, plus heated/not heated. Hard to spot the wires under the wipers. 3 tries was a charm. Still prefer our '81 Subaru 5 speed manual for snow - seems to leap onto the snow rather than plow through it. Did get used to downshifting with an automatic. Still dislike rim design and how they accumulate snow and ice causing the vehicle to shake at higher speeds.

I work around a lot of noise so when I get in I don't like to have to have the radio on, but it's the only thing that will drown out the noise.  I've taken to the dealer three times and their best response is, all we can tell after driving yours and another new one on the lot, the wind noise is inherent to the Venza, to me this is unacceptable in a brand new vehicle.

Pickup: Good. Did well on the ups and downs of the Alleghenies. Noise: I contradict on the critics comments on the wind & road noise- Driving at 65mph and can hear the crisp and crystal clear music at level 6-7  maybe the premium JBL system (std on venza) is the performer. Engine & Mileage: V6 is powerful but fuel efficient. Driving between 50 mph-65 mph highway will give an avg fuel consumption of 27-29 mpg... isn't it wonderful!!! Tire: noise is also very low (have 20"" Michelin). Seats: Leather seats are comfortable for a 4-5 hour dive at a stretch.","Excellent Navi, Voice Navi, Bluetooth works great.

4.375,Nice but improvements needed,Nana ,09/18/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,2,5,"I purchased this beautiful car for 2 reasons: No trunk to lift out of and better gas mileage.  I had a Cadillac DeVille and I averaged 25-27 MPG on the road and thought Toyota would give me better.  Wrong!!!  I only average 20.9 on a highway trip.  I also have a ""Thump"" sound which seems to come from the right rear but the dealership cannot find any problem.  Being a single woman, I really have my fears that the noise could be something to do with the wheels on the back and dangerous. The plastic on the dash and steering wheel could certainly be improved.  It is a nice car, drives wonderful, turning base is great but the MPG makes me wish I had my Cadillac back.",Style of the car is beautiful and the automatic cargo door and spacious cabin are great!,"The lock on tilt steering wheel is so tight I have to take 2 hands and really work on it to get it open or closed.

The fuel economy is good, I average about 21 around town, 27 on the highway.  Really like the sunroof and push button start, the power rear door is helpful with the kids and large packages.  Yes, the ride is taughter than other Toyotas, and you do sit higher than in a Camry or Avalon, but that's the design.  It's not a wallowing, bucking SUV that gets 15 mpg and can't take a turn or accelerate well, that's for sure.  And it's no minivan that is more of an appliance than a fun to drive vehicle.  A few gaps and misaligned seams in the dash, other than that, I really like it!","Sunroof, pushbutton start/no key entry, power rear door.  Synthesis sound system w/Bluetooth.  Lots of storage, big room back seat with easy fold seat backs.","Just like everyone else, I would add the USB port for the Ipod, memory seats/mirrors, and two-part sun visors.  Also, Toyota needs to make the LCD display on the radio better...it only shows the 1st 13 characters on XM radio...no scrolling like on CDs.  It also washes out in the sun."

The V6 AWD version has plenty of power and the 20"" wheels are not as bad as I read in the reviews; this car really turns heads. The ride is still on the firm side but Toyota managed to compensate it with the suspension design. The interior is very well thought of with all the amenities you can ever need including 3 power outlets. The smart key system is fantastic and cabin space is very generous. My average MPG is probably about 20 with mixed driving, not the best but no worries since I only drive 10 miles to work. All in all it's a wonderful and fully functional crossover that I am pleased with and will keep for a very long time.","Smart key system, stats display, V6 AWD.","With the price, they should've made the sunroof, JBL synthesis system and backup camera standard in all V6 models."

The inside (w/leather pkg, incl woodlike trim) is actually beautiful.  Agonized over 4 vs 6 and am so glad I got the 4. While not a screamer, this 4 jumps like a rabbit from standstill, 40-60 and even passing at 60-70. Performance with the 4-cyl was a pleasant surprise, and hwy mileage of 29 (!) is fabulous for a car this big.  Ride is quiet and smooth and handling is also very good, esp for a big wagon.

However we are greatly disappointed in the ride quality.  We did not take the car on the freeway during our test drive which was a big mistake.  The Venza picks up every nook and cranny on the highway/road.  Of course the roads in California are poorly maintained and made. It is running the 19 inch wheels and Bridgestone Hueler Tires which from website reviews are not good tires.  The Venza bounces back and forth and up and down to the point it almost undriveable.  We use to have a Nissan Murano which drove twice as good. I wish I could take it back and get back our old IS300 Lexus.,Stereo good and controls are well placed except for the forward window lifts controls which should be moved back aft.,"Better ride quality - different tires, shock or suspension improvements."

We get the same gas mileage in a 4 cylinder as we did in the Accord. First two trips on a fresh engine got us 28.8, so its right on the 29 sticker. Plus no more brake problems like all late model Accords. Love the comfort and room. The back seat is one of the most comfortable of any I have ever sat in. 4 cylinder has plenty of power and the V6 is just plain fast for a family size car. Plus, it just looks great.

The Highlander was too expensive and the handling characteristics of the Venza is much better.  The car feels more balanced than the 57/43 front/rear weight would suggest.

To our surprise, the Venza is very spacious. Yes, we do not have the third row seating, but we only used it when family was visiting. The first time I test drove it, I was hooked. Very comfortable, smooth ride and a quiet cabin. The interior is very comfortable and Toyota spared no expense in the design. It is the best interior I have seen. I opted for the 6 cylinder. Let me tell you, if you are not watching what you are doing, you can find yourself traveling at 75-80 mph with no effort at all. The first time I passed a car on a two lane road caught me off guard with the great power.

We experienced 26 MPG on this highway trip and cruised at 80 MPH during large stretches of the trip.  The Venza is also a good day-to-day vehicle.  It is quite capable of hauling small to mid-size items (groceries to small furniture items).  Acceleration is surprisingly good.  It feels ""heavy"" during cornering.

While the Venza is a crossover, these others are small luxury SUVs and are priced similarly-equipped at about a $10K higher sticker price. We have not been disappointed by the initial quality, ride and features in our vehicle.  My only serious complaint about the vehicle is the quality of the plastic used in the lower half of the dashboard; it says ""Corolla"" more than luxury and this is about the only oversight I have found. Otherwise, I suspect we have as much a car as the ones listed above, but at a significantly more economical price.  I am very happy with my choice.","Rear DVD (quiet kids), smooth ride and responsive handling.  The upgraded JBL sound system is excellent.  Rear back-up camera is a nice feature.  We like the smartkey system and power tailgate so well that we are considering switching our other car to one that has smartkey.","Quality of some interior surface choices, e.g. plastic on the lower half of the dashboard is really quite cheap-looking and feeling.

Combined gas mileage is about 24 and the 4-cylinder engine has plenty of power for us.

My husband is a big guy and we spent a whole day going from dealership to dealership to find a car with comfort and room size. Everything is made so compact these days but when we sat in the Venza we could not believe the room and comfort of this classy looking vehicle!! Just took a trip to New Jersey 6 hrs each way. We have made that trip many times in Lincolns and Grand Marques yet never enjoyed it like we did our Venza!!! We get 23 miles City and 28 Highway!! Just took friends out with us yesterday for a trip to the Cape and they were amazed at the comfort of the ride and the room in the back seat, one of them is very tall and said he has never been so comfy in any car.",Love everything about it!!

This was about 4 mpg better than my 03 Highlander. I usually would not buy a car in its first year of release, but since it was a Toyota product I felt it would be reliable I decided to make an exception and get the car. So far I am glad I did.

I have 3 kids and no one wants to be the person who sits in the way back of a vehicle (in 3rd row seating) which are usually uncomfortable.

Better mileage, excellent view for drivers that like to sit a little higher on the road.  The comfort of seats was equal to a Lincoln we tried out before buying the Venza.  Just a great vehicle, but probably built for four adults.

Now when we flip down the DVD player it completely blocks the rear view mirror causing huge safety concern, Also If cops notice that you may be liable for penalty as well.  On top of the safety issue they plugged a wireless-audio DVD player which signals to the existing radio... that's disgusting... you always hear static and the volume is bad.

We have owned a Ford Edge, which drives like a truck. The Venza drives like a luxury car.  We drove both the 4 cyl and the 6 cyl Venza.  The 6 cyl has better performance and had a better response time. The engine on the 6 cy is a lot quieter than the 4 cyl.  We ordered our Aloe Green model with leather and without the Nav. Our Garman does the trick, we can take it with us when leave the car, and we can update the GPS on our computer.","Easy entry for a 6'4"" driver and passenger. Comfortable seats.

The Venza has met all of my needs and has been a great car!  I also considered Lexus and Acura crossovers (both were much more expensive, and the Venza had more features that I actually wanted) as well as the Highlander, but the superior second row seating and gas mileage of the Venza made it the clear choice for me.","Keyless ignition and doors, mileage (with REGULAR gas instead of PREMIUM!!), interior comfort, iPod dock, bluetooth, best lumbar support of any vehicle that I considered, black carpet with beige interior (gives me the light interior I prefer with a carpet color that hides dirt and spills)","The one feature that I REALLY miss is memory presets for seat adjustments.

It even looks similar to the Lexus-I love the low to the ground entry-exit-my Venza is fully loaded- the only negative is the fuel efficiency-but I love the fact that I have more room than the more fuel efficient Prius.

The Camry, I feel, never got the recognition it deserved for being a true hot rod both in sheer speed and handling while also being quite docile in everyday driving. The Venza is like a Camry wagon with the same drive train, length and same suspension as the SE model. The Venza is well appointed and with a few options added, is really nice. The size of the vehicle is just right for most, the seating is very comfortable, and even the six speaker stereo (which we have) is clean and crisp in sound. Sitting next to my built '77 Cherokee provides quite a contrast.","Auto climate control, drive train, seating, and the really big 20"" wheels!

5,Venza hits a sweet spot,Bill ,02/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Downsizing from a suburban I was looking for something smaller, yet would still have the suv characteristics. The Venza is easy to get in and out of. I love the power of the v6 and with AWD it really goes through deep snow.The rear seats are comfortable even for adults which is rare in most suvs. The drive is very smooth and the large speedometer makes it easy to avoid tickets. It seems to be a very safe winter car as I have yet to lose traction. Toyota claims you do not get your pant leg dirty on the door sill, yes it works well. The transmission shifts are smooth and I rarely feel them. Dual temp controls are a bonus as my wife and I set at different temps. The dealer treated us nicely.","The power hatch release is great. I use it all the time. I also like how the rear view mirror changes at night time so you do not get the blinding lights in your eyes. The acceleration of the v6 is quick, it performs like a v8 and it is very quiet. AWD is great as there is no buttons to press.", Would like to see a memory seat position. Powered tilt and telescopic steering wheel. Push button start standard.

5,A Hit for Toyota,d2scion ,02/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Love the vehicle. I bought it for my wife but I am kind of jealous of her now. This vehicle has the Lexus quality without the price.,"Dash layout, seating design, upgrade nav, panoramic roof, power rear hatch, shall I continue?","Better mpg (20.6 avg) :-(, memory seats, cooled seats like the Avalon, simple but helpful booster for the hood prop like the Camry."

5,Very happy new Toyota owner,Diana ,02/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Smooth and in control. Easy maneuvering, enjoyable very smooth steering, precise. Braking and acceleration just as great. All driver controls from the steering wheel to the easy no-reach dashboard are wonderful. Turning and cornering feels very stable, safe, and smooth. The gear shift is exactly where it should be, easy to reach, natural. Solid comfort. So easy to ""crossover"" from an Avalon to my Venza.   ","Smart key, steering and total comfort. Optional space with fold down back seats. Ability to buy a much more affordable car versus the Lexus or Mercedes crossover. If you're debating between the regular stereo system versus the JBL surround, stereo is fantastic, sound is great.","None. Once again, Toyota has another winner."

5,Awesome new line!,Cassandra ,01/31/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just picked up my Venza yesterday. It rides really smooth, I didn't get the moonroof with Nav option. But its fully loaded with everything else plus I received some free accessory items that I didn't expect.  It has fast pickup, plenty of legroom, heated seats and a great dashboard that will tell you everything from gas mileage info to temperature info. Comes with the Satellite system free for 3 months. Buttons are right by your hands, so you don't have to stretch over anywhere. Futuristic design on the body, very different. Lots of cargo room and has bigger tires than your usual standard car. Lighted dashboard at night very well illuminated and bright. ","Bright illuminated dashboard at night, backup camera in reverse, button all close to hands, starter push button only no physical key needed.",None as of this review. They included everything people really want.

5,Nice Refresh to the Toyota Line-up,Chris ,01/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the Venza yesterday; 3.5L V6, FWD, and I absolutely love it. I bought it to replace 2 cars, an 03 Solara and an 07 Camry... Loved how the Solara handled, & liked the look of the Camry. With the Venza, now I get both in one package. The handling is very responsive, smooth, and the turn radius is a lot sharper than I expected for it's size. The JBL 13-speaker system upgrade is definitely worth it if you are an audiophile and love music, & there is no doubt that the interior was designed to be the visual definition comfortable and convenient. The smart key is great, so you can keep the keys in your pocket while you lock, unlock, start & stop the car.. all via touch.","I like the Bluetooth option, w/ the ability to dial by name or number, and auto-sync on car entry. I love the convenience of the smart key, because I know as long as I have the key on me, I have full access and control of the car. The drive is solid and responsive, and the design is nice all around.","There may already be a way to do this, but if so it was not clear in the instructions: I would suggest to add a way for you to remotely start the car from outside, then simply get in & drive away. As of now, you can start from outside, but the car is locked; upon unlocking it, the engine shuts off."

3.75,"Venza: good stuff mover, great snow car ",M EF ,01/29/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,2,4,"I bought this 6cy AWD explicitly for very long drives along the Great Lakes Snowbelt in winter - dangerous conditions. I held my nose while considering SUVs and minivans.  This car was a reasonable compromise. The seat is firm and surprisingly comfortable on a 500 mile drive.  The vehicle handles firmly and assertively unlike Toyota's other models.   I call it a vanagon; it felt large at first, but it really is more like a tall sedan than anything else. I have a black one with that ridiculously toothy chrome grill, which seems to be a desirable feature on higher-end vehicles.  But it goes like a tank in the snow and hauls a medium amount of stuff. Expect good resale from it and I feel safe.","The interior is roomy - the back seat is truly comfortable for two tall adults.  The center storage console actually fits my entire purse, which I really like. Super easy parking and good snow driving. Braking is so so.","The stereo sounds inferior and I hate the heating system controls.  The trip computer is inaccurate and the mpg (20 hwy) seems low compared to projections.  The cowl on the back side of the steering wheel is loose and clicks underhand, very odd. The rear headrests obscure vision and need removal."

5,"Venza or Camry - Easy Decision, Venza!",dave ,01/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Needed the ease of entering and exiting vehicle that a SUV offers rather then sitting down into a sedan.  This was the perfect choice.  In between a sedan and SUV.  Picked it up last week, first one sold at dealer. Impressed with design and performance. The base model comes with all the features you would expect to pay more for in Camry LE. Dual A/C, fog lights, power driver seat, instrument display for temp, time, trip, lighted vanity mirrors, built in satellite radio, nice rims, tinted glass. Far more value and features then Camry LE sedan model offered let alone roomier. ","Surprise feature was the centre console with tons of space to store goods, sliding centre arm rest and holster for blackberry. ","None, it is great! Very satisfied. "

5,Beautiful luxury,rdd ,01/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Purchased a black loaded 2wd Venza. Pretty much everything is on it. Extremely nice to drive. Replaced a 2007 Camry V6 Limited. Navigation is much improved. JBL stereo is also much better then previous model. Handles pretty well for a tall vehicle, Automatic high beams is kind of unusual, takes some getting used to. So far we both love it.",Stereo. Navigation system. Dual sunroof.,Memory seat and steering wheel settings.

5,Great New Toyota Design,Art ,01/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We picked up our new Venza yesterday, 3.5 V-6, AWD, leather, nav, tow pkg - all options except rear DVD.  Very impressive vehicle, outstanding build quality inside and out, solid handling and cornering, fast (0-60 in 6.8 sec) excellent ride, reasonable mileage as near as we can determine, but it's a bit early for numbers. The nav and audio are a lot more user friendly and better integrated than the system in our '05 Odyssey. The floor is flat for easy entry/exit and the rocker panels are totally covered by the doors.  Clever touch, especially for the gals,  keeps your clothes clean in rainy conditions.  Dual moon roof adds a large rear non-opening panel.  A crossover-wagon mix, excellent. ","Nav-audio-Bluetooth integration, back seat room (scads of it), dual moonroof, innovative door design and construction, excellent power and ride, System display panel centered under windshield prevents driving distraction. (I am a retired USAF research pilot and cockpit design is very important!)","Only one - for some reason, memory seats are not an option. OK for us, the heated 8 way & 4 way power seats are fine, but those whose spouses are much shorter or taller may wish for it.  And some may desire cooled seats as well, like on the Avalon. "

4.75,Best New Wheels,Walt Bardua ,01/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"This is a vehicle whose time has come. It is exactly what I was looking for in 01 when I bought my Highlander. It is loaded with all the latest Toyota features and has all the utility of an SUV without the SUV downsides. If my test drive was any indication, I'm going to really enjoy this vehicle. The fit and finish are superior (what we used to expect from Toyota). And it comes without the hefty price tag of the new SUVs.","Interior space, style and features.",None yet.

I know it's a sort of station wagon but it feels like a sports car :), very comfortable, fast and stylish. Coming from an SUV I'm very satisfied with this purchase!!!  If you're looking to downsize check this out!   Very nice! :)","Heated seats, leather and navigation system; compact and so sporty!",n/a
