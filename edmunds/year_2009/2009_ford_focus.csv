This car though, what a dream! Though nowhere near a sports car like the PT GT, it's INCREDIBLY fun to drive! The shifting on this car is more smooth than I could imagine an MT (Manual Transmission) to be. All the creatures comforts and more with AC and XM Satellite radio! The suspension is SO soft! Even hitting a giant pothole on accident doesn't feel as dramatic as it is! The gas mileage is awesome! I only travel short distances, so mine may not be the same as others, but 35 MPG in the dead of winter is more than incredible for me! ","I'll try to go in order:
* Shifting - This car is a MT, but shifting with this car is beyond amazing! It's is so smooth.. You don't get any of the ""hrumph"" when going to another gear (Like you would on other vehicles no matter how much you babied the clutch).
* Suspension - Another incredible highlight of this car! Even though it's a used '09, I can't stress enough how incredibly brand new it feels! Mercedes look out!
* Roomy Trunk - Though small, this car features a very boisterous trunk with plenty of room for cargo and other items! 

* XM Satellite - I only had to call up Sirius XM and give them my VIN and payment info and I had instant access to all XM channels! 

*Stereo is AWESOME!","My following suggestions are subject to current features... Which is to say, if these changes would deplete in ANY way from the rest of the vehicle, I would suggest NO change at all. 

Larger cabin for the back passengers. Though the front of the cabin is very cozy (even as a tall person), the back barely covers enough space even for my daughter in a car seat. More leg room in the back would be nice, but I would most certainly sacrifice this in favor of what the vehicle currently has.

The ambient lighting is a major plus, definitely adds some serious style to the car. The speakers sound better than any car I've heard, especially with the 8"" sub package.

5,Beat our Civic,alwaysyodeling ,08/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We have been long time drivers of the Honda Civic which is a nice small car. Our FORD Focus has been a delight and we think a big improvement over the Civic. Nice tight fit,good pep,easy handling, fun, mileage 36-37 on highway driving usually at 75mph. Feels roomier inside and when I had to put four adults and baby seat in there was no problem. We had a Ford Escort 1995 that is still going for friends at 200,000 miles. The Focus feels like that kind of solid but more jazz... Oh yeah nice SYNC.",Turning radius beats Civic.

5,Super-Fine Focus!,Jay ,08/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"   The Focus has been all we could have hoped for, and MORE!  The MPG is better than advertised; the ""fit"" is perfect; the Sirius radio is a great feature; the roominess, including a very large trunk, is wonderful. I would HIGHLY recommend it to any friend who was looking for a similar- sized car.  ",   See above!,   That they make the Sirius radio a 12 month feature.

5,So far I'm impressed !!,gqlefty ,08/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5," Thanks to web-sites like this one, my selection process was easier to make. We downsized from driving an Expedition for the last 10 years.  Haven't had it long but so far this SEL has made the change an easy one and my wife loves it. Especially the GAS bill !! My son drives a 99' V6 Stang and it has been bullet- proof. So I lean towards driving another Ford product. Ford has done their home work on this one and has a winner for a small car. Ford must be reading these reviews because my SEL has 3 headrests in the back seat(2 would be enough) and an inside trunk release which earlier models lacked. Will report back in about 20K miles to update my review.  All for under $19K, I'm very impressed","Everything others have mentioned.... 6 air bags, Fit & finish, solid build on a small car. Rides more like a midsize sedan. Roomy, easy to get in and out of. Very competitive price compared to others in its class. Yes, the sound system is very nice !! Test drive one and make your own conclusions!",Nothing serious but ....needs inside gas cap lid release button....cargo net in trunk....4 wheel disk brakes std. Kumho tires are quite on good roads but not so much on average ones. Make tail-lights continue on to trunk lid probably would look better and more visible from the rear. Logos to large.
5,The best American compact out there. ,srcej6 ,08/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've been extremely pleased with my 09 Focus SE coupe. I chose the 5spd because I personally can't stand to drive a car that doesn't have a lot of torque paired with an automatic. With that said the clutch uptake is very smooth and the pedals are well spaced for heel toe downshifting. The shifter itself could be shorter but the detents for the gears are positive.  The car rides like a midsize sedan, very quiet and smooth. It's leagues above my friends 08 Cobalt in ride quality and noise control.  While it's no drag racer it definitely is entertaining in the twisties, with the 4wheel independent suspension. Not only does it soak up bumps mid corner with ease but it is also very forgiving.",I like that it has power everything (except seats) and heated mirrors. The steering wheel controls for the radio and leather wrapped steering wheel. Also Sync is a very easy to use system that helps you keep your eyes on the road while trying to change albums from your MP3 player or make a call. ,Bring back the 2.3L from the earlier model Focus ST. Also 4wheel disc brakes would be another nice addition.

4.5,"Zippy, fuel efficient, and spacious.  ",PJ ,08/11/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,5,5,"I bought a fully loaded Focus SEL with manual transmission.   This car is simply designed beautifully.   I am 6'4"" and easily have plenty of headroom and can get 2 adults in the back without moving the seat.   The stick shift is very smooth and ergonomically placed.   This car zips nicely and gets me over 31 mpg so far.   The sync system is really cool but the one complaint I have is the speaker placement.   If you drive with the windows down like I do the wind noise really drowns out you stereo.   They need to raise the speakers higher so they are closer to your head.   Also,I got the SEL which makes the interior really nice.  I noticed base models seem to have really cheap interiors.","Gas Mileage, Manual Transimission, Interior space, SYNC System.","Better speaker placement, need to get the SEL model to avoid cheapo interior materials."
4.125,Pleasantly Surprised,Madison ,08/11/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,3,4,5,3,"Just purchased this weekend as a commuter car (130 miles/day round trip).  I really like what Ford did with the re-design.  The old version was pretty ugly, but this one looks good for an econobox.  After only 250 miles, getting almost 40 on the highway and 33 overall in a fair mix.  I'm 6'3"" and the two door allows easy entry and exit - plenty of legroom.  Performance is about what you would expect from a N/A 4-banger - not spectacular, but sufficient.  Sirius is cool.  First Ford I've ever owned, so we'll see how it goes.  Impressed by the fact they didn't need a bailout and they actually had inventory to choose from.  So far, so good.  ","Love the legroom that the coupe provides.  Dash lights look cool at night.  Lots of options for a commuter car - doesn't look like a rental car - tinted headlights, spoiler, aluminum wheels, exhaust tip. 5 speed seems very well sorted out - not clunky at all.  Huge trunk, rear folding seats are nice",More road noise than my 10 year old Chevy ton truck with a rubber floor (tires?).  Interior door pulls in a weird spot - way forward on the door.  Would be nice if seats could be slid forward from the back seat for easier exit by passengers.  Tilt wheel a little cumbersome.  Needs compass and therm.
3.375,"Okay, but not the best small car choice",Jeff B ,08/07/2009,,,3,4,4,4,,3,2,5,2,"After a week driving a new Focus all over Washington State, I found the gas mileage to be very good (about 31 mpg overall), but the seats very uncomfortable, the handling poor, and the ride bouncy. It is amazing that in 2009 a company the size of Ford can still design such bad (ergonomically poor) seats. No lower back support. No lateral support. The suspension is soft, but when you hit a big bump it quickly bottoms out, and shakes the whole car. Anybody who MUST have an American car may be happy with it, but if you also drive a Mazda3, HOnda Civic, Sentra, etc. you'd never buy this car. Very disappointing.","gas mileage, SAT radio","86 the seats. They need a total redesign by someone who understand ergonomics. Handling is awful.

The loaded SES with 17"" wheels and a 5-speed is very fun to drive.  I wish the option for a ~200HP engine were available.  The suspension in the SES is not as hard as the Honda Civic SI, but handles pretty well for a 4-door.  The seats are extraordinarily comfortable.  The back seats are fairly roomy too. I would buy the car again.  It is a commuter and backup family car for me, so it works out well.  Not recommended for more being primary grocery getter for more than 1-child.

5,Very Impressed,Nick ,08/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I received this as a Christmas present from my Dad this past Christmas. I'm 18 and this was a huge upgrade from my grandma's 1994 Ford Tempo I was driving around. All I can say is wow. It has a good amount of power and the brakes are fantastic. I drive it pretty hard, but I still get about 26-28 mpg doing a mix of city and highway driving. It's hard to explain, but the car just feels ""solid"". The doors close with a dull thud, instead of a hollow bang. Even things like the turn signal lever feel well built. The steering is tight and easy to maneuver, even at high speeds. The ride is overall excellent.","SYNC - by far is my favorite feature. If you don't get it, you are really missing out. It works flawlessly. Also I love the ambient lighting, leather steering wheel, steering wheel controls, dimming rear view mirror, and awesome dashboard lights.","There is NO backseat lighting at all, cloth seats seem like they collect a lot of hair and dirt"

Acceleration on I-71/I-75 in uphill in Northern KY south of Cincinnati rather labored and noisy.  Good brakes, but climate control needed a lot of adjusting.

In the past 3 years I've owned over $100K in new cars and none of them pleased me like my Focus does.  I went from a 2009 Honda Accord Coupe V6 and 2008 Honda Civic Si before that, to this car and could not possibly be happier.  It does not rattle at all, unlike junk Hondas, and gets killer gas mileage.  It rides like a bigger car than it is, which is awesome on city streets when you're hitting potholes and cracks.  I hear no road noise.  It is very, very quiet even with the ""sport"" muffler on the 5 speed coupe.  SYNC blows away the Bluetooth in any vehicle I've owned.  I cannot say enough about how good of a car this is.

The automatic transmission shifts smoothly.  I like the decent gas mileage and the smooth ride.  Sometimes on hills the acceleration seems very slightly slow.  I've put over 14000 miles on it since I bought it last September and so far it runs great.  Trunk space is a real plus.  One thing I'd like to see are hand grips above the driver and passenger doors.  The placement of the interior light needs a rethink also.  It doesn't adequately light the interior because it is too far forward.  I keep cars a long time.  I hope to have good things to say when I put this car over 100,000 miles.  ",,

The Focuss cloth seats arent as nice, but you can get Focus heated leather heated seats for the same price as Civic cloth seats!

I searched for cheaper new cars and finaly picked the focus. I've grown to really like it. Its a good looking car with a sporty appeal. The interior is comfortably roomy and I love the sync and other toys ford has installed in the focus. It has enough power to do the job without a sacrifice in fuel economy.

It's roomy despite being small, performs well (very peppy), is comfortable and quiet (except for the tire noise), gets excellent gas mileage (30 mpg city vs the 24 mpg EPA estimate) and has lots of standard bells & whistles. I opted for a fully loaded (with automatic) model, and for the small incremental difference in cost (only $2,000 or so) you get a whole lot more. There are some great incentives ($3,000 in rebates) on this car right now too, which makes it even more appealing.","Location and layout of the controls, especially the duplicates on the steering wheel. The dashboard backlighting colors are fantastic too. The ambient lighting is OK, but a dome light over the rear seat would be more useful/functional. The trunk is huge for a car this small.","The Kuhmo tires (made in China) are horrible.

4.875,2009 Focus SES Coupe,Techy ,03/23/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this car! The way this car looks in black is stunning. The wheels are dark chrome, the front grill is dark chrome, even the front and back lights have a dark chrome look to them. I may be biased towards that color but it looks much better then any other color offered. The interior is pretty good for a sub-compact. SYNC is very easy to use and to set up. Cloth bucket seats are comfortable. The car turns on a dime and is very nimble, even in reverse with the pedal to the floor. The ice blue dash looks incredible at night with the ambient lighting set to Purple. The standard sound system sounds better then I expected. The trunk is HUGE. You could probably fit grown 3 teenagers inside.","Sync, The whole exterior( black on black), and how peppy it is for a 4 cylinder eco car. The sport tuned exaust gives it a nice roar(growl?) compared to the SE model","The sun visors are a joke. They feel like cardboard with a plastic lining. A lot of the car feels plasticy. Back seats seem like they wouldn't be comfortable for too long, but I didn't get the coupe for back seat comfort. I wish they offered outside temperature and directional display."

So I was a little upset when I had to dish out money (for a rental) from my own pocket 4 months after purchasing a NEW car. Only to have them keep the car all day and tell me that it was the air in my tires??? Well they fixed the air pressure and it still vibrates. Now I  have to have it checked by another mechanic or possible even have it inspected. (All out of my own pocket) All because they refuse to admit there is a problem with the car!!! ,The overall look...but looks are deceiving!!!!,The overhead interior light...can't see anything in the back seat. And either add an indictor light for the windshield washer fluid or move the resevoir some where you can see it. Not much fun behind a truck on the highway...trust me from experiences!!!!
4.25,"Economical car, but not a ""cheap"" car",CellBlock ,03/13/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,5,4,"My Focus was the first car I'd ever purchased, and while I wanted an affordable car, I didn't want to settle for the typical stripped down, no-frills, econobox.  It has a lot of power and speed for a compact; press the accelerator and it gets moving.  It also has some ""luxury"" features, like cruise control, Sync, a 6-disc CD changer, and satellite radio, that you can't normally get in a car that costs less than $20k.  The gas mileage is also phenomenal for a non-hybrid car.  While using it just for my incredibly short commute that consists of more parking lots and sitting at red lights than actual driving, it gets about 18 MPG.  Get it out on the highway and 40 MPG isn't out of the question.","Sync, satellite radio, big trunk, high gas mileage, wonderful visibility (through the side and rear-view mirrors, I can easily 4-5 lanes of traffic - great because I live in the DC area)","More back seat legroom, more spacing between seats and the gear shifter/emergency brake, better/more interior lighting (There's no ""dome light"" per se, just the little reading/map lights in the front; they don't illuminate the back at all.)"
4.75,A great car at a great price,jagar ,03/12/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I own a 2001 Focus with 105K miles, so I tested a 2009 model.  The 2009 model is a quantum leap better than my old car.  The new Focus has excellent handling and a quiet, nimble ride.  Fuel economy is excellent with 39 MPG on the highway and about 28 in town.  I average about 33-34 MPG in average driving and that's with the 4 speed automatic.   I looked at the Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic, but those cars cost thousands more in exchange for a marginal increase in quality & reliability.  The Focus proved a better value overall.  Advance Trac and SYNC are great features that virtually no other car maker offers in an automobile this inexpensive.  Kudos to Ford!          ","Comfortable interior.  SYNC (the biggest improvement in cars since GPS), Advance Trac, Heated Leather Seats, fuel economy, handling, quiet ride, int. & ext. color combinations.  The outstanding reliability of my old 2001 Ford Focus was a huge selling point for the new model.  ","The hood and trunk were misaligned at delivery.  The gauges are sometimes hard to discern and lack contrast.  The audio system sounds muddled and cheap, the result of an underpowered system.  Vinyl covering on sun visors is really cheap.

They short change it on style and rate its performance lackluster.  The truth is, this car is the complete package.  Combine its blend of unique styling, confident handling, quiet/comfortable ride, stellar SYNC system with incredible fuel economy and give-away price incentives and you've discovered what makes the Focus special.  Okay. It's not a performance car, but it doesn't feel like an economy car either.  It's not spirited, but certainly agile.  Import shoppers looking to balance fun, comfort and value really should take an SES 5-speed out for a test drive before shelling out cash for a Civic/Mazda 3/Corolla","Where else can you find dynamic stability control, leather heated seats and 35 MPG for $16 grand. SYNC with Standard Sirius radio really differentiates the Focus at this price point. Nice manual gear box. Well laid out controls. 17"" wheels/tires both look good and do significantly improve handling. ","4-wheel ALB & Electronic Stability Control should be standard. The Coupe is a 1- or 2-person car. If you have kids or plan to use the back seat, get the sedan. Leather seating surfaces do need some visual texture/contrast; no folding mirrors; you'll notice strong crosswinds at highway speeds"

I selected the Focus due to better overall value as for 1200 more the Focus provided Sync and leather seating (plus it looked better than the Elantra).  After 6,000 miles I am quite confident I made a right decision as I have had no issues with it and the car does not get 24/33 MPG as auto tranny is listed.  Rather since the engine has been broken in, it is getting something more like 28/37 as i got 35.9 on a recent 250 mile trip.  The primary downside is the sluggish acceleration performance by the transmission. ","-SYNC!

Very comfortable, smooth, outstanding gas mileage (30+ overall), and adequate power.  Doesn't feel like an econobox tin can ala the Yaris I test drove.

5,More than meets the eye ,Ryan ,01/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a 35mpg (wring out a few more, if you pay attention to the MPG meter) economy car that doesn't make you feel like you are driving an economy car. The motor has plenty of pep for accelerating into freeway traffic, although, it doesn't have much left after 65mph. The car handles very well right off the lot and the ride is surprisingly quiet and comfortable. If you can sacrifice a bit of that quiet and comfort for a greater improvement in handling and style, I would suggest going with the 17"" wheel option with the 215/45 tires. I purchased mine after I took delivery of the car and paid almost double. The car overall feels well-built and reliable. I am very satisfied.","The styling, handling, power and accessories. Nice details and accents around the car make you feel like you are driving a much more expensive vehicle. The in-car electronics are a nice touch. Although I didn't care about Sync when reading the brochure, I now glad that I have it!","Needs a rear disc-brake option. Throttle pedal placement makes heel- toe braking impossible. Some paint underspray, but only in low-vis areas like the trunk.
