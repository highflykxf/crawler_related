I really  have no  complaints.   Not much has gone  wrong.  Vacuum  leak, $350., rear bushings  that was causing  a clunking  noise in rear of car replaced,   and just replaced ecm computer for $650. Rest has been regular and scheduled maintenance.   Car still looks and drives like new.     I learned working at an oil change place, the most important  thing about car ownership  is to replace your fluids at recommend  intervals.  And change oil every 3 to 6 thousand  miles depending on usage.",,

I believe with any mechanical item you own, you need some basic skills to do minor repairs to avoid the dealership and a garage where you know nobody. Repairs made to date by me: gas pedal replacement ($80), vent door blend control ($40), rear power door lock replacement ($75). Repairs done by someone who I knew: Head gasket replacement (about $300 including parts, heard that other owners had the same problem). Transmission fluid change ($100 and recommended highly after 50K). That is all the repairs I have completed to date today and overall, I'm happy owning the car. Time will tell if I remain happy :-)",,

5,Great Daily Driver!,Michael George ,04/30/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,I've been using my 2009 LT impala for the past 4 years and other than a minor problem where one tire would consistently lose air pressure at a faster rate than the other tires I have not had a single problem. Fixing the tire issue also only took 1 day at the shop at an out cost of around $100. It definitely could be worse. Overall this car has served me extremely well whether I'm going to multi-day roadtrips or just driving in the city to school/work. I can't image what more I could ask for from a hand-me-down and I fully expect to use this car for atleast another 2 years before I look to trade it in for something a little faster and more fun.,,

I have had no problems driving on snowy roads - traction and stability is good.
Very easy to do oil changes and I've faithfully changed my oil every 3,000 to 3,500 miles.
Oil filter is in a great location and easy to access.
I average 29 ~ 30 miles per gallon and my drive to work is about 40 miles, most of which is interstate driving.","Head gaskets at 50,000 miles???
If GM would have invested even $100 more on higher quality gaskets, it would have saved them around $2,000 in warranty repairs.
Higher performance gaskets are available . . . use them - the money saved on gaskets did not outweigh the cost of a top-end tear down!!!
Dealership told me head gasket issue was common for the 2009 model.

The interior is cheaply made, but functional, and the driving experience is less than impressive, but the car feels safe. The problem is with the reliablilty and support from GM. Since I have limited space to write this, I'll sum it up. The car is currently at 25k miles and has had a new torque converter, turbine shaft and valve body in the transmission, a new water pump, and the A/C is beginning to put out warm air. GM support (located overseas) has offered no warranty incentives and has been very dismissive.

The honeymoon phase is over.  It is still a practical vehicle with awesome hwy. mileage.  I find the quietness of the Impala therapeutic for my commute home.  It's an almost ""Zen-like"" feeling of peace when I tune out the chaotic world in my car with XM radio.  Even with radio off, its just a quiet and solid car.     ","Love beige leather, sat. radio, folding back seat, & E-85 compatible.  I'm happy with the car.  Disappointed with gaskets at 21,000 miles but GM made it right.  At least gas pedal doesn't stick.

I have owned this car for exactly one year and have had zero problems.  Not one.  Mileage is much better than expected.  On frequent runs to San Diego I average 32 mpg.

After the first 2 months of driving this car, I have to admit that I will miss it and even have wished I had considered this before ordering the Toyota. I have owned several GM's over the years 60's - 90's. My last a 1995 Grand Prix convince me never to own another. However, this Impala has changed my mind. This is a lower end rental unit and I would have ordered a higher optioned model. My only minor complaint is the outside mirrors, they are small and triangular and NOT heated. This is the first car I have owned in years not to have heated mirrors. This should be standard.","Gas mileage. This car is amazing. I took it on an 800 mile trip and averaged 34.5 mpg averaging 70 mph. In mixed urban driving, I am getting 26 mpg. For a car this size it is great.

Strengths-I really like the drivers seat, I can move the seat up (so I dont feel so low to the ground) and the significant back support (which I love). Trunk space is amazing-a great car for families. I like my dark gray interior and the info provided by the Driver Info Center (tire pressure, oil life, etc).  Weaknesses-the dual climate control dials move too easily(you end up changing them more than you wanted to). I wouldn't say it's ""fun"" to drive, but it's reliable.
