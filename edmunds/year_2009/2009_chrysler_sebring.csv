2.5,Not a good car,dewhurst ,03/28/2014,,,4,3,3,2,,3,2,2,1,"I borrowed this car from my grandma when she was out of town for 4 months. During this time, i had to get the power steering repaired twice. Also, I feel like I'm hunched in the car, as the visibility is bad, even though I'm not a tall person. The heated seats are nice, and the interior design is nice. However, now I'm pretty sure I'll steer clear of Chrysler in the future. ",,

4.375,Great Car ! ,alan_qeredaxi ,08/19/2011,,,4,5,4,5,,3,4,5,5,"Well, Unlike Edmund's review and the other reviews, I could find nothing that looks cheap or of poor quality, but some pieces in the interior looks cheap ! I was concerned after reading negative reviews, but the car has grown on me. I tested some cars in this segment including Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, Kia Optima ... It was quiet and smoother. but the Altima was powerful than the Sebring with 2.5L engine. Sebring It's what you want in a mid-size sedan, the car is very nice inside and outside, it has a aerodynamic design, smart intuitive, powerful with I-4 and gushes with elegance, and also the seats are very nice and qulaity, among all of those thing, It is very Stable and economic ! ","Leather seats, Heated seats, MP3 & WMA Player, 6 CD changer, DVD Player, SIRIUS Satellite Radio, Uconnect System, AUX ... Exterior is very very nice and stylish, about the performance (0-60 mph) is not bad but for highway is very good ! MPG is just great, interior is good enough for the price ... PLEASE do not write a bad review's about this car if you don't know about it because it is not like what do you think ... ","more powerful and increase HP, more quite, parking sensor and rear-view camera, LED lighting

4.25,Get the HARDTOP - You'll love it!,Lovitt ,11/05/2010,,,3,4,4,5,,4,5,4,5,"Had it almost 2 years, 50,000 miles.  Not one problem.  Rides smooth (VERY American-style), the 3.5 liter engine has good power.  I get 33 mpg combined.  The top goes up/down in 30 seconds - smooth every time.  The interior plastic is a bit cheap (as others have noted), but the seats are excellent.  I have driven this from Miami to D.C and back.  15 hrs each way, and no back pain.  It's a cruiser!  Dead quiet with the hard-top up.  No leakage during a rain or car wash.  In fact, you can drive in rain with the top down, so long as you stay above 40 mph.  The rain flies over you and you stay dry. People look at you like you're a nut, though. Truly fun Florida car. But it's NOT a sports car.","the looks, the comfort, the touch- screen AM/FM/CD/MP3/Navigation/Satellite Radio, the cruise-ability, the LARGE trunk - with the top up - it is big like a sedan, with it down, it still holds 2 golf bags or 10 bags of groceries.  you can't ask much more of a convert able.",the interior plastic needs to be better.  maybe a bit stiffer on the suspension.

It will be 2 years I have had it soon and have had no major problems with the car.  The car is very quiet with the top up.  The gas mileage is not so good with the 3.5l engine.  The design both in and out is sharp.  The plastic used on the interior trim is cheap and shows wear.

1.75,Why Chrysler is Bankrupt,David ,01/07/2010,,,1,2,2,3,,1,2,2,1,"This a horrible example of why Chrysler almost went out of business. This car has little power and was built with the cheapest parts they could find to forestall bankruptcy. The rotors will need to be replaced under 20000 miles. If you need roadside service, be prepared to wait several hours past the time allotted as the vastly reduced number of dealers is completely overburdened by volume of calls from their unreliable cars. Go buy a Ford or GM if you want an American car - you will be much happier in the long term.",Hasn't exploded in flames - YET.,Never make a rotten car like this again

5,A Beautiful Ride,Tetonka One ,09/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We purchased the 09 Sebring Sedan, Limited. It has all the options that are available. Unlike Edmund's review, we found this car beautiful inside and out. The seats are soft leather. I could find nothing that looks cheap or of poor quality. We have had several complements in regards to the style and accessories. Prior to this purchase we test drove six other cars. The Sebring was the most fun and best looking. It reminds me of a grown up Crossfire. The sound system is fantastic. The GPS, radio, CD, Telephone are operated from a touch screen. Easy to learn. The V6 is responsive and fast enough. The gas mileage isn't as good as the Ford Focus but we are pleased with 27 mpg.","Style,18"" wheels, remote start, heated leather seats, moon roof, sound system, dual exhaust system, color of interior leather, hot and cold cup holder, trunk space.

There's a couple minor blips in the paint, but car looks great, with lots of leg room in the front.

After I bought the cars,I read many many bad things and revies about it,but I found out non of them true,and it's not fair for a good American made car.   The warranty is unbelievable,life time on Engin and Transmition,gas mlg is more than great,the design is wonderful,I read some reviews suggested poor built quality,I don't know about that yet,the car is new now,but I am positive that many years to come will prove it's not true either.

I can't believe the gas mileage I am getting, way better than listed.  On the highway at 65 to 70 miles per hour I get 33 miles per gallon.  It has all the bells and whistles, some I will never use.  It is comfortable for my wife and me to travel in.  The motor is responsive for getting on and off the freeway and passing.  The gas mileage is reasonable and we are averaging 28 miles per gallon.  The radio sound is excellent for a car.  We both like it.  I have has the undecarage done, rust inhibiters, cloth stain proofed and paint protected.  Now the car must respond.","Sound system, tire pressure monitor, gas mileage indicator, adjustable power seats, comfortable seats, good cargo area with separator, great engine.","Looks ok, previous models looked better.

It drives so smooth and has decent pick up.  The look is sharp and it is very comfortable.  I do feel it is ""simple"" in the interior department - not many bells and whistles.  Having said all of this, I did not pay full price for it either.  I was able to get it for under $14k during the cash for clunkers/double rebate from Chrysler.  I do not know if I would have paid $20k for it.  Only time will tell.","Smooth ride, large trunk, comfortable leather seats, good gas mileage","snaz up the interior dash area, add sunroof"

Despite what professional reviewers say this car has a great look on the outside and inside.  The inside is kinda a art deco look and just feels.. classy.  the 4 cylinder is not going to slam you into the seats but it has respectable power and handling.

1,The Worst Car Made,lewisox ,02/01/2009,,,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1," I have driven both this model and the one it replaces and it seems the quality does down while the usability goes up. This is one of the worst cars I have ever driven and am ashamed to call it an American car. Chrysler should really think about doing the honorable thing and just putting itself (and our taxes) out of it misery. Drive quality = F, Confort = F Build = F. The plastic on the inside likes like it was spray painted with cheap rattle can paint and it chips off with a light fingernail. you need a phd to get the top down, the heater is too hot or too cold. the seats are terrible and there is no back seat. Don't buy this car",none,use only for movie car chases with explosion scenes or as a case study of what not to do.
