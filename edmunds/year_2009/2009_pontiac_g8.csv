I originally wanted one when they were new but they were a little too expensive so I went with a used Grand Prix GXP (big mistake). So far I love this car. I get ""nice car"" comments weekly, even by my local GM/ex-Pontiac dealer who apparently doesn't get to service too many of these. If you are looking for performance and value you really can't beat this. For a new car with this performance you'd easily spend $35k.","The exterior styling is awesome, aggressive but still understated, definitely a sleeper. The performance for the $ is unmatched. This thing can run with cars 2 or 3 times it's price including any BMW and any Dodge Charger/Challenger. The sound system is top notch, definitely sounds like an expensive aftermarket system. The reliability has been great albeit from a small sample size. Just had it serviced for the first time with a 4 wheel alignment, oil change, and rear brake pads. But these things are maintenance items so I was okay with it.","Not too many negatives but there are a few. The interior is average. They should have carried over the HUD and leather seats with suede inserts from the Grand Prix GXP. There is a lot of vibration from what seems like the middle of the car when going above 70 mph (which of course I never do). The transmission can be jerky at times but it still feels adequate to handle the large 6.0 engine. I think adding red or yellow brake calipers would have been a nice touch. These really are small complaints, I really do love this car so far."

I see the Aussies have come up with their version in the Commodore sedan with the Vette's Z06 power plant. For the 140K price tag they're talking about I'll stick with modifying my GXP.

Fully adjustable heated leather seats, dual zone climate control, plenty of legroom in all 4 seats, lots and lots of buttons everywhere, how can you go wrong?

It pins you right in the seat just like an old muscle car, yet it has excellent handeling and a comfortable ride. It's a well balanced, well rounded car which can serve as a daily driver in rain, snow or shine. 

It's also a head turner, as a lot of people have never seen a G8 before, so people tend to ask you about it while you're filling up at a gas station. 

It gets great fuel economy considering it's a 6.0l V8. I can get upwards of 28 MPG on the highway and 20-23 MPG around town. 

The comfort, and overall driving experience is excellent. Too much to say about this car...","Use better quality plastic in some of the interior areas. Things tend to creek and rattle a little bit when it's very cold out.

When you have a stressful day and want to unload steam on the road, fun. I had several 1968 through 71 high performance Plymouth products. This car is no match for the money. Loves curves and quarter mile. GM needs to remake in future as an Caprice. Loves gas but who cares",,

4.625,Great Car,RonNV ,02/07/2010,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,I have driver this car for about seven months. Some computer chip issues which were resolved by the dealer. I got big 19 inch snow tires for this baby since it is not really driveable in snowy weather. That reduced the mileage factor slightly. I used to have a problem accessing the highway ramp in my old Buick Park Avenues. With this car you have zero problem..regular or snow tires the car's acceleration is nothing less than fantastic. It is hard to explain but there is a confidence factor that you have with this car. You know that you can pass virtually any car out there. The brakes are excellent and versatility in emergency situations is really good. ,Acceleration. Brakes. Fun factor. ,Better radio. Bluetooth.

4.875,Should have bought 2 of them!,dvick ,02/02/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Purchased my G8-GT before I knew Pontiac was going down the tubes. Did my research. This car has more interior room than a BMW 7 Series, four 6 ft+ people can go cross country, no problem. V8 got me 24.5 mpgs fully loaded going thru desert with a/c full blast! I will keep this car until it craters on me. People still stop me occasionally to compliment the car. After 18k miles, absolutely no squeaks, no rattles, a pet peeve of mine. Performance claims are correct- 0-60 in 5.3, 13.5 1/4 mile at 110 mph- AWESOME for a car that'll haul the family in complete comfort. IF you can find one, BUY IT, but plan on keeping it- but don't worry, you WILL, as it puts a BMW 550i to shame for half the price","squat, powerful looks from all sides with 361 hp to back it up. Solid structure, tight and fast steering, so far good build quality. This is the most car the performance nut can buy for his money, end of story (especially if you have to haul a family around). ","None- wouldn't matter anyway, since this one is history. ATTENTION GM- bring this car back to life as a Chevy Impala, ok? Only problems I've had is with the steering mounted audio controls and a slight driveline hum at 70mph, dealer can't or won't fix- Wish I could buy another one to store for 10yrs"

Biggest problem is watching speed limits, I am old & try to obey the law. Overall I have very pleased with the comfort & performance & especially the reliability so far.

I hated the ""ding"" just from the ride home from the dealership and shut off the overspeed when I got home. Winter tire and wheel package are a MUST if youre in the snowbelt.

Not the nicest interior, and doesn't have all the gadgets, but enjoying the drive is the most important thing to me.  Every morning the commute to work is an adventure.

I do not miss the drama of the BMW service department.","Performance, and I like the radio.

Gas mileage averaging about 18 mpg in mostly city driving.  Nice steering feel, decent stereo.  Two problems so far at about 10,000 miles.  Bad gas cap, no big deal.  Developed a vibration in steering wheel at about 8000 miles.  Dealer said its the cylinder deactivation (active fuel mgmt) system transitioning from 4 to 8 cylinders and there is no fix for it yet.  Went to a tuner and he turned the thing off and retuned to run on super unleaded and reprogrammed transmission shift pts.

Just got back from the dealer and they tell me there is nothing wrong with the car.

I've been a GM guy and in the auto biz for almost 30 years.    12 major malfunctions at 1k miles Paleeeeze. GM seems to have lost it as far as I'm concerned. If you have issues with your car like I do, you will find out what ""The New GM"" is really all about. Based on my current experience, I would not recommend any new GM product.

4,GREAT CAR (EVEN IN V6 FORM),Jerome ,12/09/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,3,5,For the last 6 months I would see a slate gray G8 GT parked in the same spot on my way from work everyday. Each time my head would turn 90 degrees to look at it every time I passed by it. I went to a dealer who said that they did not have anymore G8's left. I went expecting to buy a 2010 Buick LaCrosse. When I got there they had (1) G8 Sedan left displayed on the showroom in Liquid Red. My wife and I took it for a test drive and immediately fell in love with the performance & handling of this car. I've had it for a month now and have been driving with it in sportshift mode and learning how to drive using the the Tapshift. Fun factor increases 10 fold in these modes even in V6 form.,"Sportmode & Tapshift, sporty seats with just enough side bolster to keep you firmly planted during spirited driving.

One of the few early  GT's built with leather delete and Onyx/Red interior. I'm asked questions all the time about the car.  People cant believe that Pontiac was making such a great car, way under the radar. Try to find a four door sedan with a big V8, 6 speed auto trans. and RWD for under 35k. For those who complain about the overall fuel economy, remember that no one twisted your arm to buy a performance car. Can't have the ponies without having to feed them too.  The G8 GT's and GXP's are the final chapter in a long line of fine cars.  If Pontiac had to go, at least they went out with a bang!!","Well, everything is great about the car. I'm 6'2"" and I ride very comfortably in the car.  Plenty of head and leg room. love the auto start feature. Plenty of space and leg room for rear passengers.

This car is the best deal out there in my opinion and after 9 months and 7,000 miles I can say I really love this car.  This is a roomy, fast car that can quickly and comfortably eat up hundreds of miles at a stretch.  The seats are extremely comfortable and the ergonomics just fine.  It's not quite a luxury sedan but it's got all the essentials done well; nothing comes close to the roominess and performance for the real-world cost of this car.  Biggest glitch: came with defective rotors.   ","Love the exterior styling, though the fake hood scoops are a bit much.  Seats are outstanding.  The transmission and engine work together much better than my last few cars.  The acceleration will make you smile every time and the brakes are very good.  Cylinder deactivation means OK highway economy.","In-town mileage is abysmal.  Factory stereo has terribly cheap speakers and I needed to spend a lot of money to upgrade both the speakers and amps. Passenger seat should go back as far as the driver seat does.  AWD option would have been nice. No spare tire included for well over 30K list, really?"

The torque is always available and free flowing and lets the car cruise at highway speeds effortlessly.  Mileage is acceptable on the freeway, quite bad (10 or so mpg) in stop and go.

Next door, there was a Pontiac dealership, and I remember being enamored with the the styling of the G8, but when I had first seen them they weren't available in a manual which is a deal breaker.  Well, the GXP was out, and it was available in a six speed, and it was incredible.  I walked out of the dealership with the new car that day.  It was White, and traditionally, I'd never have purchased a white car, but I didn't care.  This was the beauty with the beats under the bonnet.","The engine is wonderful.  Reserved sounding, not noisy unless you're flogging it, and extremely smoothe power delivery.  I'm also pretty sure that it would make good use of any aftermarket parts.

It beats my previous front-heavy Accord V6 hands down.  And the V8 engine propels the car to highway speeds in a blink of the eye.

The exhaust is quiet until you slam on the gas, then you get the nice throaty exhaust note you would expect from a 6 liter V8.  So far the G8 GT is exactly what I was looking for.  Awesome ride!","6.0L V8 engine, sporty looks, refined/smooth ride, fun factor!",None

The GT looks cool, drives tight and has the most comfortable front seat of my better cars (TL, 300M, Aurora, Legend). I can mention some constructive improvements others have documented, but with research, you know these before you buy, such as the weak sound system, lack of some amenities and weird controls. The only issue after 2 months besides still not having the second set of keys lost by the dealer, is an annoying vibrating noise randomly coming from behind the glove box.

I get great feedback from others on the car and enjoy driving it.

I looked long and hard at the competition - Malibu, Accord, Altima, Camry, Sonata, Lucerne, etc. but this was the winner. I didn't buy it for the rear wheel drive, but for the size and style. It is very sporty looking, agressive even. The interior is clean, uncluttered, and straightforward. The switch gear location, designed to make the switch from right hand drive in Australia, to left hand drive in the US takes some getting used to, but it isn't too big a deal.

No price gouging on the options packages either. There are only three options, and they are all very reasonably priced. Just try to get a Sports Package on a European car for under $600! The car is an incredible value. Fast, great handling, great build quality, great looking. Also very quiet and comfortable. I've had M3s, 3 Series, 5 Series, SAABs and my last car was a Volvo S60R. This car shames them all, and at this price it's a knock out in the first round!","Power, roominess, handling and looks. And unlike any American cars I can think of right off hand (besides Corvettes), they got the stance correct and fender well gap kept to a bare minimum. It looks and feels like it could spend it's whole life on the Autobahn!","Better utilization of the center LCD screen. A real navigation system, a real iPod interface and DVD playback for when I'm waiting for my kids. Also, better quality speakers. The stereo is plenty loud, but it doesn't sound particularly good. The S60R spoiled me pretty badly with it's great stereo."

4.875,Let's go somewhere,Dan ,09/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Had an'03 BMW 325i that I drove to 100K miles, then an '08 Accord V6 that I hated from day 2...their cylinder deactivation was very noticeable, and now have 2K miles on '09 G8 GT. Have the same feeling for the G8 that I had for the BMW...let's go somewhere!  Don't think I will ever get tired of that sweet engine rumble.  Lived in Australia for a few years as a teen and admired the Holden's back then so great to have one stateside now.  I'm in sales and live in my car. Very impressed with interior ergonomics, sound system, seat comfort, and low interior noise level on the highway.  Way to go gm. Wasn't sure I would ever buy another one.  Now if this car just got the hwy mileage of a vette.","Accelerator pedal, stereo, fun factor, sport transmission setting.  My kids keep wanting me to turn off traction control ""spin the tires dad!""","Add memory and full pwr seats, homelink, bluetooth "

5,Rocket on wheels,T23G ,09/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am now into my second week owning this car and wow! You can't imagine how many heads this car turns. Obviously the HP is great out of the hole, but you really notice it on the highway with its passing power. The styling and handling is equal or better than anything I test drove before buying (CTS, A4, BMW 3). I can't believe their isn't more of these on the road already, it really is a big step up for Pontiac and GM. The one thing you really need to know is if you don't want to buy this car, DO NOT TEST DRIVE IT! Once you take it for a spin, you will not want to let go!","Powerful exterior look, enough HP to get someone in trouble, high quality interior finishes, cylinder deactivation for mpg savings, and most of all, its pure sexiness!","Not sure if I love the euro tail lights, still debating.

4.875,Red lights slow us down,Michael ,09/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I bought a Black 09' Pontiac G8 GT and could not be happier. I have been to the gas station a couple times and people come right up to me asking me all about the car. I too love when stopping at red lights and having the car rattle slightly from the V8 anxiously waiting to go. I smile every time I go on a drive and glad this was the first new car I have purchased. ,"Interior lights, sunroof simplicity, and the remote starter for the winter.",Window controls on doors

4.75,Love driving again,Pontiac Fan ,09/19/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Believe the hype. This is a powerful and fun car to drive with comfort too. Thanks GM for bringing it to the states.,"6.0 L, Handling, Seats, Approach lighting, Onstar",Add full power with memory to the front seats.

4.875,GTO + G6 = G8 GT,Jay ,09/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have never had so much fun driving a car ever in my life. I drive like an old man in my G8 GT. Reason being if you hit the accelerator, she will fly!! But when you cruise, the G8 is quiet and smooth. The bucket seats will sink you in for a very comfortable ride. I love the armrest leveled with the controls in the middle for a different feel. Also I love the twitch that shakes from 6.0 V8 time to time from the as you sit in idle at a light. I never felt so good driving an automobile in my life. I have my Corvette for the fraction of the price!!  GM has finally answered our prayers for a muscle car!!","The 6.0 V8!! I let my brother test drive my car at half-time of the Cowboys-Browns game this Sunday. When he punched it, his face lit up like a Christmas tree. He could not believe how much power she gave him!! Also, I like the Blaukpunkt system. Very loud","My only dislike is the fact GM should have gave the G8 a touch-screen Navigation. But I heard they will fix this with the mid-2009 models. Other than that, everything else makes up for this."

5,"Ideal performance, value and  fun blend.",SDG8GT ,09/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My 2009 Panther Black Metallic G8 GT is my first brand new car.  Picked it up with 12 miles on the odometer.  It has the two-tone seats, premium, sport and sunroof.  The 6.0 L V-8 makes getting freeway merging and passing effortless, even when the car is filled with passengers and cargo.  My G8 GT is a head turner and driving in it, is much like driving a in a fish bowl.  At 6'2, finding a comfortable driving position was easy.  The back seat handles 3 real-sized adults easily.  The trunk will swallow 2-3 golf bags no problem.  On a recent road trip we got up to 22 MPG on 87 octane.  A lot of that trip was surface street driving.","Styling, interior room, 6.0L V-8 with cylinder deactivation, and that not a lot of them are on the road - yet.  Build quality is superb.  Sunroof is huge and worth it.  Cavernous trunk.  Steering wheel controls.  Information bank on dash.",Bluetooth should be part of the premium package.  Nav should be an option.  The modules attached to the deck lid of the trunk should be relocated.  Make all seat adjustments a powered affair.  Memory settings for multiple drivers.

5,What a Pontiac,jeff ,09/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,All i can say is this is the best car i ever owned. I can't understand why Pontiac didn't bring this car over sooner. I love the power of the v8 and the mpg are great for the engine size. This car to me handles better than the BMW 5 series. Pontiac needs to do a lot more advertising with this car. Its a 4 door vette. You cant go wrong with this one. It was sold before i even test drove it  ,"Powerful engine, Did I say Powerful engine? I'm talking ludicrous speed",If anything Nav Gm needs Nav in this machine. then again you may be going to fast for nav to keep up

4.875,"So much car, so few back roads",candaceo ,08/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I looked at the 08's in May but so glad I waited to get a Pacific Slate '09. This car is the perfect balance between performance and price and brings back all the passion and enthusiasm for driving that the recent choices between fuel economy or expensive luxury have deprived us of. Driving is fun, fast and effortless and I honestly don't care about no nav since getting there in this car is 'all' the fun.","Amazing performance, silky smooth ride and still room for the boys and the soccer gear.",Manual mode shifting could be a little more positive. Instantaneous fuel consumption gauge and home link would be nice.

4.875,The new GM standard of quality and feel.,Ronny I ,08/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The Pontiac G8 GT is the most fun blend of comfort, performance and style I have ever found in a car in this price class. It is my 1st brand new car of the lot, that is how highly I think of this car I risked to buy it new. It has tremendously good comfort, outstanding acceleration and low interior noise. I've put 4k miles on it in a month, and I'm extremely pleased with this vehicle, it has the best design and layout of the available space in the chassis. Comfortable dash and seats with superhigh quality feel, that was very lacking in previous years. I've had two Pontiac Grand Prix's before this, they served me well. But this is the NEW standard we see from GM. THANK YOU MR. LUTZ for the G8.","Quality feel, interior/exterior roomy space, ergonomic. 26 Mpg on highway on 87 Octane is very good, suspension is awesome, huge trunk and glove compartment, acceleration and steering feel is even better. This is by far an underestimated car in the market, if you try. You must buy.",Paint chips easy

4.625,Stryker Blue Streak,Stryker Bluestreak ,08/22/2008,,,5,5,5,3,,5,5,4,5,"I just bought a 2009 G8 GT, Stryker blue.  The color was chosen by my wife, I wanted Panther black but I am getting used to it! The car rides very well in comparison to my 2004 GTO. The ride is firm but not as harsh as the GTO.  I have not really pushed the G8 yet but I expect great performance.  Fit and finish are very good.  My wife has received many compliments on the car's appearance.  It has sleek and muscular lines. Difficult to combine but the G8 has them.  I looked at the new CTS but the G8 offered a V8, Cadillac didn't, plus, at a lower price point ($10K). I looked at several imports, but I have bought American for over 25 years.  Congratulations to GM for importing this fine car.","Appearance, performance, handling. Design both interior and exterior.  ",Internal gas cap release button. Power reclining seats and power memory presets. More range on tilt-telescoping steering wheel.

4.875,Each Day I Like It More,sa ,08/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I didn't really want this car. It was a gift. Now that I've had it a week, and driven it daily, I've fallen in love with it. I just want to get in and drive.  It's a white G8 GT with all of the options, including 19"" summer tires and two toned seats. I love the V8 but dislike the MPG, then again, what does one expect with a V8?  The previous review said that there wasn't a trunk release button, there is, in glove compartment.","Power, smooth ride, quietness and looks.","GPS, more storage, fold down rear seats. I rated Reliability a 10, yet I would hope any car would be reliable after a week."

5,BMW 5 Series Eater,MTA ,08/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is ridiculous.  Everywhere I go, it turns heads.  Pontiac listened to all the customer suggestions on the 2008 and on the 20009, got rid of the oil & temperature gauges in the center console, added XM Radio standard and no noises other than the awesome purr of the engine as I upshift past overpriced German imports.  The V8 blows doors on everything else in its class while getting surprisingly good gas mileage.  If you want to enjoy driving again, go get yourself a 2009 G8 GT.   ","Mean front end, tremendous power with equally matched timing, great leg room in back seat.",Only thing missing is Navigation.

4.875,Great Car,Race Horse Drive ,08/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I have driven the 2009 G8 GT for a week now. It is a great handling car with unbelievable power.The gas mileage seems reasonable considering the horsepower. I have not had a car that I have enjoyed driving this much since I owned a late sixties GTO. Pontiac really got this one right.,Great performance. Awesome power and plenty of room.,None

5,Own it,Ward ,08/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this vehicle the end of July 08.  Always thought I wanted a Charger.  After test driving both I found I prefer the G8.  It has more power than I'll ever need and very comfortable seating.  My teens vibrate the whole car with their music, but otherwise the sound system in great.  And I found it affordable.",The remote start is so nice.  I'm going to love it in the winter.  But I am used to driving a pickup and the 28.3 mpg that I've been getting is great!,With this car I would suggest a moon roof as a standard option.  It would just complete the package.

4.875,Great First Impression,StevenE ,06/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I was lucky enough to pick up a brand new (45 miles) red G8 in Minneapolis for a week long drive around No. MN, WI and MI Upper Peninsula.  I put 1100 miles on the odometer and developed a great first impression of this car.  It is tight, corners superbly, handles great and drives like a car much smaller than it's size.  GM  really  got this one right!  Acceleration wasn't outstanding with the V6, but balanced against gas mileage, it offered plenty for everyday, long term driving.  I averaged almost 24 mpg for the 1100 miles in combination of driving including pushing it pretty hard on some back roads and freeways.  Nice car...I'll have this one on my shopping list.","Looks great , drew many admiring stares around town! Outstanding cornering and a great sounding exhaust system.",Absolutely nothing major. I did miss a trunk release button. The only one I found was on the key fob.
