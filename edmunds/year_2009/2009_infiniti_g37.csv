After being disappointed with the cts in its unreliability, high repair costs and poor winter driving performance, I did as much research as possible before making my next vehicle purchase. Which led me to three options, the bmw 328i x drive, audi a4 and the infiniti g37x. I'm a speed and drive enthusiast, so of course i was leaning towards the bmw. After doing further research and test drives, i was easily able to make a decision. Went with the g37x for its power, luxurious feeling interior and low maintenance cost. The bmw had the smoothest feeling engine and most responsive steering. The audi had the most comfortable drive. But the one that felt just right is the g37. It's the fastest of the three while still feeling well balanced. It's never been in the shop once yet. Completely satisfied with this vehicle. I think my next car will also be an infiniti.",,

These countless hours led me to the 2009 Infiniti G37, which I bought new in 2009 for $30k (list price of around $35k). I put 155,000 miles on it, with zero problems except for changing the brakes twice, the battery once, and power locks that sometimes didn't want to cooperate. Never got the locks fixed because it wasn't a big deal. I put new tires on twice, and I highly recommend the Michelin Primacy - great in the rain, and last for 60k miles. I spent a lot of time looking at various replacement options, but none had the combination of power, handling, interior space, quality, and reliability. So I traded it in last month on a 2013 G37. Just yesterday I had a $40,0000 BMW as a rental, and I was very happy to get back into my car. The used G37 is without question the best value out there. I feel bad for all the people paying high 20's or low 30's for a generic car with half the power and quadruple the problems when they could have a year-or-two-old G37 for less money.",,

I was skeptical of the mileage but after a friend of mine had a good experience with a 2003 G35 that reached 182,000 miles and only sold it because he needed an SUV, I decided to purchase it. After all it was a great deal. The dealer I work at took the car in as a trade in and was asking $11,600 for it. Since I work there I got a deal for $10,000! This the best purchase I have ever made! The car is in great condition with nothing damaged or worn. The VQ37VHR is a very powerful motor. In fact it is the same engine from the Nissan 370z. Along with the AWD this sedan hooks up even in the rain with the traction control off. This is a very quick car not to mention a good looking one. I have had no problems with the car at all. The Bose sound system is great and has a nice balance in sound quality. The Bluetooth works flawlessly every time. I am six feet tall and the seating position is great. Trust me, I am a very picky person and I am not afraid to speak the truth. This car is exceptional. Anyone in the market for a luxury sedan needs to consider this car.

Loved its sound and corner carving abilities.
But most of all it was the sensuous body that had us sold on it. ","Materials, Materials, Materials.
The cheap leather, the cheap plastics and the cheap carpet are not befitting a $54,000 car.
(See Audi A5) The designers were very short sighted when thinking through some of the issues.
You cannot adjust the seats at all with the doors closed without scratching the aluminum door trim if you are a woman because your ring cannot miss the aluminum no matter how hard you try.
The seat belts were always getting caught in the doors because there isn't a useful retractor.
The leather loop holding the seat belt is ruined after 10K miles.
The finish on the steering wheel rubs off with the least amount of contact.

All is good in the world when the weather is pleasant.

Styling - The car looks great top up or top down.
The interior is also nicely styled and well crafted.

Convertible Comforts - Infiniti really thought about what will make a convertible more comfortable for the driver.
They include ventilated seats, bluetooth that still sounds great at over 80 mph and a Bose stereo with speakers in the headrests.

Performance - The 3.7 liter engine can move the car pretty quickly, particularly when passing.

Value - The car is very competitively priced in the class.
Although not cheap, the G37 is significantly less expensive than its competitors.","Weight - The G37 Convertible drives like a G37 Coupe with a Sumo Wrestler in the back seat.
The extra weight of the roof and structural reinforcements really take their toll on handling and fuel efficiency.

Fuel Economy - Big engine + heavy weight = low fuel economy.
My city driving is typically around 16mpg.
I have gotten 27 on the Freeway with the top up and long distances.
I typically get about 19mpg.

Storage Space - The trunk storage with the top down is abysmal - about 2 very oddly shaped cubic feet.

3.375,Infiniti Hush Money?,bad build quality ,04/04/2010,,,4,5,2,2,,4,4,2,4,"Right after I purchased a 2009 G37 Convertible, I noticed that there was persistent creaking coming from both sides of the rear portion of the hardtop.  That night, I put the top down and up, and noticed that the trunk was opened afterward, so I closed it manually.  The next morning, I approached my car in the garage to find the trunk opened again.  2 days later, the engine refused to go past 10 mph and the Engine Light was on so I was forced to bring it into the dealership.  It's since been over 30 days and Infiniti has tried to solve the problem twice to no avail.  I still don't have my car.  Most of all, I'm wondering where the other bad reviews are? Can anyone say Infiniti Hush Money?  ",Exterior looks.  Best looking hardtop convertible because it somewhat copies the Lexus SC430's looks.  Awesome 13 speaker system with headrest speakers.,Build quality.  Body panels misaligned.  Fuel economy is terrible.  Seat belt fails to retract completely.  Trunk latch faulty.

The all wheel drive is great in the winter and because 60% of the power is provided to the real wheels the car still handles very well like a performance car.  The 7 speed transmission with the ability kick into sport mode is exhilarating.  The 330-hp really performs with this well synchronized power train. The only down side is that I got a speeding ticket my first month because the car runs so smooth and has exceptional power that you need to watch the acceleration or get ready to shell out some green stamps to the police.  The sound system and the instrumentation feel natural.  Small middle armrest compartment is a drag.,Lights let you see 3 times as far a conventional headlights but are accurately aimed so you don't get flashed for blinding other drivers.  The car handles like rally car and has a great sound when you turn it over.  The power is simply amazing and I get 27 mpg on the highway at the speed limit.,"The only improvement would be the arm rest compartment.  It's too small for the Smart phone, wallet, work keys and ipod to all fit in there without moving gear around.  If you need to store change forget about it.

What I loved best about the '04: tight steering, throaty feel and great brakes. Infiniti ruined all three.

4.375,Not overly impressed for the $$$$,Spike1 ,01/27/2010,,,5,4,4,5,,5,4,3,5," Plenty enough power which probably accounts for the less than average advertised fuel economy. I'm averaging just about 20mph city&highway without really pushing it. If you're planning on driving it (mine is the x version),in the snow I wouldn't recommend doing it with the factory Dunlop so-called all season tires. They are useless in the snow, and defeat the purpose of the new all wheel drive system. I replaced mine with the new Continental Extreme DWS's, and WOW...what a difference. Unless my car is an exception, be aware that there seems to be a noticeable lag when shifting from the auto to manual mode.

The car drives really well, wind feels great with the optional wind deflector, and the sound system is awesome. The Sat Nav is almost perfect and the cooled seats put my friends at awe.

Next time Infiniti, make sure the seat belts don't get caught by the door when I get out.",Sound system. Adaptive Cruise. Backup camera. Sat Nav system.

Very strong engine & handling and road feel the equal of any BMW 3 or 5.  Nav system controls are way too busy & confusing.  The show stopper for me is the drivers seat.  Good adjustable lumbar support, but very hard bottom to the point of being painful after 30 mins.

The reliability and value makes it favorable. The brakes are a little touchy but I got used to it.  The exterior style is nice, clean.

When you decide to get on it hard, the rear end breaks free a little sooner then you would expect, but in a very controllable and forgiving manner.

The suburban test drive and the back roads that showed off the handling really didn't reveal how tiring the clutch pedal would become in the city environment where I reside. I have a 2006 Honda Element with manual trans that is a pleasure to drive in the city with its light clutch and precise shift action. It's very, very similar to the BMW 3 Series that I recently test drove. If I could have driven the Infiniti in the city for a day or two I probably would not have purchased it despite its other wonderful virtues.",This is a very high quality car in nearly all respects. Nav is easy to use and the Premium pkg stereo sounds great. Fantastic handling and acceleration with no squeaks or rattles. Shift action is short and precise.,Clutch effort must be reduced and refined. Eliminate engine vibration felt thru shifter. The last time I had this experience was with a 1976 Toyota Corolla I owned when I was 26 yrs old.

The 09 has a bit more acceleration, better hwy MPG and the deals they're offering it's the best bang for the buck in performance sedans right now. The 7 spd Auto in the 09 (compared to the 5 spd in the 07-08) really helps w/ fuel economy. I've already noticed a 2mpg increase on the hwy and the motor isn't really broken in yet. The 7 spd tends to hunt a bit more for gears in speeds under 30 mph but I know there's a Tech service bulletin to have a trans reflash to smooth the shifts, so that'll be taken care of. ","Styling is perfect, doesn't scream ""look at me"" like the Cadillac CTS or Pontiac G8, just very sporty & classy. Decent trunk space for being rather short in the tail. The illuminated kick plates are a nice touch and helpful at night. The Bose premium sound system is quite impressive w/ nice clarity.",Smooth the low gear transmission performance (which the reflash should take care of).

The comfort is quite good, the features are very complete, the size and packaging are good, and the electronics are excellent.  As you would expect, the performance envelope is outstanding.  Excellent power throughout the rev range.  Brakes are strong and easy to modulate.  Handling is responsive and sporting without being at all punishing.  After 2 months and about 4000 miles I love this car.  My G is fully optioned and very comfortable.  Not a single item on the punchlist for the dealer.  Everything works as it should and fits properly.  My MPG to date is about 19, but my foot is heavy.",The NAVI/BOSE is fantastic.  With the hard drive audio I always have about 100 cds at my fingertips.  Better still is the throttle response -- pretty much all up and down the dial.  Lots of gitty-up.  Especially fun in the wet as the AWD puts the power down just fine.  A Screaming Value.  A Best Buy!,"Given the 7 speed tranny, I'm surprised that 7th gear in not setup to loaf even more on the highway -- and accordingly deliver even better MPG.  In this car, 7th is only slightly more efficient than 6th, unlike the gearing that others (notably Porsche on the new PDK) have selected.  Otherwise WOW!"

This car is FAST.  I have to be careful so I don't get a ticket.  I usually keep it in ""D"" mode to tame the horses and for better fuel economy.  I average about 22mpg in city driving. The navigation and premium packages were well worth the upgrade.  This car is just a dream to drive.","Navigation system is outstanding, bluetooth works flawlessly, power and interior design.

After all was said and done, the bang for the buck was clearly with the 09 G37.  The most impressive part of the car's performance isn't necessarily the 0-60 time (although it is nice). I find that its ability to get up and go when already at highway speeds to get around slower traffic and put safe distance between you and others has to be experienced to be fully appreciated.","The strong engine, intuitive navigation/bluetooth system, and athletic handling sold us (me especially) on this car.",Improve the bluetooth/phone/ipod system to be able to have the iphone connected via the ipod cable and still be charging/available for use as a bluetooth capable phone.

Did not like the looks of the Lexus and the BMW was $8000 more WITHOUT a Nav system and other features on the Infiniti.  PLUS the dealership was FRIENDLY and took GREAT care of me.

I have the 4wheel active steer pkg (takes corners at whatever speed without body role... good investment), premium, navigation, tech pkg (intelligent cruise control). The shifting and acceleration is as sporty and amazing as driving a little 2dr lotus!! Braking is as smooth and effective as a $100K automobile... and the best part, it's a quiet, sleek, quality car... without shouting for attention like the MB, BMW etc! ","Short throw shifter (6MT) and acceleration beat many ""sports"" cars out there. Braking is phenomenal, and there's no roll, while taking corners faster. Job well done on the 4wheel Steering. Voice activated features like phonebook, address etc.","It's way behind the powercurve compared to the Maxima (high end) when it comes to options, like the dual moonroof, audio and climate controls at the back seat.

Though the mistake cost me, it was well worth it. The difference between the two cars and the value you get with the G37 made the change something that I had to do. Though the 328XI is a fine car, it does not have the road manners of the G37X.  I have always wanted the G37X and I waited for the AWD to become available in the coupe.

I LOVE everything about it, except the cuphold situation-- or more accurately, the lack of good cupholders.  I ordered the manual version and test drove the automatic.  Different cupholders!  Also, my average gas mileage is about 17.1 mpg.  I would love to get the advertised 19-21mpg. I'm still learning all the features to the car, but I am totally enjoying the navigation system and phone/iPod connection.  Also, the speakers in the headrest is the best. I will say that the Lexus has more trunk space with the top down than the Infiniti.  I only have room for an umbrella and a baseball hat in the trunk.",The convertible part!  The top goes up and down smoothly.,"Needs a better center console for the manual.  The one on the automatic is much better/roomier and has better cupholders.

4.875,Best Bang for Buck Sport Sedan,Robert ,09/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5," The more I drive my G37S Sedan, the more I love it.  In my opinion, it blows the Mercedes C-Class away, destroys the Audi A4, and is $10,000 less than the BMW 335i comparably equipped.   That said, it is a great combination of utility and performance.  The G37 is fast in a straight line and also a great handling car.  Impressively, it feels much lighter than it actually is.   While the G37 is very capable of good gas mileage, it is incredibly difficult to fight the temptation to hammer the throttle.  Hence, gas mileage can be an issue if you have a lead foot.  In short, bravo Infiniti.  You have created a great mix of performance and luxury for a reasonable cost.",Great power band.  Very comfortable.

I checked out the Mercedes C Class, the Acura TL, Lexus IS and BMW 3 Series and none of them comparable to what my Infiniti is.  The handling is great, it's F-A-S-T for a sedan and has everything I need.  Other people complained that the doors not locking automatically but mine do so maybe it's just the Journey model that does so.  If I could change anything, I would have gotten the model with all the bells and whistles (Nav, Bluetooth, etc.) but again, I was coming from an Explorer lol.","The seats. With my back problems, it feels like the seat cuffs my back in all the right places. Push button start is very convenient, I also like the automatic reminders for service.

5,Final Decision - '09 G37 Journey Sedan,RodsterinFL ,05/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I shopped for some time comparing cars-planned on a BMW but the $9000 diff was too much to contend with. The character of the car is amazing. It's a rocket when you want it or a quiet cruiser. Went to the dealer for a coupe came out with a sedan with no regrets. The engine is the MOST responsive I have owned- quick revving. The transmission is great. I have noticed that it does well in just about every situation except for quick stops - can't shift down fast enough I guess. Otherwise it has aggressive shifting pattern that I prefer - smooth and determined. Personally I think the car is under rated always compared to BMW when $ and reliability really make it the better choice. Biased reviews?,The G37's have extensive features. I like the ipod interface and the information screen. The control is easy. I tried the iDrive and it had multi-level menus this is better. My favorite? Intelligent key by far. I like keeping the key in my pocket.

This new G37 may not look like it but it is a great evolution of the G35  Last spring I rented a G35 while on vacation but felt that my B5 S4 was superior after the rental.  The gas pedal was very touchy and the transmission had a mind of it's own. This G37xS feels so solid that it's hard to believe it's based on the same car that I drove 8 months ago.  Anyone considering a BMW should take a G37 for a test drive and try to deny the primal thrill that this V6 delivers at redline.  You should buy this car because it sounds so much better than it's competition.,As a previous Audi owner I must say that ATTESSA is superior.  Interior is right up there with Audi. The engine sounds and feels very good. The front sport facia is beautiful but there are no pictures of it at Infiniti. The multi media interface is simple and logical. ,I can't give the fun to drive a perfect 10 because I can't defeat the traction control and/or stability control.

The AWD Sport is fantastic.  I love the paddle shifters. The car handles very well and it accelerates so smoothly that you barely feel the shifts. The fit and finish are great. I am a big guy and I fit quite comfortably. Everyone talks about the value and I agree, this car is better than every car priced below $65K.

Infiniti was always trying to catch up to the 3 series in terms of performance and styling, and it seems that they finally caught up. To me, it out performs the BMW, with a much more luxurious interior. Plus it's got more ponies (330 vs 300). Let's not even mention the $10k I saved by going with the G. This is the car for the driving enthusiast that wants the performance and luxury","Infiniti did a great job with the new engine and tranny.
