5,Enjoyed my Subaru,dowpwr ,04/19/2014,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Had my 2009 Subaru for 5 years and I really enjoyed it.It drove more like a sedan with the horizontally opposed engine which is one of the reasons I bought this car over the Lexus or highlander.Great in snow, and fun to drive.Peppy off the start.Technology was way behind (nav useless).In fact all the tech in the car was below average, but if you don't care about that kind of stuff it's not a deal breaker.Never had any problems with the car.Gas mileage was low.13 around city.Long trips I'd average 21mpg.Small tank hurt its range.Couldn't get 300 miles without worrying about where the next gas station was.","engine, steering, cornering, acceleration. awd is awesome on this car.","Tech is way behind.
Gas mileage and range is poor. No bluetooth. Nav is not functional.

4.75,Great car,scott2s ,08/11/2013,,,5,4,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I really like this SUV.It drives like a car, handles excellent in the rain and snow and has enough seating for our family.The gas mileage is average for a SUV of this size with AWD but with it would be better.My teen age son prefers to sit in the rear seat and has plenty of space, so not sure why the 3rd row seat gets the bad rap in the Edmonds reviews.This isn't a Suburban and I don't think anyone should expect caverns of storage and lay out seating in a SUV of this size.This is just right for the daily driver and the ocational family road trip.When I need extra storage space I use a $60 hitch mounted storage shelf that I store totes on.Works great to put extra gear.","Drives like a car!
I bought the Tribeca for the AWD and third row seating.
I think the 20mpg gas mileage is on par if you compare with other AWD SUV's in this size.","Gas tank is on the small side.
The side mirrors are very large and do not need to be this size.
I see mirrors this size on pickup trucks hauling a RV, not on a small SUV.
They look like Dumbo ears and create a big blind spot when driving. The build quality is good overall but little niggling things like pitting chrome on the grill or the rubber trunk release button ripping is anoying."

4.5,2009 Tribeca ,evansubi ,12/22/2011,,,5,4,4,5,,4,4,5,5,"I purchased this vehicle 2 years ago. At the time I was torn between the Tribeca and the Toyota Highlander. I priced both cars with the same (7seater, fully loaded) extras. Tribeca came to $39,200 and the Highlander $44,700. Then Toyota was willing to cut approx $1500-2000 dollars and Subaru cut $5000! So my final price for my car came to 34,200 dollars compare to 42,700 saved me about 8000... that alone is a great reason...No problems so far.. Fast (8sec 0-60), economy I get is between 18-20mpg mixed. Drove it to new york ave 20.5-22.5 mpg on 65-85mphOnly concern is front shock sound.. will check at the dealer.. by the way 15.99 OIL Change is also a plus.!!!","Love the interior design, DVD, Navi, pleanty of extras....

More negatives than positives for me.Issue #1 is the fuel economy. I got 15 mpg around town in good weather and 12-13 mpg in winter. The car is great in snow, especially with Hakapelitta snow tires. On the highway, it was a miracle to get 21 mpg. The fuel tank is small - 16 gallons and I was filling it up constantly. Navigation system was weak, a $300 Garmin blew it away. This car EATS headlight and brake bulbs. I installed headlight bulbs 3 times in 2 1/2 years and brake bulbs twice.Dealer parts department told me they sold a ton of bulbs.

Bulb situation is annoying. Headlight bulbs should last longer than 6 months especially when using the dealer factory bulbs properly installed with vinyl gloves to prevent finger oil from reducing bulb life. They are a pain to install and the dealer parts department acknowledged that the sell a lot of headlight and brake bulbs."

It was time to upgrade from his sporty WRX to something more family functional due to the arrival of our first child. I was leaning toward the Touareg or the Cherokee but space was limited. I have always purchased used cars and the 2009 was the only one on the lot when we went shopping. I was pleasantly surprised when I drove it and 15 minutes later I told them ""I'll take it"". It's now been 4 months and all the features meet our needs. I have since added bluetooth, auto start and a dual DVD.

I was really pleased with its snow weather handling, it left stuck 4runners, and trailbazers behind. The car is excellent with overall driving, however issues I have are; very bad mileage approx. 16 mpg, for city, small fuel tank, dated design, dated nav  system, unrealistic third row, the radio steering controls are not practical, no bluetooth, no ipod controls.

We purchased the car brand new. I wanted another Subaru for sure but thought I would try another model. My station wagons NEVER broke down and drove problem free for years. This car had been in the shop due to "" check engine"" light on within the first eight months. Only to be told it's a faulty sensor and is fine. Yesterday my car lost power at 55 miles per hour- NO STEERING, NO GAS, check engine light back on and all I could was coast off the road. The car had to be towed.

Major difference from our fwd VW. I love driving it. Kids love the DVD and headsets. I would definitely get another. Mileage has been better than expected. I drove Montreal to Toronto and managed to achieve 27 mpg @ 65 mph. That is 6 mpg more than the rating. Nav system drove me a little nuts. I could not figure out what the little flag meant. It could have simply stated the word ""Start"".","AWD, DVD, Puddle lights, Sport mode automatic. clean interior design.

It is extremely roomy (professional reviews notwithstanding).  Build quality is superb, no rattles, upscale looking, tons of room for passengers and cargo.

I took advantage of the opportunity to buy a low mileage Tribeca.  While it doesn't have all the features (integrated bluetooth/Nav, express up/down windows, power rear hatch release/keyless entry etc.) it is an extraordinary vehicle that I have come to enjoy very much.  Multiple trips to the North woods of Wisconsin have become my second hobby because of the Tribeca. Fit & Finish, features, quality of workmanship, power/safety/great 4x4, Ipod connectivity, great seats, and best of all; it has Japanese quality control, but is assembled in Indiana.  I love the car, and it may be my last new car purchase. ","Love the interior layout and features, such as the Ipod connectivity.  Great headroom in the car and in entry (much better than my old Lexus). Quick acceleration, strong braking and wonderful handling make this car a comfortable and practical delight to drive. And it is made in the USA. ","Poor Nav system (should have more intuitive and less confusing controls and MUCH better resolution and contrast),  poor gas mileage and unacceptably small gas tank.

Stereo/aux/power outlets are plenty.  Quiet, smooth ride.",Better gas mileage.  Integrated Bluetooth.  That is more a safety issue in this tech connected world.

We knew we were going to get a Subaru, and settled on the Forester, but ended up with Tribeca because of the size of the back seat (can sit between two large carseats comfortably), and a great deal on this model. Initially was not interested in Tribeca because of the high octane fuel requirement, which apparently changed this MY.  Took on its first long road trip, and so far has been extremely comfortable and fun to drive.  It has everything we were looking for in a long-distance vehicle.  The safety features are certainly a great selling point.  There aren't many options/accessories that we feel are missing.  Nice, solid vehicle!","Fun fun fun to drive! Fit and finish/build quality, seats are very comfortable, very smooth ride without being a marshmallow, lots of room, well placed controls, large windows (esp. back), AWD, shiftable 5-speed automatic, loads of standard features.","Gauge layout is not optimal, standard integrated Ipod port, pan.

Subaru's improvement over the years shows in Tribeca-A gorgeous interior design/luxurious feel; sleek exterior lines; ample ground clearance/best AWD in the business; 5-star crash ratings.  Pure joy to be in the driver's seat & has a solid feel on the road. We have driven our Tribeca on 1000 mile road trips of open freeways over weekends; winding steep roads and of course the in-town daily commutes/family and grocery hauling - Tribeca does it all with grace - a solid performer when it comes to merging on highways; changing lanes and passing traffic.","The 256HP H6 boxer engine really performs in Sport mode-even in normal D mode, it has some pep-& all this with unleaded gas.  The dashboard is functional yet has an elegance found in luxury brand models.  Other features we like - steering wheel mounted audio functions; vehicle info display.","We wanted a 5 seat Tribeca but had to buy the 7 seat Ltd for rear a/c vents.

The engine is very drivable around town and the ride experience is as luxurious as the premium brands.  The Tribeca feels more like a car as opposed to the minivan roots of the Toyota Venza and the Ford Edge.  Interior room for five is exceptional and rear storage area is huge.  Build quality approaches the luxury brands.  If you are in the market for a vehicle in this class, test drive them carefully.  My experience did not match up with the reviews on this site.  It was almost as if the experts were driving different cars!!!","Great engine. Taut and responsive handling.

(The '06 is still in the family, and my previous Legacies have made it to the high 200ks with one at 330k - without major repair.) I felt the ride on the '06 was hard & sharp, but the '09 has smoothed that. I feel it is still firm - not soft like the review stated. The driver's seat position has always given me more room than I need (6'1).  Although I like the outside ""look"", I'm one of the few who felt the '06 was original and creative (Alfa-Romeo comes to mind). Now it looks like a Chrysler.  As for interior space, if you need more room, buy a ""box.""",Interstate cruising comfort (21 mpg). Style - in & out. AWD - my Subarus have always been very stable on ice.
