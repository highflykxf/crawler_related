Bought my 2009 mazda 5, and immediately changed the tires to 215/50 ZR17 ( changed speedometer by 1 mph ), this gave a much better and smoother ride, also installed top of the line Bilsten shocks and struts. I'm at 38K on the tires with about 50% tread left, wearing even with normal tire rotations,  and two alighnments. No other issues at all. I  purchased the car with 88K, from the original owner that had all service records ( 3 sets of tires and shocks ), I am at 130K on the car, and other than the normal recommended service, it has been Great.

Very functional for my family of 4 and a dog.  Option for 6 is great when needed as long as it is the exception.  Does everything I need in the summer but when cold weather hits, I think of getting rid of it every winter.  The power locking sliding side doors, manual sliding, will not work in cold or freezing temps.  Took to Mazda and all they did was lube the door latch.  Problem did not go away.  Door keeps trying to lock even when I am driving.  Not a safe feeling when driving and kids are back there.

4.25,Yes,vhabiru ,07/14/2014,,,4,5,4,5,,4,3,5,4,"After about 2 years with the 5, I'm still really happy. We sold the sedan and bought the 5 when we realized we were having a second chlid. It's been really great and at no point have I had a second thought about the purchase. I only wish I had bought the manual and not the auto, but my wife was not keen to have the extra task of shifting in addition to keeping the kids happy. Overall, a solid A. I would definitely buy again.","1. Sliding doors that don't have motors. Straight forward, convenient, won't break.
2. Nimble. I have no trouble navigating this vehicle in the city. 
3. Handling. It's actually fun to drive. It's no GTI, but it will take some decent lateral Gs through the turns. 
4. Control.
A little bit of #2 and #3 together. The 5's steering is very predictable and responsive. The braking is sharp and quick. That let's me feel like I'm in control of the vehicle and able to quickly dodge to avoid maladies that may come my way. An SUV may seem safer, but good luck stopping in time or swerving out of the way.
5. Looks. It's a sharp looking car. I'm not a fan of the 2011-14 design. 
6. Mileage.","1. Internal materials. Don't feel weak but feel plasticky and hastily designed. Function over form, I suppose
2. Road noise. The 5 sits on some low profile tires, and if you don't replace them with premium tires, you get a pretty noisy drive. I don't mind, you get used to it, but you notice for sure.
3. 7 seats. The Premacy (the Japanese version) has a 3rd seat in the 2nd row. That would be nice. With vans, more people is better.
4. Rear seats. This van is good for moving around a yong family, so if you have 4 or more people taller than 4' in the minivan, you're going to be cramped.
5. Cargo space. Not much if you have 6 passengers. Get a rooftop box if you're regularly moving 6."

","Maneuverability - this is a parking lot champ
Versatility - I keep the 3rd row seats folded down most of the time, but being able to carry 4 adults and two kids has come in handy

The cruise and ABS sensors malfunctioned due to snow and slop getting into the wheel well where the sensors were located. Second, an oil pan leak needed to be repaired. Third, the ABS sensor failed for a second time. Fourth, the back suspension squeaked, and the rear passenger shock was replaced and bushings worked on.

With carpet mats and the rear bumper cover, just over $16k out the door.  Very good value.  Interior doesn't match up to what we had in two previous Honda Accords and our 2004 Camry.   I purchased snow tires already after reading how junky the OEM tires are; is there a new car that doesn't have junky OEM tires in this price range?  Despite 5spd auto, car is sluggish. 22-24 mpg in mixed driving.  Manual shift mode is useless.  Only had power steering failure happen to us (knock on wood); covered under warranty.  Bought this car mostly for value and chaffeuring kids.",Handling and braking are very good.   Narrowness of car and sliding doors make it easy to park and enter/exit.  Children like car.  Cargo area useful for changing kids after day at beach.  ,"Jack and location of spare tire leave much to be desired.  Go back to manual climate control.  Self-service doesn't look easy on this car, e.g. cabin air filter.  Use spin-on oil filter rather than oil filter cartridge (messier).   More durable fabric for interior."

It is low to the ground which makes it look nice but watch it when parking into a stall, you will hit some curb's.

We bought Michelin X-Ice2 tires which helped a bit, but it's still not fun driving this vehicle on snow and ice. For a winter environment this is definitely not the right choice","Seats for 6, sliding doors, gas mileage, overall size of vehicle, cargo versatility","More HP for the engine so the manual transmission works for winter/wet roads too! more beefier built, not as flimsy.

We live in Jersey and went to both Bar Harbor & Myrtle Beach and we're very impressed with how comfortable the ride was and the Hwy MPG (we were getting 32 - 34 MPG on 95 once we got out of the DC area traffic and that was at 75MPH with AC!

I probably will never use the third row, but the cargo room is great.  It has all the features of my Mazda3 with more space and better ride.

She wasn't sold on the 5 at first because she likes her ""small, sporty, sedans"".  I knew all along that what she wants is no longer practical, so I let her test drive the Mazda 3 first.  Reality set in when we put the baby seat in the back of the 3.  Our leg room  was definitely compromised.  Next we test drove the 5 and she quickly realized the 5 was most practical for our new family.  This was a tough one considering my father is a retired GM employee and am eligible for the GM discount.  We wanted a vehicle suits our needs now and is fuel efficient.  Unfortunately, GM doesn't carry a vehicle like the 5","Comfortable, roomy (for now), sliding doors, autostick feature, fog lights.  Standard side impact airbags are a great plus.

I wanted better gas mileage, and we didn't need quite as much space, but I didn't want to give up being able to carry extra people, or lots of stuff. This car was the perfect choice. I took it on a 600 mile trip a few days after I got it. We had no problem fitting my family and all of our stuff in it, and when we got there, we were able to fit the other family traveling with us in for short trips. My worst mpg so far has been 23 mpg around town on the first tank of gas. My best was 33 mpg, mostly highway driving on our trip. I have been averaging around 26 (mostly around town driving).

The only vehicle that would come close to it's class is the Kia Rondo and IMO, looks somewhat weird.   So far, the 5 has exceeded our expectations.  Nice sporty styling, great utility, and standard features in this cute gas-sipper makes this vehicle an excellent value.  Some people say that it's underpowered, and probably is with a full load, but it's more than adequate for my driving habits and the manual sport shift makes up for increased performance when needed.  This 5 is fun to drive and you can't say that about a lot of minivans!  We're very pleased with our 5!","Handling and peppiness.  Better than expected gas mileage.

I went in knowing it would be small, and it is, and that's what's great.  Drives like a car, looks like a Matrix, but better, and adds the convenience of sliding doors.  The back seats are Captain's chairs, which makes getting to the third row a breeze.  Adults CAN fit in the third row easily if they're not too tall, so don't let that deter you.  I paid 18,600 for my Touring, and you can't get a six-seater for any less.  No power driver's seat, but it's adjustable 3 ways so you can get it fairly comfortable.

The kicker -- it's the only thing remotely minivan- like that offers a manual transmission.",Manual transmission * Carlike handling * Sliding rear doors * Fold-flat third row seats (loads of cargo space with the third row folded),"* More cubbies and so forth for stashing stuff inside. * Gas cap should be on the drivers side. * It would be nice if the middle row seat track extended a little further back, though I guess that would require making the car longer overall."

While the Mazda 5 is a fine choice as a practical, cheap, do-it-all wagon, construction  is borderline flimsy and materials are cheap. My windshield creaks over every bump and the floor, pedals and steering wheel all take turns vibrating as if the car had 100K miles on it and bad tires.  I hope to resolve these issues soon...

4.5,Small minivan or large station wagon?,PeterK ,03/06/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"My family of 3 soon to be 4 needed to upgrade from our Civic to be able to carry two car seats some cargo and maybe grandma every now and then. We desperately did not want to end up in a mini van and despite what some categorize Mazda 5 as we love the sliding doors which allow pain-free baby loading into the car seat. Cargo room with the third row folded is sufficient but when the seats are up you can't even fit your groceries. Gas mileage is in the area of 24 MPG with mixed driving, enough power to propel 4 adults and a baby on any road or hill. Highly recommended to those who need larger vehicle but want to remain environmentally friendly.","Bluetooth hands-free feature, steering wheel radio controls, automatic Xenon headlights, automatic wipers, heated seats, car like driving and feeling.","Bigger sunroof (it opens up only 3/4 of the length), power seats, bit larger trunk space when 3rd row is up, fuel filler on the driver side (currently on right), dash dim controls someplace else than the hard to reach clocks/speedo, brake and gas pedals spaced more apart, different horn sound"

I am almost thirty and was looking for a bigger car to accommodate more people in the future but also wanted something portable, fun to drive, with great gas mileage.  I stumbled onto this car at the Mazda dealership and loved it. I had been interested in a Honda Fit, CRV, or a RAV4.  This car was the perfect compromise.  My test drive proved this car to be much superior than those I had test driven.  My only fear was that I would buy a ""mini van.""  I think this hip car needs its own category. Perhaps call it a giant hatch back.  Either way, I love it, and it suits my needs.","Flexibility of the vehicle.  Smooth, responsive, buttery steering.  Volume controls on steering wheel.

This is far exceeded the manufacturer claim.  On the last leg of the trip about 90 miles a got 22 mpg. This is really weird since it's all on highway with the same road and traffic condition.  I cannot explain the wide discrepancy.  The second trip on the same road, the mileage was about 33 mpg.  The interior material is a bit on the cheap side.  The plastic scratches easily and the cloth material is not up to standard with Honda or Toyota.  I got this for $17.2k, I am not sure this is a good deal.

I agree with most that a few more horses under the hood would be nice, but I'm OK because I like my gas mileage low. Handles well & looks great! No one ever knows what a Mazda5 is when you tell them but once they see it and ride in it, they become fans!

Our growing family fits perfectly, our four dogs love the folded down cargo area, and we just came home from Vegas through snow with the vehicle handling perfectly.

MPG running in low to mid 20s with mixed city and highway (22 and 24).  I have not had the opportunity for a long drive (300 + miles), but feel advertised 27 MPG for automatic is not only achievable, but beatable.  Vehicle feels quick.

The 5 speed manual is as easy as it gets to drive.  The suspension tuning is 2nd to none, sucks up all bumps with aplomb.  Brakes are fantastic, steering response is spot on.

Got the Grand Touring in Silver with black leather.  While the quality of materials is a definite step down from the VW, the car is a great value for the price.
