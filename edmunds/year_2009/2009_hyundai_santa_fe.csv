How can you drive a car when you don't know if and when you will run out of gas? The USA Hundai and World Hyundai refuse to acknowledge the problem exists even though the internet is full of cases where the fuel gauge doesn't work. The fix is a $500 cost to the owner. Not fair. If a manufacturer won't guarantee that their product is reliable, customers would look elsewhere. We sure will when we buy our next car. Hyundai lists a corporate philosophy on their website. I didn't see anything there about throwing customers under the bus! Bad form !!",,
2,Not Happy with the 2009 Santa Fe.,Keeley ,09/20/2015,2,2,2,,,2,4,1,3,,,"I have been the owner of my 2009 Santa Fe all wheel drive 6 cylinder for approx. 3yrs and I bought it with 38,000 miles. I drive at least 85 miles per day.  First: the 09 Santa Fe drives terrible on the highway. It vibrates terribly and upon bring to dealer they said it was possibly tires or rotation was needed. (I put brand new tires on the vehicle at 45K and at 53k & rotate every year) this never fixed the vibration or the poor handling. Dealership told me I guess that's how it drives and there is nothing they can do. Second: my 09 Santa Fe has a horrible sound system that you can't put up over 14 decibels without blowing a speaker. The volume goes well up to 50. All of the speakers have either blown or went out which I have replaced three times with factory speakers and again they are blown. I have a three year old in the car constant so it's not like I'm blaring rap music with the bass at 10+. Horribly annoying and expensive to fix and not covered.Third & most disturbing: my 09 Santa Fe'a gas gauge malfunctioned at 61,000 miles. After filling my gas tank to a range full line I noticed I drove the car to just above a half tank. After turning car back on the gas gauge needle was buried at empty and gas light on. Very nervous immieditely went to get gas. Only took 18$ to fill. Strange which means it's not empty. Thought was a fluke. Drove to work used 1/4 of tank. Turns car back on after work. Read empty again. After filling the car yet again now using only 8$ I knew there was a issue. I brought to dealer they told me it is electrical. Fully serviced the vehicle through Hyundai.  At the tune of $184.00. Two days later. Started again. After reading on forums this is a severe issue and souls have a recall. It's the tank sensor. Brought back to dealer. They told me to remove old sensors and put new ones it will cost roughly between 500-1000 dollars. It is not covered under warranty and there is no recall. So much for 100K bumper to bumper warranty. This is a severe issue that can cause death or harm. If you don't make sure to reset your miles and keep an eye on your mileage you can run out of gas. The car may even just shut down at high speeds. I would not advise anyone to buy this suv I'm a former Jeep owner and as soon as I get the money to fix the gauge issue I will be selling ASAP and buying either a new jeep or Subaru. The gas mileage is terrible the car vibrates and you don't know if you have gas. Sounds like a death trap to me. Hyundai is putting people at risk with the above issue and should recall the vehicle to fix for free. DO NOT BUY!! Any Sante fa prior to 2011. They all have the same issue",,

4.375,Great Value for an SUV,jerseyan ,01/07/2012,,,4,4,4,5,,4,5,5,4,"I have the 2009 GLS 2.7L AWD. I went from a 4wd Silverado to the SUV with no regrets. My major construction days are done, and driving around paying a fortune for fuel with an empty truck bed 94% of the time seemed like a good reason to let it go. I wanted a new vehicle, without breaking the bank. I opted for the GLS vs. the upscale version not because of affordability, but it had all I needed, why pay more for the more expensive model? It came with the hands free Bluetooth and I added a trailer hitch for those occasional trips to the home centers. The roof racks and crossbars came with the vehicle, but if I had to purchase them, how often do you travel with items on the roof?   The 3.3L engine to me wasnt worth the added cost. The 2.7L has more than enough power, and with the AWD and autoshift, it is excellent in the snow. I have averaged on the highway anywhere from 18 to almost 24mpg. For a vehicle this size I feel it is pretty good. The newer models claim to get 28.   Some reviews have said the cabin noise is loud with the windows down. I think most cars at 70mph with the windows down have a lot of cabin noise. Adding air deflectors / vent visors around the windows helps keep the air noise to a minimum when the windows are open.   Financing all those add on items over time adds up. When you buy a vehicle you are paying a ton in interest for the mud flaps, fog lights, cargo cover, etc. being somewhat handy, I buy the aftermarket items as I can afford them, or get them on e-bay at a reduced price. As far as resale, after five years its a moot point after that, and if you plan on keeping a vehicle 7 to 10 years, who really cares about resale?   At 26,000 miles, I have had no major problems, and have not been back to the dealer for any repairs. Changing the oil, filters, rotating tires at regular intervals for any vehicle, along with regular maintenance is key to longevity of any vehicle.   If youre looking for more power, heavy towing, or going from 0 to 60 in 30 seconds, this isnt the vehicle for you. The Santa Fe is a great all around vehicle, quiet, comfortable, elegant and has plenty of storage, with the seats down it is more than adequate. It handles bad weather like a walk in the park.   Hyundai is underrated, and is a very versatile all-around vehicle. This SUV is very capable of handling rough, gravel, dirt, muddy and off the beaten path roads. It will hold your camping gear, skis, golf clubs, kids, soccer gear, and is able to tow your ski doodles, motorcycles or trailerable items such as moving furniture for your kids.   If you are looking to cross over 12 streams, boulders, tow a 40 foot Chris Craft, and drive across the Appalachian Trail, go purchase a Jeep or adequately equipped pickup. Or if you want to be gone in 60 seconds the minute the light changes green why are you looking at a Santa Fe? ",,"Driver right side armrest, valet key for parking."

4,The Begining,D ,01/28/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I just purchased this (New) 2009 Hyundai, Santa Fe and thought I would rate it now, six months and then at the one year mark. I hope you will find it useful in selecting your next vehicle. I am not in any way associated with Hyundai, and no one in my family works for or has any association with Hyundai Inc. I know the site says dont write about the purchasing, but that was one of the reasons why I selected this vehicle over its competitions. It's value and warrantee were huge draws. I actually selected my new SUV from the inventory online and set the price before I even went to the dealership. Even Taxes, Tags, Titling, Destination costs, everything! I said Ill pay this they said ""OK"".","I have set all of my markers at 7 out of 10 because I figured I will adjust up and down from there at the six month and one year mark. That way you will get a good idea, over time, how I really feel about the SUV. Right now, it's above average in Every area, hence the 7's!","Honestly, right now I have no suggestions on how to improve this vehicle, although that could change over time. According to the NHTSA it has a five star crash rating all around. I just hope I never have to test those ratings. See you in July at the six month mark!"

4.5,Bang for Your Buck,cj8drummer ,01/25/2010,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,3,4,Very happy with vehicle overall. I think Hyundai is offering a lot of upscale features for a reasonable price. I have three kids that are hard on a car. The leather is definitely a winner and the interior feels nice. I opted to pass on the third row which at times I'm sure I'll miss but I really didn't want to give up the storage space that you lose when adding the third row. ,"IPod connection and stereo, kids like the fact that the back seat has the option to recline a good bit so that they can rest on a longer drive. ",mileage is not as advertised at this point. Been getting less than 17 mpg mixed city/hwy and that's with gentle driving. The gauge is telling me to refuel after only 250 miles!

Got a terrific end of year deal too. Almost bought a GLS. Very happy I did not. The GLS is underpowered, plus the SE has all the looks of the Limited minus leather for a couple thousand less. I have one major peeve and a couple minor peeves. The major peeve is no daytime running lamps. For a 2009 vehicle, this is a must have safety feature. Minor peeves are Hyundai should give drivers control over the sensitivity of the automatic headlights sensor, and headroom is cramped if you opt for a sunroof.","Quiet, comfortable drive.

My wife is short so driving position and comfort were VERY important for her.  Looked at ALL the competition.  Came down to a used Toyota Highlander or new Santa Fe for about the same cost.  Honestly, we liked the Highlanders better, but the Santa Fe was the best value, had less road noise, and had many features the Toyota didn't, including a long warranty.  Just got back from an 1100 mile family trip (4 of us).  Great ride, but disappointed with gas mileage.  Only getting about 19.5 on the highway.  But if the Electronic Stability Control was turned off, got about 22 mpg.  This has to be fixed!","Driver position for both my short wife and myself, quiet, performance with 3.3L, stereo system with USB and Aux input, clean interior & dash design, ease of installing trailer hitch & wiring, standard tow pkg, 3500lb tow cap.",Arm rests on front seats!

I was looking for a commuter car to take me from my North New Jersey home to my NYC office each day.  150,000 miles later and very little maintenance I decided to purchase another Santa Fe.

I have wanted to upgrade from the Corolla to an SUV for about two years now.  I test drove virtually every new compact and midsize SUV on the market today during that time.  I used to never think I would own a Hyundai, but after a test drive of the new Genesis coupe during a promotion in June, I decided to look at the Santa Fe and am glad I did!  I love the power and performance, but my favorite feature has to be the upgrade in space over the Corolla.  Hyundai has definitely won me over because the value cannot be beat! Drive one and experience for yourself!","The large interior, bluetooth, and warranty.","For the most part the interior is well constructed, but I wish the interior door handles were not so flimsy.

The over-all value we felt we received with this vehicle meets our expectations. The 3rd row seating with the DVD player entertainment system is a BIG plus!  The vehicle handles well, and has decent pick-up.  I am slightly disappointed with the 1st of 5 gears;  It feels like it hesitates a little from a stand-still.  The ""Range"" feature of the trip computer is misleading- When I think I am about to run out of gas, and when I fill-up, I only put in 16.8 gal, not the 19.8 it holds!

2.875,"2.7 + 5 spd manual, a mistake",whoops ,09/11/2009,,,4,3,4,3,,1,4,3,1," Purchased the 2.7 with 5 speed manual. This power train combination is very disappointing and should be avoided. Recommended shift points are at 15 mph. 25 mph. 35 mph. and 45mph (each of these coincide with very close to 3,000 rpm).  Slower-than- expected acceleration from a stop is unnerving, with over-anxious drivers behind you. After 1200 mile break-in (not traveling above 55 mph)the drivetrain mismatch becomes evident, as you can only reach and maintain 65 mph by sustaining 3,000 rpm or higher in 5th gear! Slight hills challenge you to maintain speed, even with no load. I believe this car fails to meet the minimum performance requirements for safe driving on U.S. interstate highways. ",Cabin very roomy.  Fit and finish very good.,"Reconfigure or discontinue the 2.7 ltr. / 5 spd manual drive train.

4.875,Its New and Fun!,Jerry P. ,08/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After 6 months of research on SUV's, I chose the Santa Fe for it's style, performance, price, warranty program, leg and head room (I'm 6'-4"").  No sunroof addition which allows 5 extra inches of head space.  The AWD is very responsive and the 3.3L, 6cyl is well worth the upgrade.",The privacy window tint is not too dark and is beneficial for warmer days.  The MP3 CD player and the iPod connection is a real plus.  Plenty of hidden cargo space.,"Better gas mileage.  The roof rack should be optional and not standard for all 09 models... Some wind noise, even when the crossbars are moved to the rear position."
4.5,2009 Santa Fe GLS 6cyl 4AT,jeanneshyundai ,08/01/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,3,5,5,"I purchased a new Hyundai in July due to the Cash for Clunkers program. I had a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee, that I have loved, but it was getting ready to hit 200K. I drove several different models from the Kia Sportage, to the Toyota RAV4, Chevrolet Equinox, and the Santa Fe. On my second fillup I got 24 mpg-unbelievable!The inside is well designed except for the seats are not comfortable; driver's side. They are very stiff and not nearly as comfortable as the Jeep or other American cars. Please include fog lights as standard on this vehicle. The paint job is beautiful and I am thrilled about the warranty! Love the sound system and I usually put custom sound systems in the car after purchase.","Love the XM radio and IPod, the Ipod connection is what sold me on the Santa Fe. Love the lighting on the dials, so easy to see in dusk/dawn conditions. Engine is so quiet and do love the 'shiftronic' from 1st gear to 4th to give you that manual transmission feel. love the lighter interior options.","Work on the seating for comfort! Add a display with outside temperature, direction, miles to empty, avg. mpg etc.. just like the Jeep, everyone loves this feature!  Have the back seat cushions lift for a flatter fold- down option. Add heated side mirrors standard.Make standard Ipod cable and fog ligh"
3.625,Mobility Program,Adrianne ,07/30/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,1,4,"I bought the truck so that my 82 year- old cancer-patient Mother could get in and out with ease. I like the truck okay, but I take issue with Hyundai's Mobility Program, or rather, the lack thereof. All of the add-ons I needed to assist my Mother were considered ""accessories"" and Hyundai refuses to pay for them. I wasn't asking for anything extraordinary; a trailer hitch so I can use my wheelchair lift and running boards to steady her while she gets in. Neither one is covered. Smoke and Mirrors and absolutely no substance. Shame on Hyundai.",The wide cargo area has ample room to haul things.,Revamp the Mobility Program so that it actually helps those who need it.
4.875,Great buy,Manny ,07/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just purchased a 2009 Limited AWD Santa Fe, and I am so glad I did. It looks and drives like a luxury SUV. It really has all possible safety features available today, and feels secure.  I would recommend any of the new Hyundai because of the huge improvements done in these recent years.",Ventilation on B pillar for second row seats.,Please bring the Turbo Diesel to the US!
4.875,John and Carolyn,John Richards ,07/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,My wife fell in love with the Santa Fe a year ago.She never showed much interest in the many cards that we owned including Cadillacs and a Lexus (es 330 2004) The Santa Fe is as quiet as the Lexus. We love everything about the car. It is comfortable and extremely well made. I added molding to the side which added to the look. We had spoken to many Santa Fe owners and everyone said they love it. No one had any negative comments,"Comfort,driving position,spacious interior, xm radio, quality and the great visibility in the front sides and especially the rear",Power passenger seat would be nice and  more color choices including leather
4.75,New 2009 Santa Fe,Mikie ,07/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Just purchased my Santa Fe July 15,2009.  I purchased the GLS w/Auto trans and only 3 options.  Floor mats,mud guards and cargo net.  You get a lot of standard features with the base GLS. Msrp $24,300, Cash for Clunkers $4500, $2000 rebate, Purchase price $17,399 out the door.  ","XM radio built in, plenty of power with 2.7 V6, quiet ride, fit and finish, great visability.  Good radio !!  I don't know why people are complaining about the radio? Its just fine.","Seats are a little hard, but not too bad.  Engine a little noisy"
4.75,"Santa Fe, go's to the mountains",blizzard ,07/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"A little under powered, slight hesitation entering the high way.  for the most part Gas mileage is as posted on the  window sticker a littler better on the highway.

4.75,2009 Santa Fe Limited AWD,MassHyundaiBuyer ,06/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Did a lot of research on-line through CR and Edmunds.  We have three kids and wanted something sporty with a third row seat.  We also did not want a mega SUV with poor gas mileage.  In doing the research, the choice was obvious.  The Santa Fe has excellent ratings and the price is thousands less than comparable vehicles.  We now had the car for one week and we love it.  The third row has plenty of room and can split, to maintain storage.  The engine is quiet and the ride is smooth. The car has a nice high view of the road. We use to have a station wagon, and we thought we might be losing some cargo space.  This was not the case.  There is plenty of cargo space and the car is not overly long.",Kids love the DVD player.  I like the feeling of being high up.  The rear door opens very easily and the third row seat has adequate space for a midsize SUV.,Would have liked slightly better gas mileage. We are getting about 17 city and 21 highway.
4.875,Nice car with more bang for the buck ,skipperl ,06/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Well, replaced my 2001 Ford explorer Sport and this thing rocks.  It has so many features it's ridiculous.  A ton room and storage areas, extra 12vdc plugs in various locations, the stereo is great once the equalizer is tuned up, the USB port works great with a normal usb cable.  It's quiet, fast and the ride is very smooth with the 3.3 L.  The blue lights are just like my VW dash, nice. The interior is really upscale, very comfortable.  The back seats have plenty of room and the recline with a nice little arm rest back there too.  Rear cargo space is more than my Ford and the under mat storage in great to have. Sharp body design. You can't get a SUV for this $ with all these features.","Interior, overall look, ride, cargo space, warranty and price.",OK what it don't have that I'm use to.  Keypad entry system and a rear window that opens.  It could use some door guards to keep damage down from people swinging their doors into your car. Wish the roof racks moved further apart from front to rear to accommodate large items like my canoe for example
4.5,Best car and best price,FordPLG ,06/14/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,3,5,"Best car in the class, especially the very nice interior, and the very rich standard features. Beautiful style.

4.875,so far so good,MAZZ1 ,06/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Bought my 09 Santa Fe new. The ride is comfortable and smooth. Handling is secure. Fit and finish is very Nice. Only thing I don't like is that acceleration is sluggish.,"Layout of controls are great, easy to read. Love the blue accent interior lighting. Back seats ""recline"" Nice touch for long rides.","Better ""pick up"" from stop, too much drag time between gears. Since it sits on 18"" wheels make sure it fits in garage without hitting roof mounted antennae."
4.625,Nice mid-sized SUV,mikec ,06/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"We replaced my wife's 2002 Mazda Tribute with this after a great deal of research.  Love the quality and build. Very comfortable; rides like a car not a truck.  The Premium sound system in the Limited is among the best I've ever heard (and I drive Lexus) Satellite Radio is nice extra that's standard.  What sold us, too, was the outstanding warranty.  V6 engine is quite sufficient for this vehicle and auto trans is smooth.  Overall, very pleased with this purchase and the $2000 incentive from Hyundai made the purchase of this cost about as much as the Tribute did 7 years ago!  ","Satellite Radio, Leather seats, Lighted cupholders, Outstanding 10- speaker, 600-watt premium sound system in the Limited.","Cargo net should attach over the cargo tray, not underneath it.  Other than that, nothing yet."
4.75,so far so good,mazz1 ,06/03/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,5,5,"I purchased this Santa Fe new in March of 2009. I have had it for 3 months. The ride is smooth, the interior is well laid out, seats are comfortable. The only complaint I have is the acceleration from a stop is slow, seems like it drags, between first and second gear. Also, I have a rattle in the passenger rear and the dealer can't locate it, makes me a little crazy. I am getting on average 20.5 mpg. If you want a Nice suv for a good price check this one out.","the outside look is very sharp, nice clean sleek lines, and the color - slate blue is beautiful...","Outside anntena on roof, should be in the back window, hits my garage door top everytime I enter or exit"
4.625,09 Santa FE,marksj ,05/18/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,Great feel on the road. Drivers seat is very comfortable. Has several adjustments to make it feel that way. Very quiet inside the car. You cannot even hear the engine run. Seat cloth seems durable and feels good.,Audio controls on the steering wheel. Usb jack and audio jack for the cd/radio player. Compartment in back that opens up and has separate compartments inside.,Haven't had long enough yet.We got 23 mpg on first tank of gas.
