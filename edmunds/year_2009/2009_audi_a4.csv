I was extremely happy with the car - especially the acceleration and road handling. The first week of August 2016, with 47,000 miles on the car - the check engine light goes on and some unholy sounds begin emitting from the engine block. After two mechanics, I was directed to bring the car back to the dealer. After a day and a half, the verdict - motor and turbo are done. The dealer informed me that the motor/turbo parts were a mere $14,000! If I wanted to trade the car in, they would give me $500. Currently, the car is in a mechanic's shop in Brooklyn - it looks like the repairs, parts, labor will be around $11,000. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I had a Toyota Camry for 15 years and never once had to make a repair of that cost and magnitude. Or maybe I would be better off with a Hyundai.",,

5,Audi stands behind their Product!!! Forever a Fan!,Annie ,05/22/2016,5,4,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,"Audi has my loyalty as a solid and ethical car company!  And Boulder Audi (formerly Stammler) is the most amazing dealership I have ever encountered.  First, my Audi A4 Avant wagon was my FAVORITE car ever..however, at 62,000 miles I was experiencing excessive oil consumption.  I brought my car to the service department, and they replaced my engine at no cost to me.  Unfortunately, and just over  20,000 miles later, I experienced a second engine failure, stranded in Flagstaff AZ on a road trip.   I contacted Audi of America and the original dealership in Boulder where I bought the car.   I also contacted Michael, my sales advisor at Boulder Audi/Stammler where I originally purchased the car.  He was entirely sympathetic, helpful, and professional and forwarded my case to the Regional Rep for Audi.   I doubted, however, that I would get any assistance from Audi, but I was only hoping that maybe they would stand behind their product.  I am delighted to report that Audi America has agreed to replace my second engine at no cost to me after I presented my cars service history to them.  It is surprising when a large company actually steps up and does the honorable thing.   I am amazed but so encouraged by their business ethics!  Audi/Volkswagen Porsche have my total loyalty in the way this was handled, and how they stand behind their product.   I have always loved the way the car handled, but now, more importantly, I am so impressed by the business ethics of the company who stands behind their product.",,

I'm going to be trading the Audi in soon for another BMW and be done with this car. I jumped in this car without doing my research and paid for it.

1,Save some money and buy a Jetta,Justin ,10/13/2015,1,2,4,,,1,,3,3,,,"I have owned more cars than I can count. The Audi A4 was hands down the worst car I have ever owned. I bought the car with 40,000 miles on it. It was beautiful and drove great. As the 60,000 mile mark started to tick on the odometer, it started to fall apart. Every 1,000 miles the oil light would come on. I would take it in and the dealer said ""add a quart of oil!"" Thank you but is my car burning that much oil that I need to add a quart every 1000 miles or less? They offered to replace the turbos that ""might"" be the problem... Then the transmission problems started in. A very loud ""clunk"" every time you hit the gas pedal from a stop. Back to the dealer, ""past the warranty, 7,000$, sorry, dont know what to tell you.""  Apparently the transmission slips into neutral when you stop and then clunks into  ""gear"" (CVT transmission)  when you hit the gas. It sounded and felt like the transmission was falling out everytime you stopped at a stop sign. It was embarrassing. It had to be driven like a manual and ease it in. Then the interior rattles started. It sounded like something was loose in the doors, every door. The kicker was when I started dating a girl that drove a 1 year newer Jetta. It was THE EXACT SAME CAR with the same features for way less money. She opted for the manual transmission so no tranny problems for her.The good things about the car is that it has comfortable seats and the interior design is comfortable, although, coating on the plastic will start peeling off so your interior will look 10 years old after 5 years.I had enough and traded it in. After 2 years of ownership I realized I could have bought a new car for cash with all the repairs and losses. The first thing the dealer asked when I traded it in and before he looked at the car was ""Let me guess, Tranny or electrical?"" Sums it up right there...",,

It really has made the car not worth it in the least. Additionally, the first Audi dealership I went to, had the worst service I have ever experienced. STAY AWAY FROM AUDI OF WESTWOOD MASS!

They lied to my Wife and I saying there is no problem with the oil consumption.
They later said it was a known problem but since I was leasing that I should just let it go. Every month to oil light comes on beeping eveytime you start the car. So that means i have been into the service department over 35 times in 2.75 yrs. Stupid!
Transmission breaks and accelerator all suck!!
Car takes about 2 seconds to realize that you took your foot off the break and you are already pressing on the gas. Then it lurches forward like you just dropped the clutch (remember its an Auto). So over time you get used to letting off and slowly pressing the gas, meanwhile tons of people honk ","at you thinking your not going.

Haven't had any unscheduled dealer visits. I would definitely recommend the car to someone looking for a 3 series alternative. The A4 is way more affordable and offers the same level of confort at a higher value. The car needs to be serviced at 5k, 15k and 25k. I added 1 qt of oil at 21500 miles which I consider normal given the interval within services.","LED lights. Overall dimensions of the vehicle. Subtle luxury and understated refinement, like old school germans intended it to be. Gas mileage is awesome, unreal: 30 mpg on the highway! I loved the car at first sight and the love keeps growing.

I don't keep my cars past manufacturer's warranty and this one won't be the excemption. From reading other reviews, I feel hesitant to drive this one past 50k miles although I've had a pleasant experience.
","Dealership service is not anywhere close to that of Lexus so I'm glad I'm not there often. Price of the scheduled 15k mile service is over $300 for a glorified oil change. Come on Audi!

4.5,Loving this car!,RMW ,05/21/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"The new A4 is a terrific car.  It's beautifully styled inside and out.  It is comfortable to drive on long trips yet sporty and fun enough to drive fast on twisty roads.  A lot of reviewers complain about the 4-cylinder engine and its buzz, but I love the sound of a turbo 4.  I wish they had put the GTIs sound amplifier in the A4, but can understand why they didn't considering the different demographics.  The main problem I have with the car is that it gets expensive when you start adding features other luxury car manufacturers include as standard.  At an MSRP of $38K, the Premium Plus trim doesn't seem like a bargain against the 328XI, especially since the BMW has standard maintenance.","Interior/Exterior, Engine, Handling, Fun to Drive, Comfort.","Some complex and annoying controls.  The fact that I couldn't find the sports package on any trim but the Prestige. The fact that even though the bluetooth and iPod adapter are listed as optional I couldn't find a model without them. Nice features to have, but would rather have the $1K in my pocket."

Audi was totaled but performed great, did not walk away, but ""only"" have a badly broken foot.  Purchased new in spring of '09 versus a cpo a4 or BMW 3 series.  The new 09 a4 was such a huge change and looked so good it was worth the extra $100/month to me.  Wanted a standard 6 speed trans. But was strong armed into the auto/tiptronic.  The quattro system is awesome, the 2.0 turbo had plenty of power and I averaged 30 mpg in mostly highway driving over 12k miles  before it was totaled.  Would reconsider with a manual trans. And clear-bra. ","Styling, LED/HID Headlights, Quattro drive and perfect firm but not too harsh suspension.  The safety rating is no joke.

It's ""fun enough"" to drive, looks good, and gets great fuel economy considering its size and performance.  I've been a long-time VW and Audi owner and I really do think they offer a great trade-off between value and fun.  However, this '09 A4 is similar to my past VWs and Audis as it still has a number of small (typical Audi) quality issues.  This '09 A4 has suffered from an ignition switch failure, reverse backing light bulb installation issue, broken rear seat cup holder, and came with a defective exterior trim piece.  None of these issues have been major but give me my usual uneasy feeling about owning this car for the long-term. ",The general lay-out and design of the interior is great.  The ipod interface is also pretty solid.  I've gotten used to the oil level sensor and now like it.,"At certain engine speeds & accel pedal position, engine torque oscillates a bit.  The MMI system could include a few short-cuts (e.g., return to previous channel).  The rear exterior lamps simply use push-in bulbs (no turn lock) -- which seems quite cheap.

The S2000 was much more fun to drive, but the added convenience of a full sized trunk, and back seat in the Audi, plus the fun to drive factor, have it beat.

Night and day. While I could never get quite comfortable in my Premium Plus I was immediately very comfortable and have been for the past 16,000 miles in my Sport package model.

I am getting over 33 miles per gallon on the highway and around 28 in the city/suburbs. I am very happy with the vehicle.  I loved my 2002; but, this is a big improvement.

The AWD is the best, especially in heavy, slushy snow. The only complaint is that the wind buffets incessantly my face when the window is open. Poor wind engineering.

The A4 has been back to the dealer twice in 3 weeks.  The first time was due to wind noise and a water leak in the space between the front and rear driver's window.  That was fixed.  The second trip was because the automatic transmission (CVT) feels like it shifts from 1st to overdrive within about 2 seconds, causing significant loss of power.  This even happens in sport mode.

My favorite feature has to be the MMI.  I had this car for almost 3 months and it has been excellent ever since except for a few strange rattle noises coming from the doors.

I decided to purchase the A4 based on the features and price.  The A4 has the quattro AWD, fold down rear seats, 14 speaker Bang and Olufsen system, bluetooth and navigation.  I felt that the exterior styling and the better interior features of the A4 outweighed the engine performance of the 335i.  The Lexus rear bumper styling just didn't grow on me. So far after driving the car for the first 1000 miles I am so happy about my decision.  The A4 is fast off the line and pulling on the freeway in sports mode, the handling is great with the quattro, and it's very eye catching with the LED driving lights.","Bluetooth works great with integration with your contacts.

It is truly an incredible vehicle, with the perfect combination of all the options I was looking for.

What could be better - more horsepower (?), ride over bumps could be a bit smoother (but then you'd lose the sports car feel). Just a great car! ","Lights, stereo, transmission, Bluetooth, intuitive to drive, quickness, looks of car, FUN!",Speedometer - be realistic of top end! Would be nice to have back up camera without having to purchase navigation (will buy Tom-Tom or Garvin with back up camera instead).

5,A4 with Sport Package,Craig ,02/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got the A4 with Premium Plus, Nav and the Sport Package in Quartz Grey four months ago. The styling of the A5 caught my attention and when Audi applied it to the A4, it when to the top of my list. Beautiful interior with Aluminum Trim (not cheap plastic like my Chrysler) with plenty of leg room all around and the layout is excellent. The Engine has plenty of power and the brakes are amazing. The ride is a little stiff with the Sport Package and 18"" low-profile summer tires, but it tracks around corners fast and flat. Sport seats hold you in place and are comfortable on long trips. Safest car I've ever owned. Thanks to Edmunds for supplying loads of info towards my purchase.  ","No. 1 is styling. Paddle shifters, AWD handling, LED running lights that turn heads, Xenon headlights and the stereo are great. Light steering at low speeds.","Loud noise with the sunroof open and all the windows up, but stops if you open any window a little bit. I have a similar problem with my wife's Pilot. Maybe Audi could add a vent in back that opens with the sunroof. The brake pedal seems too close to the gas pedal or maybe my foot is just too wide. "

Furthermore, you would think for a car that burns so much oil, it would come with a dipstick, but, it does not. I wish I would have researched problems like this before buying.

The Infiniti G37X was a little too small and too stiff and the 328xi a little too expensive.  The A4 was just right.  It handles well and accelerates nicely with the turbo 4.  I don't think the V6 adds much more.  It holds 4 people comfortably.  I wouldn't go for 5 unless 3 are very small.  The trunk is huge.  The interior is handsome and the sound system is fine.

The Audi MMI can be challenging at 1st, but once you get the hang of it is very easy to use.

I test drove numerous vehicles before purchasing the Audi A4 including the Lexus IS250, BMW 328xi, Mercedes-Benz C300 4MATIC, and the Acura TL. The A4 was the best vehicle hands down. The handling of this vehicle on wet and dry roads is excellent. I feel like I'm riding on rails even in the snow. The interior is beautiful and made with high quality materials. Every button and every dial feels great to the touch. The back seat has enough room for even your biggest family members. The trunk is enormous for a 4-door sedan.  This vehicle is extremely quick for a 4-cylinder turbo. The back-up camera is unlike any other you've ever seen!  LED lights turn heads!  ","The Bang & Olufsen sound system is the best sound system I've ever heard in a vehicle!  Bluetooth, Navigation, Back- up camera, LED daytime running lights, 18"" wheels and ipod integration are also very cool.","If you have the light switch turned to auto and it's daylight (xenon lights off), and you use your signals, the LED lights on the signal side turn off.

The handling is unbelievable, combined with a truly solid ride and plenty of power. I was concerned at first whether the car would have sufficient power for my lead foot, but it certainly does, especially in sport mode. You just need to punch it -- with a turbo, one needs to use more pedal than with a non-turbo 6 cyl. The gadgets are wonderful: Nav, bluetooth, Sirius radio, backup parking beeper and camera. The Bang & Olufsen sound system is fabulous, worth the extra.  I took the car on a 3000 mile trip.  One barely notices getting to high speed, very solid, esp. with dynamic mode. Radar detector needed!","Drive Select-distinct softening in comfort mode, nice for town.  Dynamic really tightens up the handling.

For a V4 turbo, it delivers a consistent torque through the RPM range making it a pure joy to drive coupled with the excellent all- time quattro AWD. The interior is Audi at it's best with an excellent MMI system - for all intents and purposes is the same interior of the more expensive A6/Q7 models.

5,"Sporty, Comfortable & Solid!",golfgal ,09/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I had been researching the '09 A4 since March 08 -  I ordered it in July and picked it up 2 weeks ago. The car is everything I'd hoped for. It is beautifully redesigned with a sportier & elegant lines. The headlights are making heads turn on the road!! The trunk is spacious; interior is luxurious and roomy. I debated on waiting for the 6-speed manual, but decided to go with the 6-speed tiptronic. The response is quick with a very smooth shifting; excellent acceleration. I have the premium plus package with navigation/back up camera option. There are abundant features included in the premium plus package; I also added the navigation package which included the MMI.","MMI: I love the interface which controls the bluetooth, iPod (Audi Music Interface), navigation and audio selections. Best part is I don't even have to take my phone out of my bag. It picks up the contacts in my Blackberry so I can dial right from the MMI!",None to think of right now.

4.875,So far,scott ,09/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I wish this car had better MPG. That's my only complaint so far. It's competitive with others, but I'm finding closer to 26/27 on the highway versus 30/31 as dealerships tend to suggest you'll get, rather than the numbers listed on the window. Then again, who trusts car dealerships. I find the front seat very very comfortable and since I do a lot of highway driving, this is a big plus.",,Better MPG would be great. And a slightly larger fuel tank as well so less fill-ups.

4.875,Awesome A4!,Frank ,09/25/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,5,5,"Of course my car is new and I'm so happy and exited about my choice; but I did test all AWD cars in that segment, then chose A4 for the style, size (bmw too small), quality of the interior, ultimate sound system. Handling, fun to drive is great! Performance is more than enough for me, but lack brute force of G35x or BMW335xi. This is the only item for which the A4 is not getting perfect score across the board. B&O sound system is a marvel! Way superior than previous Bose option. And with the SD card support, I even don't need to use CD (6 disk changer, MP3 support).  It comes with ipod integration, I'm expecting the ipod cable delivery soon and will provide feedback on it. ","Fuel economy for a 6cyl, it's great! Handling in corners. Sound system.",Add some more horsepower to get 0-60 sub 6 sec.

5,Best all around,Andreas ,09/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The new A4 is an all around excellent auto. It surpasses all others in its class and then some. Wheelbase is similar to the MBenz E-class. Style is literally a jaw dropper. Acceleration 0-60 is better than my 225hp TT which was 6.3 sec. Im guessing the A4 3.2 quattro is similar to the A5 3.2 rating of 5.8sec 0-60, not the 6.3 posted on the Audi website. The exhaust sound is deep and throaty. Braking is quick with minimal nose dive. The best feature is the steering feel. It's very light and nimble. Interior and exterior finish quality is top notch. I test drove this car at Infineon raceway a few months ago and couldn't wait for its arrival. A well equipped A4 3.2 quattro for $40k, what a deal!",The A4 3.2 quattro is fully loaded and well worth the extra $4k. Seats are heated and/or cooled. The LED daytime driving lights are a big attention grabber. The best feature is the steering response.,"The 3-series posts a faster 0-60, but when I compared BMW-3, MBZ-C and LexusIS (all wheel drive) at Infineon none of them come close. The C-class was the worst in handling, while the A4 is a clear winner."

5,Amazing Car,Simon0809 ,09/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This by far has been the best experience in any of the cars I have driven. The car has a lot of speed for a 4 cyl and also it has a sport gear. The interior is really comfortable, and I so far have not had any blind spots! Could not ask for more in a car! ","Sunroof is neat, I love the headlights, and the heated seats will look forward to when winter comes around! The radio is also very impressive. ","I don't believe this car needs any improvements, I love it the way it is!"

4.875,A4 Sedan with Prestige Package,anchor5072 ,09/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Purchased two days ago and drove over the weekend. Car is beautiful inside and out.  Handles like a dream. Very comfortable. Virtually all functions are automated. Using the MMI takes some work, but once you get the hang of the info entry process, it works for most of the different functions.  Several reviews stated that someone shorter than 5'4"" might have some problems with the driver's seat position. My wife is 5'2"" and had no problem getting into a comfortable driving position. Back seat has enough room and the trunk is large for this class of car. I would recommend test driving the 2.0T, as is performs quite well.  ",Front seat comfort. Acceleration with the 2.0T is good (for a normal driver anyway). Steering is sharp on hard corners. Lots of gadgets. LED lights are a new wrinkle.  Sirus radio and IPOD interface add options for entertainment. Bang and Olfusen stereo systems is well done.,"Nothing at the moment, but will update as we get used to the car."
