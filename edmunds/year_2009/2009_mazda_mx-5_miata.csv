5,MX-5 Happy,Canadian Car ,08/23/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my second MX-5. I had a 2002 and traded it in in 2006 for a BMW 3 series sedan. I missed it so much, I bought a black Sport with PRHT.  I love this car and can't get into it without smiling. It is fun to drive and to cruise the back roads as well as a daily commuter. The greatest improvements since 2002 is that this feels faster, less noisy with the top down and I do not miss having to put on that vinyl roof cover. It still drives like a go kart and handles like a dream. I took it to Stowe Vermont and it was great going through the Mountains with my 6 speed.   To misquote Jeremy Clarkson, ""The reason I gave this car 10 stars is because i could not give it fourteen.""","The PRHT keeps the noise level down and adds added protection/safety. The cloth seats don't burn your legs in Summer. The 6 speed is great and gives the full sports car experience. The price. Not the top speed of the Boxster, but this is half the price. Besides I can't use that speed anywhere.",The stock GS Bose stereo is a little meek and can use some more power and another speaker. The GT may be better.  Move the Gas Cap opener switch somewhere else.  Keep the car small and light. No bigger.

4.5,Poor Bose radio,Bob Valentine ,08/19/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,3,4,5,I have had this little gem forever a year now but I am very disappointed with the quality of the Bose radio-- volume has to be tuned up to 24 where other Mazda owners have their radio set at 14 or 15--local dealer says it is normal--I figured with the Bose name on the radio it would be good--not so--can barely hear the radio when top is down--I think the radio is a factory defect but no one wants to admit it--would like a new radio but I don't think it is going to happen as dealer thinks it is a good one,appearance and power hard top,spare tire and different radio

4.875,Duel N Fun,KPD ,07/29/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We have our MX5 8 months and it has been a blast. The little lady fell in love with it. While it's NO Corvette(we have a ZO6, also) in the power dept., it's just fun to zip around in. Just extremely well engineered and designed. However, I don't know why the 6th gear runs at such a high RPM, kills the mpg. And yes another inch or two of leg room would be great (I'm 6'2"") but this is livable. We just love the pwht. When up, it fits the design and when down there's still a trunk. And the shift pattern (6M) is a delight and more fun than our Vette. Well maybe they're equal. We would strongly recommend the MX5 with the power hard top. It's dueling in the fun, top up or down.          ","Without question, the power hard top. The 6M sift pattern is a blast. And we love the overall design inside & out.","Again, a inch or two more leg room for us 6'2"" people. And possibly a more fuel efficient gear ratio in the 6th gear for better mileage."

It even loads my golf clubs in the trunk! The only real complaint I have is that somehow it could have a spare tire. I just feel real uneasy going out of town far without a spare, even though they do give you an air pump and sealit material.  Overall, I definitely recommend this car and would buy one again sometime once i wear this one out, if that is possible.",Every thing!,"Needs a spare tire - maybe a ""doughnut"" under the trunk!

4.5,2009 Miata (Grand Touring w/Power Top),John from Dallas ,11/16/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"This is the first non-Toyota vehicle I have owned since 1985.  I have owned it for about 6 months and it continues to be a pleasure to drive.  I considered a few other cars (Mini Cooper S, Nissan 370Z and the Audi TT).  The Audi and Nissan were about 10 grand more and the Mini dealer was extremely arrogant).  Overall, I chose the Mazda because of the styling, performance and power hard top.  The reliability was also a big sell for me.","Styling, power hard top and overall performance.","More interior room (I am 6 ft 2 inches and it is a little small for me).  A bit more power would be nice -- with the AC on it is a little sluggish.  My biggest complaint is the sun visor -- really, really bad.  Overall it is very small, and you can not move it to block the sun on your driver side."

5,Top Down Fun!,Tony M. ,10/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We bought the car as a weekend fun car and what fun it is!  It is getting colder in the North East now, but I intend to squeeze out every last day of top down driving that I can.  Love the way the engine growls and how it handles overall. Not nearly as much fun with the top up. Would love to take a really long top down drive but alas I may have to wait until next spring to do so.  If you live in a year round warm climate, buy this car!  If you don't no worries, cover it up in the winter and you will enjoy it that much more come spring time. b/t/w I am 6 feet tall with long legs and I don't find the car to be uncomfortable at all.  I truly love my MX-5.        ","The PRHT is so eazy and fast, and I love that it does not take up your trunk space. Manual shift is quick and responsive.  Auto temp control, the red dash lights, overall look (gets alot of attention), love just about every little feature. ",I am a fan of BOSE products but the radio in this car is sub-par.  The sound is great with an I-Pod connection but radio and CDs sound okay at best.

It drives like a dream, it's fun to watch people look at the car and smile, it's fun to take corners at high speed, it's fun to listen to the great stereo with the top down and the wind in your hair while singing at the top of your voice.

Well I went to the dealer and test drove one and wow big improvement over my 2007, tighter suspension, the seats are great, the stereo with MP3, Bluetooth, seat adjuster, my husband fit in it and more, I loved it. My husband has an S2000 and mustang and he loved this car too, it may not be as fast or sporty as his, but then it was not made to compete with those cars in that class, but I find it more fun then his, this car was made for pure fun and enjoyment and that is what it is. I have it now for 3 weeks and that smiley face is now on my face everyday.

4.75,Often misjudged for what it is,dancetracks ,09/04/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Anyone who has driven a Miata will come away with a smile. But often someone will come along and bash the car comparing it to cars costing $10K more (S2000) or twice as much (Boxter). It is unrealistic to expect Porsche performance at the Miata's selling price of around $25k (sport model). The MX-5 really sits by itself in the marketplace of low-price performance convertibles. Drive one. If you come away with a smile, then buy it and let the fun begin. I can't stop thinking about the next time I'll drive the car.","Sporty, great handling, light weight, just enough power to prevent me from getting tickets, great shifter in the 6MT.","More leg room, higher 6th gear for cruising at below 3000 rpm, built-in GPS option."

Hell, why was I not doing this years ago?  Not sure about every convertible out there, but this sure seems like the best damn one out there.

This car invites you to drive it - it is so much at home on a winding road with the top down - it delivers just what the car was designed to do - a oneness with the road and a fun factor that is off scale. The 6 speed transmission is a joy, the audio system sounds great, the top up / down operation is effortless and the car has great visual appeal. Test drive one - you will love it!",The overall fun factor of just driving the car.

4.75,Keeps getting better and better,ZoomZoom ,07/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I drove an '09 on a whim, didn't think I'd buy as I loved my 07 Grand Touring PRHT.  I was wrong.  As soon as I took the test drive I could tell the seemingly minor changes had made a great car even, well, greater.  Red line is up to 7200, so less hitting the rev limiter when winding it out.  Engine and tranny just seem stronger and smoother, although the published numbers are basically unchanged.  6M shifts seem even tighter and shorter if that's possible.  Must have been exhaust tweaks because it sounds even better.  Interior also seems roomier, the door cup holder has been redesigned and no longer protrudes into your leg.  Love that!  Traded my 07 on the spot and drove the 09 home.","Higher redline and overall drivetrain and interior tweaks.  Super reliability based on my 99 and 07 Miatas, never a single problem.  Got Homelink, Bluetooth phone, keyless, and TPM.  Price undercuts base Z4/Boxster by $25K or the Z4 Turbo/Boxster S by 35K. Cash in my pocket.

As my son put it, it feels like you're going fast even when you're not. It's just fun to drive no matter what kind of driving you're doing. My first sports car was an MG Midget, which began to disintegrate as I left the dealership. It was great fun to drive, when it would start and it wasn't raining, but living in Baton Rouge that wasn't often. One thing I know about the Miata is that it doesn't leak. Also, it gets surprisingly good gas mileage for the kind of driving that I do. Loads of fun, and I love the design. I even like the grill changes.","wheels, paddle shift, gas mileage, profile, new grill, soft top, leather seats",I still find the placement of the window switches counterintuitive; they should be on the doors.

I'm an experienced technical review of video gear, so I'm trying to apply those skills here.   The MX-5 is exactly what a fun roadster should be, but was lacking till the introduction of the Miata in 1989.  It holds the road beautifully and has just the right amount of power for what this car is supposed to be - a fun way to travel on a nice day.  The engineering design seems very well thought out and offers opportunity to the experienced driver and user- friendliness and intuitiveness to the new roadster enthusiast. It is an amazing car and I love driving it. ","Handling, performance, general engineering, availability of aftermarket support and car clubs, general curb appeal.","Move power lock buttons forward, change position of reverse gear on 6 speed models (too near low gear), simplify flat tire remedy, better fuel economy, automatic engine compensation if regular gas is used."

Would love if they put a turbo charger on it, but the 4 cyl engine still pulls nicely.  I test drove both the manual and auto 6sp.  I ended up with the automatic because it shifts quickly at near redline when driving spiritedly, and I do more highway driving and did not want the suspension package that was on most of the 6sp manuals.",Road handling characteristics.
