Only maintenance has been routine oil changes and a recall sensor replacement.  No issues have arose as of yet which is comparatively amazing next to the 2 dozen other vehicles I have owned. [non-permissible content removed]  The technology that Nissan loads in these vehicles easily rivals the $100K German Sedans and in case you've never owned one,  you could put 5 transmissions in a Murano for the maintenance costs in the first 150k.  And if you are complaining about the audio system, you should see about a hearing aid.  Bose makes the best car audio systems available, from the factory or in the aftermarket.  You could spend 5 grand on speakers and amps and not come close to the R&D Bose did on the system they through out.  Its not the fastest sports car, its not going to win at BAHA nor will it survive an attempt to triple that group of rail road tracks on the other side of town, [non-permissible content removed],  it is an excellent car for a small family or even a mature 19 year old.  It is easy to drive and can be equipped nearly as well as a BMW or Mercedes, with more room than a sedan and better fuel economy than a Tahoe.  It has just about as much power as can be directed through a transmission with no finite gear ratios in what is primarily a front wheel drive vehicle, and that is plenty for anyone that might find themselves transporting anything that might be difficult to replace.  I was just trying to see how much more life my Murano has at 150k only to find out most of them explode at less than half that.",,

4,Tough damn looking car!,Frank ,04/29/2016,,,,,,,,4,,,,"I bought my 09 LE used with 82,000 miles and unfortunately had to replace the Catalytic Converter right off. Since then it has been a pleasure and I have full confidence in it.  The body styling fits right in despite being a 2009 and is still a very attractive vehicle to look at.  The front seats are most comfortable. I only wish they had the ventilation for the three warm months of summer here in Maine. I love the power folding rear seats. Many SUV's in this class do not have that feature.  One complaint with this car is the CVT transmission.  It is loud and bothersome.  I prefer an automatic shifting engine that you forget is even under the hood. A second complaint is with the A-Pillars that seem to obstruct my front view especially if I am pulling out in to traffic to see if I can continue to go. The front windshield has a long graduated slope to it which creates this issue. My last complaint is that the ride could be smoother. I have the 20 inch tires which I understand create a less smooth feel to the road. I can survive that however as I feel very sure footed when driving. Those three issues are the only complaints I have.  I think this is a car worth considering if looking for a very nice and comfortable used SUV that in many ways is better looking than the same year of the Lexus RX 350.",,

I am not a fan. Here is why:-- Not a comfortable ride. Very stiff and not agile at all. It is like driving a boat. The seats are comfortable but there is something with the suspension. --Doors are very wide. Hard to park in a normal parking spot. -- CVT (Transmission) is wonky. Not responsive and sluggish.-- Acceleration in general is bad. Not responsive.,"Gas mileage is good.

They did replace the CVT (now that they extended the factory warranty to 10yr/120K) but our transfer case was leaking too (as so many of them have) and we were told it couldn't be rebuilt since it was one that had been made with a bad part! What floored me was we got NO help from Nissan at all with the cost of the replacement part. I even contacted the executive offices in TN. $3K later, I still have a metallic rattle when the CVT is trying to kick out of the first ""gear"" and after reading about how many others had the same issue, I am VERY worried I will have to replace both drive train components again if we hang on to the car.",I love the look of the car.,"Nissan needs to back their product. Many BBB complaints and NHTSA complaints too about the drive train failures. Nissan told me they didn't have a ""campaign"" out about the leaky xfer cases since the NHTSA hadn't required them to. (Although many of the people who have had to get CVT replacements also have ""un-related"" transfer case leaks/failures) So, at least no one has died, but until they do, Nissan doesn't care about the quality of the vehicles or the consumers that buy them. A 2009 with under 100K and 2/3 of the drive train fails, ridiculous! The tech stated it was due to a run of bad xfer cases on some VIN's, but Nissan still won't acknowledge the problem and sticks us with the bill!"

Of course, it's gone through 2 batteries but that is due to the fact that my better half never turns off any of the electrical consumers and her regular commute is generally short. ...And like other MO users, we've experienced that strange phenomenon when you have to call the Ghostbusters to scare the electrical gremlins that keep you from starting the car.

5,Great car comfortable,pianotunertech ,02/12/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We had a 05 Murano, it was definitely roomier than our '08.The drivetrain is a little quirky. But it gets up and moves very very quickly.The sound system in this car is the best I've ever heard for stock.It is very balanced and very powerful.The heated seats are wonderful, the ride seems to only improve with time. The seats are very comfortable for long trips with less fatigue than other cars--I like the upright sitting position. This car is very luxurious, leather, the air conditioning seems to work much better than our '05.Maybe it's the silver exterior vs. navy blue both with the black interior, but that 05 was beastly hot and hard to cool down in summer.","The cargo room is still great but less than the 05. The Murano is roomy and comfy. The swept windshield obliterates the roomier feeling front and back, the 05 had a more expansive dash similar to the VW Beetle and more cargo room. But its a better looking car I think than the 05.
The wind noise is nothing though with the better aerodynamics--much better than '05.
The gas mileage does MUCH better on highway than in town.
It's hard not to be more lead footed in a car that pretty much with the Murano CVT creams everything else off the line. Even our Cube beats most for the first few yards!
CVT's have been around. Da Vinci had the concept; they were race outlawed in 1910 onward too good!","Hard to say,
I don't like the lack of visibility looking out as a driver, of this style of ""chopped cars"" with swept windshields and lowered ceilings.
The backup camera helps while backing, but driving along you'd better be good with side mirrors because blind spots abound.
It's livable just be careful.
 The swept windshield makes getting in and out of the driver's seat a little more crunched.
The gas mileage isn't great but for a bigger SUV like car with a lot of room and good cargo space, it's fine.
The performance makes up for that and again, on the highway, things even out pretty well.
The newer Murano moved much more towards its Lexus cousin with its styling and features. "

The 2009 is definitely more refined than my 2005.  However, the 2009 has been riddled with squeaks, creaks and rattles since delivery. It has been off the road for almost a month in total as the dealer has tried to repair it. After replacing almost all plastic pieces in the interior of the vehicle, there is now an issue with how the body panels were assembled at the factory. Nissan is not clear yet how to fix this issue. It likely will involve body work, re- welding the panels and inserting some type of insulation to prevent rubbing during body flex.  Stay tuned. Check other blogs for similar posts",The features are outstanding. I would not have purchased any other vehicle (not knowing the trouble that would come from it).  ,Nissan needs to eliminate the cheap plastic fasteners that are used extensively throughout the vehicle.

This was my first Nissan and for a non-luxury brand, I've been very impressed with the car. The build quality is great and the ride is very smooth. The interior is well crafted and very quiet.

We use this as an everyday commuter vehicle and staying within the speed limits get about 23miles per gallon highway. The Murano does everything well but not great. Its certainly not a luxury suv, sporty or hockey mom suv but it does all those things adequately. While some decry CVT we found it to be one of the Muranos stronger points. We hope Nissan does not add a 3rd seat as there is stil a market place for a true mid-size suv.","Touch screen is very good.

There was an electrical problem with a window that was fixed on my first repair visit. I'd do anything to get out from under this car but it would be too expensive to do.

What sold me: It is super quiet inside, very comfortable (I'm 6'2""), roomy front & back, all the goodies like intelligent key, backup camera, etc. I actually did little research on this vehicle before testing it out but once I drove it, it had my attention.

Just returned from a 2610 mile road trip up the coast of California to Oregon and back home to San Diego with a 2 day stop in Yosemite.

",Bluetooth to eliminate the pain of California's hands free cell phone law.  Superior handling and comfort.  Keyless entry and one touch push button starting.,MPG could be better. Even 5 mpg would be nice. The rear storage area cover is a big pain! Go back to the 2005 door pockets. Get the outside temp reading back on the main info display like it was in 2005.

I read other reviews about the slight bouncy quality on the Murano while driving city streets and am happy to say I experienced this myself when driving the SL but not the LE. This is due to the 20inch tires on the LE I believe. The ride on the LE is posh, luxurious and the car handles and drives very nicely and smoothly. I am excited to pick up the car tomorrow. I compared this to the Acura RDX and MDX, the Audi Q5 and the Volkswagen TIguan and Touareg, but found the Murano to the best in terms of ride comfort and lowest road/wind noise. Very happy buyer.

I have had the Murano for a month and I look for reasons to drive. Comfort, handling and the interior will keep me in this SUV for a while.

While the vehicle has so many great qualities, including a fantastic interior, comfortable seats, and great ergonomics, I wish I had taken a bit more of an extensive test drive in the vehicle I took home. While the vehicle isolates road ""bumps"" my particular example has this sort of undulating bouncy character to it which is especially noticeable on surface streets.  It is smoothed out somewhat at speed on the freeway but is still noticeable.  Anyway, it is a bit annoying to say the least and definitely is detracting from the excitement that should come with a new care.

The second fault is with the dual moon roof which is also on the 09 Maxima equipped with the premium package. With no moon roof wind deflector presently available, this vehicle is, with out a doubt, the noisiest vehicle I have ever owned or had the opportunity to ride in my 60+ years.

The 20"" wheels make the LE the only Murano to buy and everyone comments how great the Murano looks.  The only glitch is the O/D button.  It is in a bad location - it is too easy to bump while turning on the heated seats or reaching into the center console in front of the shifter.","AWD, memory seats, iPod connection and good HVAC.  Excellent use of knobs and large buttons on the dash are nice compared to so many new cars that have micro buttons on their dashboards.",Move the O/D button from the shifter to the dash.  Allow the fog lights to work without the headlights.

It drives great, the technology is equal to that in products twice as expensive, and it is great looking in and out.  I don't see why anyone would pay the premium for an FX35.  The only things I might nitpick on are that all four windows should be one-touch, the steering wheel on a loaded SL should be power, and with all the great stereo technology there should be an iPod connector.  Also, the dual moonroof for its size should slide open further.  Nevertheless, this is the one to put on the top of your list.","Navigation, audio system, engine & transmission, interior design and quality, space, styling.",Small items noted in review.  A tad more power (we know the Nissan 3.5 could do it).
4.75,Leader of the Pack,rogeliorulo ,01/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"My last SUV was the Lexus RX. You must remember it is the last generation Toyota Highlander. The Murano is light years ahead in every way. It is much quieter & smoother, with the best nav interface system on the market today. I loaded up my SL because I didn't need/want AWD. The stereo system is the best. You can record directly from CDs to a 9.3G hard disk. I use the satellite radio with traffic info. Wow. It has saved me untold hours on clogged freeways.  I opted out of the factory 20"" wheels instead buying Michilens and 20"" wheels on the aftermarket - a much better choice. It cost me much less for better equipment. A no brainer.  While the jury is still out on reliability, I am optimistic.",The nav/stereo system. The backup camera actually has guidelines that move as you turn the wheels. Very creative.  The nav system gives me useful options the Lexus doesn't even offer.,MILEAGE. I get around 20 mpg.  Considering the engine is an Infiniti performance oriented V6 I am not surprised. Still we all long for better mileage in todays world.

Well, I could - if it would consume a bit less but one should not expect too much (like those having back and leg problems who probably would not be satisfied in a private jet). After all it is an SUV/crossover and San Francisco is not nice to fuel economy. This is very comfortable car and to be honest I would rather be sitting in plushy seat of my Murano and cruise around than write this review.

I have 2 major complaints.  1.When driving between 1000 & 1500 RPM and going approximately 30-40 MPH, the vehicle makes a sound that sounds like whistling brakes but it is not the brakes.  Upon review by the dealership we were able to duplicate in every model of the 2009 Murano.  This was being turned into the engineers at Nissan to design a fix.  This was discovered in July 2008 and yet to hear resolution. 2.Is the 20"" tires and the fact there is only 1 tire for this model.  Tires have been rotated and maintained and need replaced at 15000 miles.  Horrible in rain/snow & I drive for a living.  Not fair.","Automatic hatch, back up camera, sunroof, iPod connection",Door pocket should pop out. IPod connection should work w/iPhone.

The 2009 Murano has been a huge disappointment. I recently took this vehicle on a 6 hour road trip and I was actually in pain when I arrived at my destination.

5,Best car for the money,The G Family ,12/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great car. Handles very well on the road. Drives and feels very stable, just like the Altima and Maxima. The car is actually fairly wide, and that makes it feel even more stable. Takes a bit of time getting used to it, but it is not a disadvantage. Driver has a lot more visibility on the road thanks to the high seating position inside the car. The engine is very responsive in all situations. Breaks are also responsive without being too touchy. There is plenty of space for a family of 5 inside this vehicle. This model comes well equipped and avoids including many of the useless bells and whistles other SUVs have. The standard options are just what is needed without being pretentious.","Room inside the cabin, the powerful engine, responsive drive, very safe car, the standard options included that give us all we need, the added visibility because of how high the driver can seat inside the car. Rear visibility is not a problem. Best car for the money! Would recommend without regrets!","Have not gotten there quite yet. Perhaps the next Murano should be more fuel efficient? However, we have not driven ours that much to make a fair comparison. Just feel like most cars these days should achieve a standard of at least 30 mpg or higher even inside the city."
3.75,My take so far...,A.B ,12/25/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,3,3,"With 1 child and a second on the way, it seemed time to step up to an suv. Did so reluctantly, but wanted something stylish, functional and price worthy. Checked out the Rav4, RX 350, Acura RDX. The fully loaded Murano LE was the only way to go. Inside the cabin is nice, with a luxury feel. Lots of bells & whistles. The engine & drive is smooth. Very good acceleration for a heavy vehicle. Haven't driven it hard, so hard to describe the handling, but it does feel like it does have some body roll on hard turns & movements. Mileage is avg at best.","Nice interior with good feel qualities about it. Audio system & navigation are very good. Haven't used all of the features, but like what I've used so far. I like the aggressive look of the car & the 20inch tires on the star type rims makes for a nice touch to the car's look. ","Better gas mileage, better rear view access. Blind spots are tough, although the back-up camera helps a bit. One real complaint I have is the turning circle is a lot wider than what I've experienced elsewhere, so there's a bit of front and back going on when going into tight parking spaces. "
4.875,No Compromises,Helen  ,12/23/08 05:37 AM (PST),5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5," I traded in my 2003 Murano.  I absolutely love the 2009 Murano.  I looked at the Toyota Highlander and the Lexus 350LX. The Murano blew the doors off of the Lexus.  All the standard features on the Murano LE were optional features on the Lexus and Toyota.  The fit and finish is much better on the Murano than any other SUV on the market. Nissan really got it right.  The little details are what make me so happy.  Like the back up camera, the keyless ignition, the heated seats, the laptop ports, the automatic liftgate, the 20"" wheels, the large console display, and of course the stereo system. The styling is really fresh too.",The automatic liftgate is the whole reason I purchased the Murano.  The back-up camera and the heated seats are worth every penny.,"I miss having automatic gas and brake pedals like on the 2003 Murano.  I also miss having the door panel storage space.  On the 2003 model, the door panel popped out for easy access."

This has more bang for the buck and is just plain fun to drive.  This interior is awesome, great leather.  For those of you who are complaining that you can't listen to the radio unless the car is running - if you push the Start button twice without putting your foot on the brake, all your accessories will work.  (this from a 60 year old grandmother).  I love the heated seats - kept them on low on a 560 mile drive and my back felt great when I arrived.  I make excuses to drive it!

And at less than two weeks old and with 760 miles on the odometer, I was greeted Thanksgiving day with a car that was totally dead. Nothing worked. The dealer told me that I was not the first owner to have this happen. A power module had to be replaced. I lucked out. My car was in the driveway. The car ran perfect up to that point. I drive 80 miles one way to work and hope that the problem doesn't repeat itself while I am away from home. Let's see how well Nissan repairs it's cars.","When running, this is a fun car to drive.

The ride is quiet and comfortable and the CVT operates great.  Good acceleration and power delivery whenever you need it.  As far as bang for the buck, none of the other cars I considered compares.  The interior is of high quality materials, especially considering the price.  One thing I don't like is the sound system.  It is way too bright though it doesn't seem to be an opinion shared by others.  The dash speakers blare so I had to go an aftermarket route to tone down the higher frequencies.

My lease was up and needed to step into an SUV with good style and better gas mileage. My only logical choice was the Nissan Murano. My problem was that it is much smaller compared to the Pathfinder but boy was I surprised. I love this SUV. Great handling, impressive power, and head turning good looks. I chose the Black on Black colors by the way. My only wish is that the Murano was the size of an Acura MDX. Otherwise it is an excellent vehicle. Oh... bumping up the horsepower to match an Infiniti FX35 would not hurt either. I'm sure car lovers would appreciate the extra power. I know I would.","Styling, leather interior is awesome, Bose stereo system, power liftgate, rear-camera. The Premium and Tech. packages are excellent. Many toys to play with.

The Murano has by far the best styling inside and out. The size was slightly bigger than it appears so it is not quite as nimble as some of the smaller offerings. We did not want either a sunroof or third row seating and this is one vehicle where you don't have to pay for those options and you can actually find in dealer inventory. We recently took it on a 400 mile trip and found it to be extremely quiet and comfortable. It seems to be getting good mileage about what the EPA estimate suggests. All things considered I think of it as a ""poor man's"" Lexus RX 350.","Great engine, powerful and smooth. The CVT is kind of neat and takes a little getting used to.

It easily made it through the mountain climbs and averaged about 15 MPG with the heavy load.  On another trip with no trailer, it averaged about 24 MPG.

This includes the back up camera.  I can back up to my trailer perfectly the first time, every time with the camera - a great convenience.",It could use more space in the rear storage area.

First tank of gas yielded 18 mpg, and I'm currently getting 24-25 mpg (half city/half hwy). Not overly conscious of my driving habits, so a little attention could possibly yield even better mpg.  Just hit my thirties and was time to move on from my sports car-  after a little separation anxiety have never looked back! =D I found the quickness & agility a pleasant surprise over older muranos, and the comfort/mileage/value beat out the Mazda CX-7 & Infiniti FX-35. It's rugged enough to get to construction sites for my job, roomy enough for our two dogs, stylish for a night on the town. Love everything about this car!","Comfort, maneuverability, steering wheel mounted audio controls. Also getting surprisingly good mileage!  Interior styling is beautiful... how the cupholders neatly hide away under a brushed aluminum cover... (as an architect-type, I get amped by the interior fit & finish)","Menu option pricing is a little frustrating. Only one item to be fixed under warranty so far: driver's side seat upholstery bubbling up a bit. Last-- one nitpicky item, a little deeper ledge at the rear bumper, in order to rest boxes til you can get the rear hatch door open, would be awesome."
4.875,Murano is a great crossover!,George in Oregon ,07/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We've had our Murano for about a month.  It's proven to be reliable, offers very good handling, is quite striking in appearance, and has unsurpassed quality.  The keyless ignition took some getting used to!  I haven't quite figured out how to optimize the CVT.  I'm not too sure how far to step on the gas, and how the CVT ""downshifts.""  Other than this, it is a great vehicle.  I strongly endorse this vehicle!","Looks, handling, interior appointments.","Believe it or not, the setting of memory seats with the intelligent key is not very intuitive.  We've been able to set one fob but not the other.  I guess the dealer will need to help."
4.875,Antonio's Review,Antonio1958 ,07/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded two vehicles:  an '03 Murano SL AWD and '05 350Z Roadster after realizing that it is no longer practical for me to have 2 vehicles requiring premium fuel.  I purchased a black on black w/leather LE loaded with the dual panel roof instead of a DVD player. This car is an absolute delight to drive and I'm amazed at the amount of room as well as the creature comforts.  When you press the accelerator, it responds  effortlessly.  20hp more than my '03 and seems like about the same mileage  with mid-grade fuel. If you select a black one, only use microfiber cloths on the exterior and say good-bye to automatic car washers.  ","My favorite features:  everything, from the lighting on the instrument panel and automatic wipers to the Bose entertainment system with iPod capabilities, sat radio and the music box make for endless listening capabilities. And the nav and voice command system.  I have to refer to the owner's manual!","Rear windows that go completely down, turn signals on side view mirrors and/or different placement within instrument panel.  Chrome/aluminum cross rails as an option, looks cheesy with black, especially since chrome/aluminum are on the Rogue!! Chrome exhaust tips are nice, so tuck that muffler."
4.75,Initial Impressions Are... WOW!,Allan ,06/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"We recently bought the LE with dual moon-roofs, after owning a Durango for 9 years.  When looking at prospective cars, 3 things were imperative... driver side room (I am 6'6) with plenty of cargo area (3 dogs and kayaks), dependability and mpg.  I focused on the Murano, CRV, Pilot and Highlander. Based on research and without test driving, I was fairly certain I would be purchasing a CRV or a Highlander.  I ended up test driving the Murano and was sold immediately.  It was the most comfortable, spacious, ergonomic and moderately priced when factoring mpg.  I originally was thinking the SL model would be my choice.  But after driving the LE, I was willing to spend the extra $$$.","Roominess and leg room is perfect for a large driver, the interior is luxurious, the tech features are awesome including iPod interface (clutch!) and an amazing Bose system, rear video camera, power seats and leather are beyond 5 star, bluetooth and the exterior's design is aggressive and unique.  ","I haven't had the car long enough to get a good feel of a consistent mpg. I have a feeling that it isnt going to be as high as I had hoped (22ish). Although this is a very small qualm, I would prefer that Nissan cut down the horsepower slightly and improve the mpg.  But, anything beats the Durango"
3.5,Too many recalls,Beverly ,06/28/2008,,,4,5,3,1,,3,5,4,3,"I fell in love with the 2007 Murano, and when  read about the 2009 I waited 3 months to purchase the new sleek 2009. I even paid full MSRP to get the right color and style I wanted.  But it has been one service visit after another.  2 recalls, 1 for reprogramming the airbags, and 1 for the repairing the clock.  This last visit, there seems to be a air leak that is a known issue in Muranos, but since the car is so new, the parts to replace are not yet being manufactured, so the service department returned my car and asked me to wait for the recall notice to fix. How disappointing. ","Power seat control, heated seat, double moonroof",Make power retractable foot pedals an individual option.

Good pick up. Easy to put down back seats for hauling.  Comfortable ride. Plenty of leg and head room in front and back seat. My first SUV, so a little difficult to judge distance in front and back.  Slight limits on visibility.  I like the 6 CD changer and easy plug in for iPod.  Overall - very pleased with vehicle.  ","Comfortable seats, CD changer, electronic displays, large glove box, cup holders, plenty of storage","It seemed like the options were linked to packages.  I would like to be able to have sun roof without the leather package, etc.  Better visibility."
5,Can't Believe It!!,ManleyMan ,06/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I drove Nissans (Datsuns) in the 1970s then quit - until this year. Totaled my Saturn Aura and got a Murano for short term rental. It is now a long term ownership proposition. This car has it all in looks, handling, ride, quality, and performance. VALUE!! That was the reason I bought the Saturn, but the Murano defines the word (please see dictionary). Had to wait 2 months to get my tinted bronze metallic (the color they use in all the sales ads on TV and print media) but well worth it. Most buyers are looking to drive off the lot and I feel exclusive in my color choice having yet to see another. Marital discord has thus arisen as my wife wants this car BAD!! Love @ 1st drive guaranteed!!","Bose speakers, ride comfort, and handling. Bronze color is awesome! Body styling is head-turning. ",Make AWD standard.
4.875,Top of the Class Crossover,Musky300 ,06/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Spent several months reseraching every other CUV/SUV on the market and the 2009 Murano continually popped up near the top of every criteria list.  I quickly uncovered that this vehicle should not be compared to the Mazda CX- 7, Ford Edge, Toyota Highlander, etc., but rather the Lexus RX, Acura RDX/MDX, BMW X3/X5, etc.  For the money, the performance, amenities, and overall driving experience that Nissan offers in the Murano cannot be beat in its class.  I went with the LE because it offers everything, I would highly recommend the navigation option (no regrets).  After a month of ownership and 2000 miles, I am still impressed by the ride quality and everything that this vehicle offers. ","Smooth and powerful VQ 3.5 V6 and CVT combo (fantastic ride quality).   INtelligent key, nav, Bluetooth, power- everything, and all the other great technology packed in this thing.  Others: Interior layout, comfort features, 20"" wheels, Bose sound system, safety features.  Overall build quality!",Air-conditioned seats would be nice. A-Pillars the C-Pillars are pretty thick which hurts visibility.  Little stiffer suspension (though that may reduce the great ride quality).  Get rid of disable functioning on some of the Nav. features when driving.  Can only think of small picky items! 
4.875,Great SUV,waytogo ,06/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Unbelievable value and more comfortable than my Lexus RX.  Also, there's no shift shock so you pick up speed very quickly.  The rear seats recline and have alot of leg room.  The illumated gauges and the chrome interior finish have a sports car feel.  Go with the front wheel drive version instead of AWD and save money. ","CVT, 265 hp engine, dual moon roof, leather interior and power liftgate.  Numerous standard safety features.",Memory seats and electronic tilt/telescoping steering wheel as an option on the SL.
4.625,Super SUV!,dougmael ,06/10/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I traded a 2007 Toyota Camry SE-V6 for this Murano LE in April and could not be happier!  Great styling, excellent performance, fine handling (for an SUV) and decent fuel economy... what more could I ask for?  OK, I could ask for more, but then I would have to purchase a new FX-50 and spend an extra $15K or more!","Styling (particularly the front-end of the exterior and the entire interior), back-up camera, Bose stereo with iPod conection.","Bigger rear window, moonroof availability as a stand-alone option."
4.625,Nicely Done Nissan,SixFive ,05/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Nice car in black with 20 inch wheels.  Very plush interior and very much not a german built interior, which is good for a change.  We chose this over the loaded FX35 even though within $10 of the payment we have with Murano.   The Murano has a wondefully smooth powertrain with terrific town and highway power thanks to the VQ 3.5.  The immediate availability  of torque via the CVT by pressing the gas at any rpm is very impressive and very uneventful without gear changes.  The car has superb output even on regular gas.  Many 300hp SUVs don't have the grunt of this car.  We just came out of a VW Toaureg.  While not as solid a structure, it does shed about 650 pounds from the ""egg"". ","Rear seat release and return, rearview camera, high end Bose 9 speaker stereo, harddrive space, Gen II CVT, VQ 3.5, leather quality, rear seat room, Dash layout even though very unique, instumentation lighting, wheels.",Better steering ratio could help the car feel sportier as perhaps the previous generation did.  Better cornering with less roll and dive could be obtained with stiffer springs and/or heavier anti-roll bars.  Brakes are a little tough to modulate and could stand better feel.  Weight could be an issue.
5,Automotive engineering at its best,John ,05/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Since 1970, have driven or owned almost every Nissan-Datsun product ever built. The '09 Murano is a first for me and tho experience is yet short, this is probably about as good as any driving experience is ever going to get for present industry standards, period. Relentless comparisons and long time experience keeps me coming back to Nissan. Note some who complain about body roll -- those should realize that Nissan could provide perfectly flat cornering, but then a lot of weak or inexperienced drivers would find out (upside down in the ditch), that tires do not stay permanently glued to the pavement. Some body roll lets you know that you are approaching the adhesion limits of your tires. ","Just a wonderfully well refined and balanced arrangement of looks, power & creature comforts. Spectacularly solid & confidence-inspiring feel on the road. Keyless, push-button start a nice touch. Nissan designers and engineers worked overtime on this fine piece of work. Won't find better!","Better mileage is a no-brainer, but could have bought a Nissan Versa for that"
4.875,Miss my truck but LOVE my Murano,TruckGirl ,05/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Leaving my 2005 Pathfinder for the 2009 Murano was tough for me - still is. In an effort to reduce my ""carbon footprint"" and experience a much smoother, luxury-like ride, I just leased a new Murano S AWD. Nissan did a phenomenal job upgrading from the 2007 model. The CVT is a dream to drive with and the handling is something I never thought I'd experience in an SUV. The only downsides for me: recommended use of premium gas and the sub-par stereo system offered in the S model. For those of us who can't afford the SL or LE, it'd be nice to have the choice in the S model of upgrading to the Bose stereo system. All in all, an amazing vehicle-just need more time to get used to the size downgrade.","CVT, push button ignition, dual front one-touch windows, comfy bucket seats","More/better stereo offerings in the S models, larger rear window, color display for S model"
4.875,New to SUVs,redelmo ,05/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Have always had full size pick ups. Traded in my 07 Tundra for the Murano. Love the comfort, power and handling. Gas mileage a little disappointing so far (only about 18mph). Poor visibility. Very smooth accelaration. Was unwilling to pay for unwanted features just to get leather so had put in after (better quality then factory anyway).  Very happy so far. ",Comfort.  Excellent handling. Smooth acceleration.  ,Inside release for hatchback. XM standard feature. Availability in true white. O.S. handles on side of frame instead of on top of door.
5,My Second Murano,Michael ,05/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just picked up my 2009 Murano. I had a 2005 and loved it. But there's no comparison between the 2 cars. The styling on the 2009 is much better as is the interior. There's more pop in this one, the ride is quiet and smooth. Mine has the tech, nav, prem, leather and moonroof options.  I test drove other cars but came back to the Murano. If you're looking for a mid-size suv that rides like a car you'll love the Murano. If you like listening to music you'll love the Bose system. Do yourself a favor and test drive this SUV.","Styling, ride, and all the toys. The backup camera is great as is the nav and boise system.  The interior is fantastic and the ride is so smooth and quiet You step on the gas  and VOOOOM off you go. The power lift gate and easy folding back seats are great too. So is the pop up bag holder.",Turn lights on the mirrors. A back up beeper to go with the backup camera would be nice. Memory seats as an option on the SL. Not having to get the moonroof if you get the nav option. A little more headroom with the moonroof option.Take away the blind spots. These are all minor things though.

The car is put together well.  Leather interior is incredible.  Driver seat could double as a ez chair in your house.  It is very quiet.  Performance is spectacular.  The v6 with CVT is breath taking. Instruments and controls are all easy to see, read and use.  The front console screams 'LOOK AT ME!' at night.  Very attractive.  Fun and responsive to drive.  Rides and feels nicer than vehicles I have used that cost twice as much. Outstanding vehicle.  Absolutely ZERO ""buyer's remorse"".",The Intelligent Key is worth EVERY dime. I thought it was more of a gimmick at first.  NEVER needing to take the key out of my pocket is great! Color back up camera with guidance info is especially nice aswell. Powerlift gate is gold too! (works with Intelligent Key),"DVD player and moon roof should be available together.  Wind noise when moon roof is open is louder than I would like.  Turn indicators on side mirrors would be a plus for 2010. My current MPG is approx 20. I drive a about 50/50 city & highway. It is midsize cross over with a V6, no surprises there."
4.875,Great All Around Vehicle,Roy Guy ,05/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We purchased the Nissan Murano after reading the overall great reviews from people that had purchased a 2009 Murano. The 3.5 V6 engine is great and I am sold on the CVT, you can't feel it shifting."," V6 engine, CVT, wide view headlights you see all lanes ahead of you including the shoulder. Of course the navigation system, backup camera, blue tooth, XM radio, dual moon roof and leather interior with heated front seats, and the dual climate control. ",A little more cargo space but I wouldn't want the Murano to be longer or bigger or you wouldn't have a crossover SUV.

They wanted me to run 4 tanks for 93 octane this would fix the problem. Well it made NO difference. If you are thinking about buying one of these I would make sure that you do a hell of a good test drive, overnight drive at different speeds and on different roads.  Selling it was the best thing for me to do to deal with it!  ","The nav touch screen was nice, the blue tooth worked well ",
5,Impressed,Peter ,05/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Purchased the new Murano the first of May. We traded in an 06 3 series BMW. We test drove several vehicles that we were considering, Lexus RX330 and BMW X3. After many weeks of reading reviews and test driving all the cars we decided on the 09 Murano. We purchased an SL with premium pkg. and leather. The wife loves it, her decision to go with this vehicle.

After driving many competitors (MDX, RDX, RX350, Edge, RAV4, Pilot, FX) I still came back to the Murano.  Compared to the previous model the '09 offers a more comfortable seat along with a smoother ride.  There seems to be plenty of power, but I notice a slight lag off the line compared to my older Murano (it may just be something I have to get used to).  Nissan has another winner on its hands!","Backup camera (no GPS necessary), Bluetooth, dual-panel moonroof, seat comfort, interior fit and finish, Intelligent Key, power liftgate","Add memory seat option to SL.  Would have preferred Sirius to XM (like my Maxima).  I recognize MPG is very competitive for its class, but I'd like to see Nissan squeeze a few more MPG out of this puppy instead of incresing HP."

Ride is very smooth as you'd expect from a luxury sedan, and steering is soft - no feel of the road while you float along. Plenty of power at your disposal when you need it. However, when you are going slow (under 30) with minimum gas pedal pressure, you can feel the CVT seeking the best gear ratio. Car is very roomy front and back for when you have 5 adults to carry.",Power fold-down back seats with a second set of switches at the tailgate. Double moon roof allows plenty of light. Bluetooth phone system is a must given number of states and towns passing cell phone laws. Absolutely love the totally keyless operation - never take the key fob out of your pocket!,Nav/MusicBox/Bluetooth have wonderful features that only work while the vehicle is stopped - many needed functions are disabled when in motion.

We traded in a 2006 Pontiac Torrent and this was a definite upgrade. We are both impressed with the quality of the Murano inside and out. The interior is very luxurious and well thought out. The seats are very comfortable, and every driver should be able to find a good driving position. We traveled 200 miles to a business meeting and did not want to get out of the car.

This is my third Nissan; however, my previous car was a Volkswagen and I didn't realize how much I missed Nissan until I drove the Murano.  The '09 interior is a vast upgrade over previous models.  So long as you don't mind the lack of a third row seat (which I don't) then this is quite possibly the best ""CUV""/SUV on the market for the price.  It is a perfect blend of power, comfort and style.  The front-end styling is much more appealing than in previous versions.","The driving experience is my favorite feature; however, I love the back-up camera, bose audio system and the black leater interior is very attractive.","Nissan needs to do away with the ""packages"" and allow customers to pick and choose their features.

The Murano was the quietest, most smooth riding and best equipped of the bunch. The auto climate control is better than in any of the luxury cars I have owned. I like the spaciousness of the interior. The smoothness and power of the acceleration is really nice. My major complaint is the front seat.  It is extremely hard and the front seat cushion does not adjust independently from the seat back.  The seat cushion has a very angled upward tilt, to the point of cutting off leg circulation. (I am  5'4"" and this may be the reason) I am hoping with time the seat may soften up a bit.

I only have 400 miles on it running about 20 mpg. The vehicle recommends premium fuel (the manual says 87 octane min) which can be costly with today's gas prices. The fuel tank is large though, maybe longer time between fill-ups.","Comfy seats, quality roomy interior, smooth quiet ride","Fuel economy, aux jack location is behind front center console, cargo area room could be improved if the spare tire could moved.

4.875,"Tried them all, Murano won.",Scott ,04/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I recently bought the '09 Murano after religiously researching all the vehicles in the category.  I found the Murano to stand out from the rest in many ways.  At first glance the vehicle just does not look like its competition.  (Many of them all look alike.)  The inside is very nice.  The leather seats are incredibly comfortable.  Controls are all easy to reach, instrument cluster is nicely arranged.  The engine performance is great.  Rides very quiet and very responsive.  Power life gate is great, very handy.  Back up camera is great, much more useful than I thought it would be.  Aimable headlights are very bright.  The orange light over head creates a soft glow at night.  Awesome car!","Power liftgate.  Keyless entry and start. (never need to take the keys out of your pocket!) Backup camera, dual moon roof.  Leather interior is nicely done and very comfortable.  Various display options on LCD screen. CVT accelerates like a rocket, very smooth. Many, many more.","Around 19 to 21 MPG which appears to be the average I see on reviews.  Its a mid size crossover with a v6.  What would you expect, really?  I can not think of anything that would be worth mentioning here."

The interior looks no less then any other crossover luxury AWD like Lexus or Infiniti, the exterior looks so rock and handsome, its performances are superior with a smooth traction control. My wife and I, we both are Infiniti lovers, but this time we would rather choose this Murano instead of the Infiniti FX or the new EX just came out this year.","Technology packages are so fancy and useful such as: the Music Box, CF card, iPod connector, navigation system and the voice recognition functionalities.

Feel really good about our decision. Rides like a dream. Very quiet and unbelievable comfort. Power is great with the CVT. We got the top of the line with everything except the DVD player for the back, and are glad we did. The interior is great and feels very luxurious. Still learning all the features,but so far they are fairly easy to get familiar with and we love them all. I really like the heated front and rear seats in the LE.","Navigation, Bluetooth, and back up camera with distance indicators is the best one we have seen. Leather interior is beautiful. Great looks. Love the 20 inch wheels and the power tailgate. Love the Intelligent Key system.","Minor things like more cupholders and more space in door pockets. And turn signal indicators on the outside mirrors would be nice. The Mazda CX-9 offers a lane change warning system which is cool(as an option), so maybe Nissan could too. The Murano ride is better. Overall, it is a great vehicle."

But, curiosity got to me, so I went to the dealership & drove one.  Within minutes, I was buying.  The previous Murano was fantastic Â– a well-built, great looking SUV with plenty of neat features for a reasonable cost.  The Â’09 improves on virtually every aspect of the previous version: better build, more power, way more features Â– for less!  For looks, I like this one better now, but all-in- all, the first gen was better looking for its time.   If youÂ’re considering a Murano: a) drive it, b) ask others who own one, c) do a comparison.

It has every option you can get on the SL (i have the dual panel moonroof instead of the DVD).  The wife loves the dual panel moonroof, I love the navigation and the bluetooth.  The start of the engine is a nice growl, and the rearview camera will start your journey out the right way.  The turning radius is great, and the handling of the sterring wheel is fantastic.  The ride truly is smooth, even over bumps and road imperfections, and you will find yourself well over the speed limit if you don't monitor your speed.  The CVT truly is quite nice once you get used to it.

Besides poor alignment, even with power seats they are rock hard! If you ever have had had back issues, I would really take a 2nd look at this before your purchase and consider a more level seat. The design is very poor for lower back support. Also there are numerous blind spots that I suppose can be adjusted to. It's a shame because it's a very cool car otherwise",the way it runs,SEATS

Love this car so far, fit and finish / styling are top notch. Took it to the mountains to go skiing this past weekend and it did great, but not much snow or ice to challenge AWD on yet. Leather is comfortable, moonroof is fun. Am averaging about 19-20 mpg so far in mostly city driving but only 500+ miles on it so far. Very quiet, smoother ride than I expected from SUV. I was a bit worried about buying a Nissan due to their hit or miss reliability but am hoping it is above average like '07 design. I also hope crash test ratings come thru clean.","Leather, moonroof, upgraded Bose stereo, compass in mirror, interior styling/chrome finish.

For me one of the important things is the handling and agility and I'd say it's been great, pretty much BMW-like. Steering and braking feel is excellent. I am getting roughly 21.5 MPG in mixed driving.

It is easy to drive around the city; although, the gas mileage could be better.  Road imperfections, including potholes, are well-handled.  Terrific at high speeds on the highway, very stable with reasonable gas mileage.  Speed-sensitive steering works very well. ","Intuitive nav system with voice command.

I haven't driven BMW X5 which considered to be one of the best sportier handling SUVs, but Murano handles  very well and secure, body lean is very little and steering and break feel is great.

The 09 is so much better looking than the 07s I looked at. The interior in particular is superb in the leather and aluminum trim.  I prefer the SL trim to the wood of the LE.

Back seats are mucho better than the PF too--hated them on the PF for being so uncomfortable.  I'm glad that Nissan didn't cave in and put in a 3rd row seat to mess up the back cargo area.  Good on them for holding their ground.  Buy it--you won't be disappointed!","Intelli-key is my favorite gadget!  20"" rims and tires fill up the wheel wells for a tough looking ride.

Exterior: it still has the same stylish looks as previous models except the grille-work, which gives it an almost ""storm-trooper"" facade which is head turning. Interior: smooth clean lines continue to demonstrate that Nissan has not gone away from its earlier models. Very easy to handle all dash displays and the interior cabin is spacious. Driving: power to burn, tight steering radius, and easier than you might think to park. There is some body roll when cornering (maybe I drive too fast). It drives like a car and with the added horsepower you feel like you can control any driving situation. Best buy for sure. ","Looks, styling, trim and CVT.

The new Murano has a much more luxurious feeling interior with some nice new features such as dual moonroof, power liftgate, backup camera, intelikey and bluetooth with voice dialing. The suspension and CVT seem improved a little. Minor gripes are that the outside temp display has been switched from the center display to the drivers instrument panel and the driver's seat cushion is not independently tiltable. This is the first time that my wife and I have bought the same model vehicle again, so clearly we are happy with the Murano and like the new one even better.","The dual moon roof, power liftgate, intelikey and bluetooth are nice additions as are more standard safety features.
