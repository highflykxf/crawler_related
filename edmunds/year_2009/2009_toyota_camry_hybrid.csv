I've averaged 35mpg getting about 450-500 miles per tank. Also, I NEVER had to change my brakes! It has something to do with the braking system and the promotion of safer/slower driving. I am thrilled with my purchase. All you have to do is get your oil changes every 5k miles and rotate your tires often! Free oil changes at my dealership was a bonus. I changed my tires at 35k and 85k miles. I was hoping by now Toyota would release some sort of AWD Hybrid. A+++","- 35 mpg

2.25,Dangers of Auto Dimming Rear View Mirror,Fred ,08/30/2009,,,2,3,2,1,,3,3,3,1,"In the daylight, it works like an ordinary mirror, but at nighttime it works like a strobe.  In city driving each time you pass a lit sign it decides whether to darken or stay in daytime mode.  There's a lag time in its transformation, resulting in blinding light reflecting in your eyes when you pass a sign, followed by the mirror darkening, then going back to daytime mode just in time for the next lit sign, thus blinding you again.  On the highway, when a car is directly behind you the mirror stays in the nighttime mode, when that car changes lanes the mirror switches to daytime mode and you're blinded by the next car until it gets close enough to activate the nighttime mode.",Steering control radio volume (because radio control sporadically doesn't work).     ,"A way to lock the rearview mirror on nighttime mode.  A way to turn the smart key off and have a regular key.  The manual says only the dealer can turn the smart key off, but the dealer doesn't know how. The dealer and the manual shouldn't give conflicting advice about required maintenance.    "

The leather interior is top notch. It comfortably seats 4 adults. Not being a techno geek, the blue tooth was easy to set up and is crystal clear. Trunk space is small by Toyota standards, but roomy by other maker standards. The ride is smooth and quiet. Gas mileage great. Sound system and GPS are fabulous. ONE ANNOYING PROBLEM: the gas cap loosens itself and causes the check engine light to engage. I do not top off and carefully make sure the gas cap is tightly closed, but it somehow loosens! When I tighten the cap, the light will eventually turn off. Seems related to air pressure in the tank.","It feels like a solid, well designed car. The features are very user friendly and can be pretty much figured out without even reading the manual (but the manual helps). I expected poor acceleration, a complaint a friend had about his Honda, but was pleasantly surprised otherwise.

5,My first Toyota / First hybrid / ,ramzk ,08/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Have had my new Camry hybrid for three weeks now and absolutely love it. I have driven a Lexus LS 400 for the past 14 years. The fit and finish is excellent on this car and I really like the hybrid system. I have ran two tanks of gas so far and have averaged 38 mpg overall in mixed city and highway driving in Atlanta. It is amazing how often you can run strictly on the battery or a mix of very little foot on the gas and battery to increase your mpg. As you pull up to every light or slow way down the engine shuts off and the car is totally quiet. A small touch to the accelerator the engine fires up seamlessly and off you go. The car is extremely comfortable.,Navigation with Bluetooth is awesome and was really easy to set up. Really like making and receiving calls through the navi system and sound quality is incredible. JBL sound system sounds great.  Leather seats are very comfortable. The silver with dark tinted windows look awesome. ,Memory seats. USB hook up for ipod.

The ride is a bit softer than my earlier Camrys but since I am getting older, I do not mind that the car ride a bit softer. I am still learning all that this car can do but I am continually impress on just how quiet the car is and how much better this JBL sound system is. This 2009 feels bigger than my previous models and I have to take more time to get it out of the garage. In 8 to 10 years, I will most likely buy another Camry. These are great cars for the money. ",The JBL sound system is really great and it needs no separate sub woofer. I love the illumination of the dash too. I got this car for the price of an XLE model. I paid less for this Camry than I did for the 2008 Prius. What a bargain.,A bit more trunk space would be appreciated.

First being the dash center console, cool at first, but when driving in bad weather where you need 100% visibility, the lighting is a distraction, and no way to turn it off without turning off the entire dash. Material quality is sub-par, my Hyundai has better quality. Seats OK, material a bit thin, I can feel parts of the springs in the seat. I expected a bit better quality from Toyota, but with that aside, it has been a good car, reliable, and safe, and that's what is most important, 39 MPG overall isn't too bad either.","JBL stereo rocks, quiet, love the whine when slowing down.

We aren't getting the gas mileage we had hoped and plan to take it back to the dealer to see what's going on.  It seems like the gas engine comes on even when we are going slow, so it may need some adjustment.

Still beating the pants off the EPA estimate!   Highly recommend this.  Why get a Prius and be cramped (unless you want 50 mpg)?  Car does three things:  gives gas engine little holidays including stopped time and initial take-offs (the most inefficient for the gas), doesn't waste momentum- recovers the energy from braking to power the hybrid motor, and gives you all sorts of feedback on how to drive it most efficiently- kind of like playing a video game (though you can ignore it and just enjoy driving)","Hybrid system, great color, VDIM- this car handles well.  Previously drove 03 Camry LE- they are quite different (old LE was a little bigger interior and trunk).  But this is better engineered car- love it.",The main limitation is the trunk which is almost exactly 2/3s the normal 08/09 Camry trunk.

With gas nearing $5/gal, we seriously began looking @ hybrids. No other mfr has developed the time and resources into hybrids.  We found one owner who was nearing 200K on a Prius with no hybrid system related issues. Being involved in such an accident took the Prius out of consideration (no rear end/overhang). We found our ""base"" TCH. The first tank home was 41 MPG highway. But that is NOT where the TCH excels-we jumped from 17 MPG in mixed cycle driving in the van to 38 MPG!

We were on a 4 month wait list for a mid-optioned Prius. Due to size & crash-worthiness concerns with the Prius, we purchased a base '09 TCH. The first tank back home at 65 MPH was 41 MPG. In first 3K miles, we average 38 MPG in mixed cycle driving. This is an increase of 21 MPG over the van (17 MPG in same cycle).","It's like a new $25K Lexus!

4.875,Efficency with Utilitarian Style,john ,10/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"The 2009 Camry hybrid is my first Toyota.  It drives like my old BMW 528i, and has decent acceleration but not mind blowing speed.  The economics of having a hybrid are the selling point.  If you think gas will hit 5 $/gallon and you drive a lot, then this is a car for you.  The looks are those of a non snobby Camry, so you won't feel guilty like in a new Mercedes.  It seems to me the workmanship is the same as a German car.  I tried the Matrix and found that it was more flimsy, and not worth the price.","Navigation system, and voice activation are nice. however the blue tooth antenna is very weak, and that make it difficult to use at times.","Have a more potent blue tooth antenna in the car. Have better blue tooth link with the phone.  Have easier access for MP3 player.  And add the 120 volt plug to plug in standard home electric equipment.

Nice change to regular gas filling up 13 gallons every 500 miles. I love it. Every now and then I miss the stability feeling of the E320, but I also enjoy the ""sportiness"" driving feeling of the Camry. I also enjoy the quietness and how smart this car is. It is full of gadgets and will be paying off over the years. Also I see from the maintenance manual that it's an almost maintenance free car.","The navigator is so smart, although I haven't figured out how to work it out through voice commands. But it is MUCH better than what I have on the Mercedes ML500. The AC is also great, although it is electric. But that's probably why its performance is independent from engine speed.","JBL audio is not that good. Not anywhere near the Mercedes Bose. Sound is flat. Also suspension gives me the feel of a very small light car. So, bottom line: audio and suspension are cheap."

I've debated hybrids 4 years but was disappointed in lack of creature comforts (sunroof) & styling. I thought I wanted another luxury car (I had a Infiniti G35) but live in Hawaii where gas got 2 be $5/g premium & I couldn't justify working to drive a symbol. The first day I hated it (it seemed like a mom car & I am so the opposite) & gas mileage was awful (<20 mpg). I cried & thought I made an expensive mistake. I gave it a week & actually fell hard for it. It's smooth, spacious, luxurious, zippy & a convo starter. I avg 37.2 - 99.9/tank (yup 99, downhill).","I love JBL, cant believe it's better than Bose. Engine braking took a sec to master & use it more than the G's triptronic shifting. I love the quiet & I thought I would miss a deep v6 growl. Blown away at amount of power when needing to go fast. Tank lasts over 2 weeks. Doesn't seem mom-like after all.",Placement of eco a/c button is really odd (inadvertently open gas cap a lot). Cruise control lever is also strangely placed. Wish front seats hugged a bit more (I'm really small & slide around them). Steering could be a bit tighter. Gentle wind gusts really knock the car. Aux outlet area's too deep.

Thus far my first week of owning this vehicle, I'm averaging 43 MPG with a mix of city/highway driving during rush hour traffic with normal driving.  Hands down, the Camry Hybrid has a very attractive design, good quality, pick-up and excellent consumer ratings.

I only have a little over 400 miles on it but am averaging 41.5 mpg so far, mostly mixed country and city driving. In the city I learned to bring it up to speed after stopping for lights, then back off on the gas and it stays in electric mode much of the time up to about about 43 mph. I have a stretch of flat county road 55 mph that I take to town and back and it stays at 50 mpg or just under on that stretch. Fun to drive and sure won't have to worry about speeding trying to get the best mileage out of it.","Quiet smooth ride, sharp look, added a rear lip painted spoiler, installed myself, on the trunk.

Very well planned, very comfortable. It took me just one day to get used to the little quirks of the hybrid.

The Camry is very comfortable and well built.  As with any Hybrid it does have trade offs.  The trunk is 5 cubic feet smaller than the standard Camry, and the fold-down seats pass-through is somewhat of a joke.  You may be able to fit a set of skies through it, though the odds are they would be in a sky rack.  My only complaint about this car is the navigation system.  I feel that Toyota is trying to play big brother by preventing you or your passenger from using the system while the car is moving.

I drove the whole 9 hours necause I didn't want anyone to ruin the mileage I was achieving.  Key to getting this great mileage:  the sweet spot is 57 mph, coast up to stop signs and shift into regenerative braking (B) when you have to slow down (it slows you down, recharges battery and saves your brakes), accelerate steadily up to speed then ease off the gas to drop back to great mileage and use the cruise control.

For example, I can see slight gaps between the plastic and the fabric.  Overall, it is a nice looking car with excellent fuel economy and can fit the family needs.","Still getting used to the operations, but the air conditioning seems to be very good.",Tighten up on the build quality and improve the usage for the key fob

4.25,"Over the ""ooh & aah"" of having a hybrid",Mike from Delaware ,06/28/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"I've had the car from 3 months now, close to 5,000 miles on it.  Not that I'm over the initial ""ooh & aah"" of having a hybrid, what I have is an excellently running, gas saving vehicle, but a little on the boring side.  This is not a sports car by any means, and I realized that when I purchased.  However, the interior just seems to bland and dull to me and the ride is way too soft.  Come time for new tires, I will look into adding on the 18-inch rims and the TRD suspension to ""sport up"" the ride a bit.  I didn't want the nav system because of not being able to program while car is in drive, so opted for cloth seats, but got everything else with it.","Obviously, the gas savings.  Though, I am driving it as I would any other vehicle I've own and average low to mid- 30's in mileage.  Highway mileage is in the upper 30s.","Cheap, cheap, cheap plastic interior.  I think one of these days the arm rest on the driver door is going to snap right off.  The center counsel and center storage bin are made of very cheap, thin plastic.

We are averaging an excellent 40 MPG and we are very happy with our decision!",Push button ignition! Voice activated Bluetooth! JBL stereo system. And our very favorite is the low gas consumption!,Cannot think of any right now.  Love this car just the way it is.

5,Great Car!,LisaAnn ,04/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this car!I went from a 1998 Volvo S70 where I got 25 mpg, and a wonderful ride to this.  I don't miss my Volvo! Smooth, quiet ride, avg 41 mpg in city, and I do not know the hwy yet.  MPG has increased as I've learn to drive a hybrid (very different driving skill).  Controls and monitoring system on dash allow me to keep my eyes on the road. (I did not get their GPS System because my portable Garmin sits quite nicely to the left of the steering wheel at eye level.)","MPG, quietness and smoothness of ride, leg room for back passengers, control layout easy to see and reach without distracting me from the road.","Trunk a bit small, bluetooth is designed for up to 6 phones, therefore phonebook capability per phone is limited to about 19 or 20 numbers.  Given that I only have 1 phone, 1 driver, this is not helpful. Currently no way to bypass to combine the phonebooks capability."

5,2009 Oregon Camry Hybrid,2009 Camry Hybrid ,04/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,My Camry Hybrid has been delivering better than the EPA estimate of 33 MPG city mileage at about 34-35 on the first three tanks of gas. Performance seems better than the 2008 Honda Accord EX-L 4 cylinder I also test drove before deciding on the Toyota and much better mileage to boot. The loaded Camry Hybrid is really close in price to a comparably equipped Camry XLE V6. ,"Very queit ride compared to the Accord, heated leather seats, dual zone climate control, Blue Tooth phone link, excellent JBL stereo, high quality materials and workmanship.",More distinctive styling to set the Hybrid apart from the regular Camry would have been a nice touch.

4,Coming from a BMW,Mookie ,04/16/2008,,,4,4,3,4,,3,5,5,4,"OK, so I'm a 4X BMW owner.  This time around I decided to try a hybrid.  The TCH is no BMW, not in performance, handling nor build quality.  But I didn't expect it to be. What did surprise me is that it's fun to drive, has a lot of conveniences (with the nav package) and I'm getting 35+ MPG. That's the whole point.  I went from 20 MPG to 35 MPG and Premium to Regular.  I've about halved my weekly gas costs. I don't regret my decision.  But if I win the lottery I will buy an M6.",MPG. Navigation system.

4.75,Believer!,TD ,04/13/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Traded a BMW 745i for a Toyota Hybrid. With gas approaching $4 for premium it was time for a change! Tested Prius but could not make the transition with hardly any creature comforts available in this region. Didn't discover the Camry until the last minute.  Customer reviews here and elsewhere on the web boast how great this car is so I went to take a test drive.  Truly, I thought I would give up a lot to save gas and the environment but instead was quite surprised!  Got the hybrid fully loaded and couldn't be happier.  Every day I ask myself, ""what took me so long!""  Get a Camry Hybrid!!","Navigation! (So much better than the BMW's.) Much more user-friendly, too. Gas mileage, Bluetooth, SmartKey. Comfortable cabin.",4 wheel drive would be nice.  Maybe better horsepower in the future without sacrificing gas mileage.

5,Outstanding Camry!,hdworkman ,04/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great ride, quiet interior, great gas mileage. I went from a Ford F150 to the Camry for the gas mileage. Wow what a great car. The seats are very comfortable which also wrap around you. I am adding Sirius radio which is on order now. I am getting quite a few inquires from my coworkers on the gas mileage and power. I tell them my first tank right now is around 35 mpg and the car also has great pickup.","Seats, Bluetooth, gas mileage, ride and comfort.",None at this time. All in all it is a great car.

4.875,Fun to Drive,pat85 ,04/01/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded in a 4Runner on the Camry Hybrid. I went from 15 MPG to 38.6 MPG I drove from the DC area to Johnstown, PA over the weekend. The trip is about 220 miles one way going up and down mountains and cruising up there at the speed limit +5 on cruise control I got 38.6 MPG. I got a red Camry with every bell and whistle. The nav system is OK.  Most of what it tells you is on road signs:  ""exit 38 is 1/2 mile on the left"" sort of thing. ","Keyless entry and ignition,comfortable seating, dual climate control.",Trunk space could be larger since the batteries cut into present trunk space.

5,Outstanding car!!,Northwest mom ,03/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is both luxurious and economical.  The driving experience is quiet and soothing.  I do a lot of highway driving and it's just what the doctor ordered. The brakes are especially impressive, but the gas mileage is probably the best part.  The gas mileage feedback system really helps you drive more economically.  ",Integrated phone/navigation screen and speakers; fuel economy; driver's seat comfort; ESC; quiet ride.,Update that navigation DVD!

5,Overjoyed,David ,03/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5," Wow, what a car.  The 09 is slightly bigger then the 08 which enlarged the trunk somewhat.  It is one good looking auto.  Electric motor battery is relatively small and is attached under the rear window shelf. Love the keyless system--when you carry the fob it knows it's you and unlocks the door as you approach.  Push button start is very futuristic and fun. Gas mileage is great.  My first tank in town averaged 33 mpg.  On level road at 65 mph the fuel consumption stayed steady at 45 mpg.  Continuous mpg display replaces the tachometer. The ride is solid and smooth and the car handles great. Good power as the electric motor supplements the gas engine when needed.     ","Gas mileage; appearance inside and out; smoothness of transition from electric motor to engine and back; ""no shift"" transmission; seat comfort; roominess; the word ""hybrid"" on the side of the car",A slight whine in the transmission when stopping; some shudder when the engine starts and takes over the drive.  Can't notice the transition if the engine's idling prior.

4.875,hybrid holiday,bill prinz ,03/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"It's not overly responsive but quick and friendly, fun.  Small turning circle very easy to manage down the road. No real issues looks great.  I find myself trying to manage great mileage numbers and therefor it slows down my driving a tad.  No lack of acceleration.","7 air bags, iPod hook-up, stability control, heated seats.  Don't feel like I'm giving up safety or comfort for mileage.",Would be nice if the trunk had better access to the back seat for those times when I need to increase the cargo space. Not a larger trunk just better accessability to join the rear seat and trunk.

5,2009 Camry ,09CAM ,03/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Excellent car on the road. Seems to float on the highways, but you are always in control. Mostly in town driving, averaging 38 MPG. On board display is good. Calculates your MPG and informs you of how many miles you can drive before fill-up. The electric motor can't be heard when you are at a stop light,stepping on the gas pedal engages the gas engine which provides seemless acceleration. When you approach a stop sign and slow down, you can hear a little transmission whine. Great hybrid car.","It's the hybrid system itself. No need to charge the system, just put gas in tank every 600 or so miles. The push button start and door/trunk lock/unlock sensors are the future, no buttons to push or keys required.",Trunk could be bigger.
