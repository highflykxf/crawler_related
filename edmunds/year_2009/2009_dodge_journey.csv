1,If you actually need a vehicle...  This isn't it!!,Mr ,09/29/2016,,2,1,,,1,1,1,2,,,We didn't have this vehicle long at all when all of a sudden...  Sometimes it would come on other times it would not.  It would just click..  Starter replaced to no avail.  The air conditioner does not work half the time.  The passenger side door does not unlock unless manually unlocked.  This is a piece of crap car!  I am through with Dodge!!  I tried 2 of their caravans and now their Jourmey...  Dodge has lost some loyal customers and anyone I come into contact with as well!!!,,
3,This car has problems,Michelle Hurter ,09/16/2016,3,4,4,,,2,4,3,4,,,We loved our Journey when we purchased it.  Unfortunately there have been several recalls on this vehicle that we have been waiting on Dodge to correct for over 18 months.  They claim that they are still waiting on parts to correct the issues.    Drivers door power window module has now went out for the second time.,,
1,melted spark plugs,Todd ,05/19/2016,2,3,3,,,2,3,3,3,,,"This is my parents car.  1rst problem as with many other vehicles it's the first model year.  biggest issue happened while driving them on a moderate trip (a few hundred mile round trip)  the car started losing power.  All gauges read fine.  Eventually the check engine light came on so I got off the highway and pulled into a garage.  the mechanic plugged in and checked the codes.  Computer showed a misfire on cyl. 2.  When he tried to pull the plug it would not come out.  After some effort on his part it finally came out.  To our surprise the end of the plug was melted away (gone, no electrode, nothing).  He checked the other plugs which were fine.  After cleaning the threads he put in new plugs and cleared the codes (all 1 of them).  Car started and ran fine.  A few weeks later it happened again.  But this time 2 plugs were melted away and a 3rd showing damaged.  They took it to the dealer, who said it was caused by overheating and stated that it would not be covered due to abusive driving, saying they should have shut the car down when the temp gauge went up.  Only problem their is that the temp gauge never went up to show overheating nor did the check engine light come on until the plugs were already damaged.  {Now for why,  the cooling system has 2 thermostats an upper and a lower.  The upper regulates the temperature of the head and the lower for the heater and the rest of engine.  The upper thermostat went bad and stuck in the closed position, problem here is that the computer only has a sensor for the lower thermostat and the same goes for the temp gauge.}  We called dodge and they were sticking to the dealers diagnosis and cause.  In the end I had to have a new/used engine in.  I explained the issue to the garage that did the work (obviously not the dealer {Browns of Greenfield, MA} and they seem confused or thought I was until I picked it up.  They saw what I was talking about and agreed on the poor engineering/design.  Buyer Beware.",,
1,Do Not Buy,Megan ,04/21/2016,1,1,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,"This vehicle is a hunk of junk. I purchased it used with 80,000 miles on it and in the first four months of ownership - the transfer case cracked causing the drive train to fall off entirely. My check engine light came on for an emissions sensor. I've also just been told that I need new rear breaks, a new ball joint, AND hub. I bought this car because my last vehicle had the engine seize on me. I was in great need and made a quick decision - never again. I'd rather flinstone my way to work then drive this car another month. On top of all the repairs that are required - there's also a recall out there for the airbags not deploying in an accident. Great. Will be trying to sell it back to the dealership because I'm sick of feeling unsafe in my vehicle.",,

I had to replace the tires three times, When it rains water leaks into the car through the vents and the lights and the car doors which then leak down into the floor compartments and has caused mold. The DVD player screen has not worked in 4 years I am sure due to water damage since water constantly leaks in. The interior is horrible everything is falling off and apart on the inside. The transmission is horrible. I have had to replace the fuel injectors twice. The car has cut off on me several times while driving. Occasionally the car does not start up the antifreeze leaks out which I have had repaired but it still leaks. Many electrical issues. Its a damn shame for dodge to make such a crappy car I am not rich and I have spent so much money from the purchase to the repairs and dodge does nothing I will never buy a dodge again!!!",,

When she runs, she runs like a raped ape.. again, when she runs *sighs*First it was the ignition recall: scary as h*** losing all power and control at 70mph.. About once every 3 months. Finally got the L25 recall notice (2 days after first highway-shutoff).. Delay after delay from dealerships on parts (""oh we have parts..just not all of them"")..finally had the recall performed, 2 years later (ironically, after the Feds slapped them with a monster fine for dragging their collective feet over completing recalls).Now our '09 Journey makes beautiful yard-art.  3 batteries later (and numerous, frantic/exhasperated phone calls from the Misses ) I drop in a Red top gel-cell.... Same problem 2 days later. Turn ignition and ""clickclickclick"".We stopped using the remote/security because of the complaints we've read (and verified by a dealer).. Nope.

3,Nice Car - If You Can Get It Started,Dennis Schulmeister ,01/14/2016,2,3,2,,,1,4,3,4,,,"For some reason, after passing the 50,000 mile mark, the 2009 Journey decides if and when it wants to start.  Dealers have numerous guesses - most of which make no sense - but no one seems to have found a permanent solution.  Dodge doesn't seem to care if the owners are satisfied or not.  They have known about this problem for several years and have offered no ideas.The dealers will tell you that their computer has determined that your battery is bad - even if you just spent several hundred dollars replacing it.  In most cases it isn't the battery.  For some reason the anti-theft starter lockout system engages and the starter will not operate.  Another problem (in my estimation) is visibility.  The windshield pillar/outside rear view mirror location combination allows for a significant blind spot where whole cars can disappear.  The very large mirror (great size!) housing should be suspended from the top instead of the bottom.  Mirror would still provide excellent vision to the rear of the car and it would substantially decrease the size of that blind spot.Bottom line is that the car is above average in almost everything including the frustration it causes the owner because of the unreliability issue.  I suspect the resale value will come up quite a bit if the starting problem is ever solved.  THANKS DODGE FOR MAKING A VERY NICE VEHICLE THAT BECOMES USELESS AFTER 50K MILES!",,

4,One of the lucky ones,F. GOMEZ Jr. ,08/28/2015,4,4,4,,,3,4,4,4,,,Review how often brakes and rotors get replaced. Make sure there are NOT aluminum caps on tire stems. I bought brand new and have had few problems. I know have to get a tranny and cost is unreal. Other than that it has been a good vehicle for me. I used to drive it 20k miles plus annually but now I do mainly city driving. Think it does better going long range where I got 35 plus mpg a fee times. Will keep it till it dies (or I do).,,

Flash forward till 2013, my transfer case exploded on me and then in January 2015 my transfer case exploded a second time.  In Feb. 2015 my drive shaft broke, and now in March 2015 my power train module has completely stop working.  Called all of this in and the dodge warranty people was very rude and nasty to me.

There are lots of storage spaces and plenty of room (we have three rows of seats).  However, the attention to detail and quality are lacking.  Our brakes needed replaced at 26000, which is definitely early.  Whatever pads are installed at the factory simply aren't adequate.  The overhead sunglasses holder (near the sunroof controls) wont stay up.  It is a very poorly executed design feature.  All of that said, this is a first year model, my experience over the past 20 years of owning cars (Dodge, Jeep, Mercury, Pontiac, VW, GMC, Honda, Mitsubishi) is that first-year models have issues.  ","The design and features.  There are so many innovative storage areas and features, it's impressive.  If it were executed with a bit more quality Dodge would have a segment leader with the Journey.","Tightening up the quality.  The big hit I always read about is Chrysler's reputation for shoddiness.  I disagree with the shoddiness point, because I've owned many Dodge/Chrysler products and have rarely had any issue, but this Journey is probably the poorest quality Mopar I've owned."

I'm sad to say that the way dodge is handling the problems of 2009 journeys is going to cost them many customers. It's not worth buying a new car when you have to replace it two years later.

Went for a oil change, they told us that the tires need to be rotate what a joke they forgot to tied the last tire and we lost a tire on the road good thing we were not on the highway. After that then came another major problem we couldn't start the car sometime it start and sometime it didn't they change everything on it from the battery, computer, cable and the last one is that there is a leak of oil in the motor.   No way there gonna sell me another Dodge I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEW BEFORE BUYING ",The only good thing in this is that the comfort in it is good and the mileage on fuel is really good.,Just listen to the customers instead of laughing in there back when they leave.

It has now been there 5 times for the brakes. They resurfaced rotors at 9000 and replaced back rotors at 12500miles. I have had it back 3 weeks and my brakes squeal and grind still. It is a horrible braking system. I have 3 children i drive in this car and absolutely do not feel safe.  If I wanted this many probs. i would have bought a used car. All this not to mention it feels like it stalls when i accelerate and it always makes some horn like noise when i start it all of which they can't seem to correct. HORRIBLE CAR!!!!!,,Braking system needs to be recalled. I am obviously not the only one who has these issues.

It was NOT covered by Warranty so I had to pay out of pocket.  One month later the same front breaks began to make terrible squeaking noises again.  I had to take it back to the mechanic two more times and eventually had to have the rotors cut. I'm sure this is not the end of my break problems but just the begining. When is Dodge going to recall the breaks??????",The concept of this car is great but the craftmanship is horrible and Dodge does not stand behing their work or treat their customers properly.

I have accepted the minor problems (broken visor, inconvenience of early recalls, and panic alarm going off when using the keyless entry); but the expense incurred for brakes and rotors going out after 18 months is just NOT acceptable! And to be told it is a ""normal wear and tear"" problem not covered by warranty adds insult to injury.

The interior is very convenient in many ways. My only complaint is that for a 6 cyl I do not get good gas mileage.  I am getting only 10.4 to 11.1mpg on local traveling.  I get the same mileage as on my 8 cyl Tahoe which is a much bigger vehicle.  After reading all the other reviews I do not understand why I am getting so low mileage.  On a longer trip I only get 14mpg.  I truly hope this improves because I would highly recommend this vehicle to others if it was not for that one complaint.  ,It is a perfect size for me and I love all the storage this vehicle offers. The interior lighting is wonderful.  It is really the perfect crossover. ,Gas mileage

I read in one of these reviews that it is an engine mount problem. I have to drive my Journey real easy it seems. Wouldn't buy this car again and would not recommend it to anyone.",,

Have been told that is normal. The power windows don't always work.  The dealership couldn't duplicate or fix the problem. My key doesn't work every time. The sunroof leaked.  We do not get the promised gas mileage. I complained that the car pulled to the right. Months later a recall was issued on that problem. The door trim falls off.

Freeway miles for a V6 23-24mpg is awesome, and even city around 19-20mpg is great.  Have not had to bring it in for anything small, but its a good feeling that the engine and powertrain are covered for as long as we own the car, which I have a feeling will be a very long time.  Dodge built a great vehicle, that I think will be a favorite for a long time.  So happy with this car, that when I go to trade my truck in this spring, we are going to buy a Dodge Ram, can't wait!!!!!","From accelerating, to steering(get the 19 inch rims, get an upgrade on steering and suspension) the style and quality is great.

It had been raining all day on Sunday and when my husband and I went to take friends out to dinner, the passengar side in the front was flooded with water.  You could see where it looked like it ran down the door.  Windows and door where shut tight and the overhead console when I turned the corner, had water running out as well.  Have an appointment on Thursday.  Hopefully, the car will not start to smell and they fix the problem.  Will see how it turns out.  Also, the car could get a little better gas mileage.  It's almost like to much car for the size engine.","I like the bluetooth accessories, the leather interior and the 3 rows of seats.","I think that if the engine were a small 8, you might get a little better gas mileage since it would not be such a strain on the engine.

The car would just shut off at times while at stoplight, I took it to the dealer each time this happened and after the third attempt they were able to finally correct the problem.  Next my brakes and rotors needed to be replaced, I couldn't beleive a car with such low mileage would need brakes let alone rotors replaced!  Now the engine light comes on while I'm driving, and starts flashing and starts riding really rough as if going to stall out.  I pull over restart the car and it drives fine again.  Not to mention the interior issues, water stains on seats and torn insulation that frames doors.  Poorly made car!",I was impressed by the design and size of the vehicle.  Like the storage space and compartments.,Better quality seat fabric to resist water stains.  Install better brake pads to prevent premature wear and tear.

4,Don't Drive in the Snow!,BBD ,01/16/2010,,,1,5,5,5,,5,4,3,4,I got my Journey in July 2009 and absolutely loved it until winter came.  This car does not do well in snow or ice.  I have gotten stuck 3 times this winter in just a light dusting of snow because of the front wheel drive traction control.  We were parked on a small incline and it was a little slick and the wheels just spun.  My husband had to get out and push until we got come traction. Also I was going through an S-curve and the road was again lightly dusted with snow and the back end started to swing around on me.  I turned the wheel back the other way and it started coming back around the opposite direction until I came to the stop sign where the snow plow had salted the road.,This car has all kinds of neat cubby holes and storage places.  We got the stain resistant cloth seats and any little stain wipes clean with a damp rag.  The car is very functional for a busy family.  We also got the third row seating but is is absolutley no leg room.,Fix that traction control thing!  This car needs to plow through snow and ice like the old Dodge Omni. Also the screen that shows all the radio stations/sattelite radio is very distracting and in the wrong place.  It should be up higher and the controls down lower where you can reach them.

Also, we had to replace the brakes at 12000 miles and Dodge wouldn't cover it.  Set back over $160 for a repair that shouldn't be made for another 40,000 miles.

Whenever I put the car into drive or reverse, it does so roughly.  They say it is a PCM and computer update problem and we will see if that fixes it tomorrow morning when they test drive it.

With luggage rack and lots of neat storage, we love it!  The seats fold down easily for hauling all kinds of stuff.  Be careful of 90° opening rear doors...tend to bang other cars in garage or parking lot.  Love the Sirius radio and climate control!  So much better than our Honda Odyssey (yes, I know...but we NEEDED one 8- passenger vehicle and the domestic options are so limited).  LOVE this car!  And out the door for $19000.","Comfortable driving position, handling, safety.  Very well-thought- out features make it easy even for our kids to operate the seats (ages 5-14).","I agree about moving the stereo up higher on the dash.  Also, dials get hidden behind steering wheel for taller drivers like me.  Wish mileage was better...17-19 so far in mostly city driving.  Got better in my 1996 Grand Caravan (19-23 for city)."
4.75,Great choice for us,seveninavan ,09/16/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Overall, I have been very happy with my decision to purchase the Journey.  I traded in a Dodge Grand Caravan and initially planned to get another one, then I saw that the Journey held seven passengers---a must for us since we have five kids.  Except for one small trim issue, everything works well.  I mainly drive to work, soccer games, and boy scout camping trips.  Got the SXT with roof rack and Sirius out the door for $19,600 and 0% financing--- about $12,000 less than the Ford Taurus X.  So far, I've been quite pleased.  Morning carpools are easy, and when I need to haul stuff it is great to have the ability to stow the seats flat so quickly.  I love it!  ","Very comfortable seating position.  Easy to access third row. My wife loves the Sirius, although I can live without it.  Seating arrangement is very well designed.  Easy to change for different numbers of passengers.  I like the storage options and the overall size of this vehicle.","I agree with others about the placement of the audio display.  Should be higher on the dash.  Also, it is hard to see the gauges behind the steering wheel."

I took it to the dealer and they stated the gas cap was not sealed properly, they opened it and closed it and said it would reset itself in 50 miles of driving. Well I drove it for the weekend and it stayed on. I took it to the shop for the second time. They reset the indicator light and sent me home. I drove about 20 miles, the light returned. I took it to the shop for the 3rd time and they said I needed to replace the catalytic converter. They sent me home for the weekend. I traded in my Mazda for this and I'm regretting every minute of it. The reason we buy new is to avoid these things right? It's a lemon!","Free Satellite radio, comfort, space.",Too many to list.

I had a noise every time I turned left, they fixed it, and I had vibrating in the dash, they fixed that the second time. But now my brakes are completely gone on the driver side. There is no way that should happen at this many miles. Chrysler said they would pay for the labor, well I guess that is something. If I have to go back in another year or after 26000 more miles because the brakes are gone, we are going to have major problems.

I drove it about 3 miles to the dealership and let the service manager ride with me to verify that I had a valid complaint. We drove several miles and it would not change out of 1st gear. I left it at the dealership and returned several days later only to learn that the transmission was working fine. Normally the transmission will slip and jerk in to gear after a delay. The Journey also will ""die"" for no apparent reason. The seats are uncomfortable and the ride is terrible! I would not recommend this vehicle. ",Average fuel economy is 20 mpg.

Car made thunking noise, found out the motor mounts were never tightened at factory.  When pulling into the grocerly store parking lot, this car creaks and groans like a 10- year old used car with 150K miles.  My brother-in-law told me to buy new to avoid someone else's headaches. Ha! I deserve this for listening to someone else's opinion. ","Comfort, seating, room.",Quality control.  Dismal economy for a 4 cylinder...a friend with the V6 gets the same average (20mpg).

5,Fantastic Value For The Money,sfriend ,08/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have read other reviews here and I have to say that most of the complaints about the Journey are just absurd and elementary.

As far as transmission problems,we have have not experienced any,but that's not to say there aren't a few. As I drive around town I can't help notice all of the well marked courtesy vehicles from Mercedes, BMW,Acura and Lexus. Why do your think they are out there? Its not because they are getting an oil change! Most All brands have issues & recalls. We have the SXT model.

You will not find a better value for towing, passenger capabilities and comfort with an AWD feature amongst any of its competitors. There is a glaring difference in the vehicle performance with either the 4-cyl or just the standard FWD/suspension unit. All around solid and have not had any significant quality or performance issues the first 3000 miles. V6 with AWD will now only be available on the 2010 R/T's.

Now maybe I'm used to the bigger Cummins Diesel power, but this thing needs a little more juice, and the gear ratio makes shifting a full time job when traveling & doing hills.  If you want the best performance, you MUST shift manually, and that gets tiring, after all, I bought an automatic!  I think they could have done better.  I also think the passenger side seat should be power also.  The ride is very comfortable, my husband finds it almost impossible to stay awake when we are traveling, thus, I end up doing all the driving!  For the price, I love the car, will I keep it?

Another plus, is the amount of room this car offers, especially with the seats folded down. We often have our 3 dogs and our grandson with us and there is plenty of room. The only thing I really don't like is that the Nav screen needs to have a control on it-because its too bright at night and during the day you can not see it if you don't manually adjust it by going into settings. ",The power excellent in snow its exterior style and colors offered The amount of interior room Added storage compartments Optional 3rd row seating that folds flat   ,Add a dimmer control to Nav screen Upgrade interior (Dash & seating comfort) Have back up screen give warning beep (blind spots block view of pedestrians when backing up in parking lots)
3.625,Transmission and other concerns,Lori ,04/30/2009,,,4,4,4,1,,3,4,4,5,I have now owed my Journey for four months and it has been in the shop for about a month of that time. I have had a new transmission installed at 6000 miles. I drove it for 4 days to have a pinion seal leak transmission fluid all over the parking lot. That repaired and now the new transmission is showing the same signs as the prior one. It does not want to shift smooth into second. I keep getting engine lights and they stated that I have an emmisons leak and they are working on finding that. The dealership is great with the repairs and the help with the car but no matter how much I love the car itself but it does not a reliable choice for someone driving as much as I do with the kids..      ,"Interior, smooth ride, reclining seats in the rear, storage, cargo space LOVE the set up if the car! Nice roomy rear passenger seats as well as good leg room in the front.  ",I do not know what to suggest as I do not know if this is just my car or if this is a very large underlying problem with the drive train of these cars.

I'm always on the road for  both business and pleasure(16K since buying mine Sept 08). I work hard, play harder and often haul gear, a minimum of two additional passengers their skis, snow boards, camping equipment, golf clubs...the list goes on!  My Journey has handled it all with ease.  Just returned from a 5 hour road trip and my passengers all raved about how comfortable it was...even compared it to my friends BMW X5 but with more space and a far lower price tag! Did have one BIG problem with breaking system and after 4th visit it was fixed. My dealer rocks and treated me right so overall I am very pleased.","Serius Radio and the cargo capacity with all the hidden storage compartments. I keep snacks in the bin between the front seats and bottled water in the dashboard cooler, as well as in the pocket on the door panels, and under the floor boards ...life savers when caught in traffic or on a long trip!","Would move the touch screen up a bit higher on the dash.  Suggest they focus on getting bugs out of this new model...my breaking issues and other things I have read re. noise when turning left although I have experienced it only once or twice.

I still feel that way BUT   when gas was over four bucks a gallon I was smiling at my Improved mileage. I was a bit worried about what it would do in snow since I couldn't find meatier tires.  I have to say it went every bit as good at the GC and I was even going thru snow on roads that weren't even plowed this past winter. When I got home I had snow caked in the grill.. So I guess I will live with it for another 24 months and see whats available when this lease is up. There aren't that many on the road where I live.  ,I have to say I LOVE the sirius and wonder how I Ever lived without it. Like the gas mileage. I rarely dip below 20 mpg.

I've only had it 2 weeks and so far so good. I've just come back from a 1000Km trip and liked the feel and quietness of this vehicle on the highway. Handling is good, ride is a bit harsh, but I'm assuming that's because of the winter tires. My biggest complaint about this vehicle (to date) is the way it was designed to handle dirty road conditions in winter, ie. salt. First off the rear window wiper only wipes about a 135deg sweep. The wiper pivot is on the wrong side leaving a 45deg swath of dirty window right where you would normally be looking to find where a car should be when passing it.

Don't know just why some duck put 19in. rims on this thing but here in northern N.B. most of us have extra wheels with snow tires. No one has 19 in. snow tires (scared to ask how much). Base wheels are 16 in. and would be OK except can't get them, sold out so far. Comfortable and quietest Dodge I've owned so far. ",Good seat position (power seat). Quiet. So far no rattles or squeaks. ,"Make rear seat headrests removable as no driver room when seat back down. Put the button to control the odometer where it should be not behind the steering wheel.

4.75,Looked Around,Randy ,11/03/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"It was an easy choice after looking around at foreign crossovers. Sitting in the Journey, even without driving it, sold it to us. Roomy compared to it's foreign counterparts and extremely comfortable. It is a great transition family car for those wanting to move away from the ""van"" look yet maintaining the ability to transport your kids and their friends.  Very happy with our first 1500 miles on it.  Extremely comfortable and easy to drive. While some of the interior plastics aren't what I would call ""quality"" looking, they are functional and easy to clean and maintain. Wouldn't go back to the ""van"" for nothing!",,
4.625,Enjoying my Journey,Angela ,10/31/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,Just got my Journey one week ago but I love it. I am a little upset over buying the convience group II and buying the third row seating and finding out that the cargo cover that is included in the convience group II does not come with it if you get 3rd row of seats. Why do they offer both and not list the exception. It is a rip off!  I also ordered mine with a $500 owner loyality rebate but they would not give it to me when the vehicle came in. I think this is a breech of contract but I am investing both of these. I bought the first Journey this dealership sold and they were not aware of the cargo cover not being able to be installed with 3rd row seating till I ask about it.  ,I love the look of the car with the chrome package and the U-connect and Sirius is great.,Switch the radio and air conditioner locations and spruce up the dash; it could be padded more with some leather instead of plastic.
3,Worst 4 cyl fuel economy I've ever owned,Legacy Tranportation ,10/29/2008,,,5,3,4,4,,2,3,1,2,"Our Journey is used as a Pilot car behind oversize loads. We track performance constantly to ensure profitability and cost of ownership. This Journey has run 97.8% highway miles between 56 and 65 mph. The fuel economy is horrible ranging from 17.1 mpg to an all time high of 24.9 with an overall average of 19.8. We have a 2008 Dodge Ram 3500 diesel that runs with the journey, they alternate position. In front or behind the load. The Diesel 1 ton is averaging 20.8 We are very disappointed with the Journey and plan on trading it asap. We purchased it for the fuel economy and safety, it is safe. There isn't enough power to get hurt very badly.",Interior storage is ample for it's size. Best warranty on the market. When they cover the problems.,"slightly wider stance, improve fuel economy or print realistic numbers, address vehicle fuel and performance problems under warranty as promised.

4.625,I Love it!,Christina ,10/21/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I researched the Journey for 2 months, it took me a few dealerships and a few weeks to finally get what I wanted. I have not had any major problems with the Journey as of yet, I do hear a weird sound when turning left but I have not addressed it yet with the dealership. I would like for the Low Fuel signal to tell me how many miles left till empty. I average about 18 mpg w/i city and have not taken a road trip as of yet. I enjoy the flex seating, the space is a bit cramped, but then again only my children will be sitting back there if needed.","Flex seating, sunroof, backup camera, DVD system",Only suggestion would be to create access through the rear window to  have access to cargo/trunk area instead of having to open the lift gate.

So far major disappointment with the gas mileage,only getting about 25 MPG on the highway not the 35 MPG its supposed to get. We asked about it at the dealership and were told the vehicle isn't broken in until its got 15,000 kilometers, which seems like an awful long time to brake in an engine. We got the journey because of its (rated) good gas mileage, so we are keeping our fingers crossed hoping it will improve in the next few months. After reading some of the other reviews we consider ourselves lucky.","Smooth ride, lots of power to pass on the highway, lots of storage spaces looks sharp","the odometer button is in a hard to reach spot ,move it over don't like the front seats being so high ,makes it harder to back up. the radio should be raised up and switched spots with the climate control"

It is overall a really great vehicle. Yes there are downsides, the third row is cramped, but to get a crossover with out that, Highlander, Flex, costs around 5 grand extra.  For the money that the Journey costs, you get a lot of things no one else offers in the price range. The biggest downside I've found is fuel economy, but I chose to sacrifice it for the other features.  Hybrid Highlander, near 40k, awesome, yes, worth 12k extra, no.  I will say, cruise control is friend, it changes economy by 1.8 mpg on my experience (120miles/day), and instead of going 75, go 65, ","Heated seats (cloth too, cause leather and shorts can be annoying) Steering wheel audio controls 30GB hard drive for radio 3rd row (small, but when you're on campus in rural Iowa, and cars are rare, people fit in those 2 seats rather well) Backup camera Floor coolers Middle row adjusts a lot","The hard drive gives up a lot of space to gracenote, directory of all music so name is automatically entered Adjustable head rests (but that hurts rear injury scores) BRING THE MIDDLE ENGINE IN, the I4 is anemic, and the V6 is more than enough, think of an in between that gets better mileage and E85"

My company pays for my gas so I am not always easy on the peddle.  Surprising I have been averaging almost 22 MPG since the day I bought it.

Everything is working great. Sorry to hear others are having problems with yours.  Gas mileage was better than we expected, the seats were great, the a/c kept up to 106 degree Las Vegas temps, even with the 2.4 L it easily cruised the interstates at 70-75-80 mph. Only the steep hills of Colorado made the 4 cyl work really hard. We had already knew the 4 cyl version was a little underpowered though, so we expected it. ","The smooth quiet comfortable  ride.

So I have had a new power steering pump, new brakes, new shocks, new rotors, a new blower switch, 2 new cal panels, a part in the dashboard, a new air conditioning belt, and 5 new tires, which made the gas mileage worse.

Biggest complaint is a mysterious roaring noise that occurs on acceleration in the 35-45 mph range. Dealer says it is an exhaust resonance issue that can't be fixed, but is common to the Chrysler 6-cyl. engine.

I also love the way the Journey looks-a little edgier than the Ford Edge.,Horrible blind spot on drivers side-have to fold the seat down to see.

V-6 worth the move to the SXT package with AWD. Seats have the correct firmness and adjustments available. Better fuel economy than previous vehicle.,"Need slight re-design on dash, fuel gauge and temp gauge blocked by steering wheel, change placement of cruise controls.

Gas mileage is very good, all in all a super family car that we are very happy about.",The my gig is very cool.  The cooler in the floor is also unique for us and a must for the kids.  The ability for kids to watch a DVD and we can still listen to music is also great.  ,"If the DVD screen is down, forget about looking out the back window.  Don't know how you would improve but it could be dangerous, also some blind spots behind the driver's left."
3.625,Too many problems in such little time,Keri ,07/04/2008,,,4,4,3,2,,5,4,3,4,I purchased my Journey SXT in May and have had it in the shop three times. The first time was for a noise the car made when turning left. I got the car out of the shop and a hour later something went wrong with the transmission and I had to take it back. I then got the car back and noticed while driving home the car made a loud grinding noise when accelerating and then took it back the next day. It has been 3 days since I have received my car back and it is know making a loud popping noise every couple of miles. I would not recommend this car to anyone. ,I love everything cosmetic.,

I tried not to judge gas mileage too low because it was my choice not to buy a compact car. But some bad news, it has been in the shop twice now. Once for a  back seat that would not slide forward and today for a brake light that will not go out.

5,Love this car!,Whitney ,06/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,My husband and I purchased this car in April of 08. We LOVE it. Its our first car of our own and we feel we have made a wonderful choice. It's safe with the curtain air bags in the back. The seats are very comfortable. I love the fact that all the seats will fold down to put large objects in the car. The back doors opening 90 degrees make it much easier to get our daughter in and out of the car. I love all the storage. I can keep diapers and toys in the car for our daughter without having to see them 24/7. I love the style of this car. I'm a young mom and I get the features of a mini van without the look. My husbands mother loved ours so much 2 weeks later she got herself one! Great Car!,"90 degree opening doors, great stereo, comfortable, decent gas millage for SUV, looks great, lots of storage, we live in Louisiana and the AC works great in the 100 degree weather, Great price, all around great car.

She test drove it and told me that it was what she wanted. We had looked and driven many in the $26,000 and under range, and she only liked the Mazda Tribute, until the Journey that is. The journey drives great, and is comfortable. It is perfect for us. Controls are good, sound system is good, plenty of room and storage. After 1000 miles we average about 20.5 mi per gal. It is no speed demon, but as a family vehicle it is perfect for us.","Sound system, blue tooth, heated seats, remote start. turning radius,  all the room inside, there are many great features.","Little better fuel mileage, It needs A/C and heat vents for the second row seats on sxt"

Door open 90 degrees. My son loves the cooler in the front. Tons of storage.",Wish they had full powered seats for the front and wish the seat was a little wider and longer.

The next day, while driving, the car started smoking and the inside filled up with smoke. The car was leaking something from below which was actually dripping in little fire balls.   The car went back the next day.  They said it was a bad axle seal and that the company wants them to replace the part not just the seal b/c something may not be right with the whole part.  Long story short, some hot words from my husband the manager found us a new car.  Picked it up on Tues,  brought it back Wed.  There is a short somewhere preventing the controls on the steering wheel, horn, interior lights from working. So two cars in a week, both returned.","The myGig, DVD Entertainment system. Conv.

Lambdas were too big and too expensive.  Love the design. Love the storage options. Fuel economy on a recent trip averaged 24.5, mixed city and highway, and I have the 3.5 V6. Built in booster seats are perfect for our two girls. It has plenty of power when you need it and handles great. Hanling is tight. Love the 19"" wheels and the MyGig.  Only negative is the huge blind spot, but I bought some spot mirrors and the problem was solved.  I recommend everyone give this vehicle a chance.

4.75,great ride,imaso001 ,05/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,The ride on this suv is amazing. The R/T has a performance suspension and it is well worth getting. The suv hugs the corners and stays steady through out and handles rough roads easily. Has a very quiet ride at high speeds as well. The V6 mated to the 6 speed auto works great together. Don't get the 4 it is underpowered The drive train provides plenty of power and the 6 speed shifts up and down smooth. The third row seat came in handy when my nephews rode to town with us. DVD system kept all 4 kids entertained and the sound quality with the infinity system is excellent. I have had the car for a month now and can find nothing negative to say about it. You can do anything with the MYGIG system,"DVD A/V jacks and power outlet. wireless headphones. backup camera. 3RD row seating. great quiet ride. heated seats feel great in the morning.

Had a hard time finding Green, Was not able to get features I wanted, still ironing that out with dealership. Almost bought Pontiac Torrent but found it a waste of space.

4.75,Finally a SUV for a realistic price!,BBall Mom ,04/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,Just purchased my first SUV yesterday. Previously I had Chrysler Town & Country LXI for 6 years and wanted something sporty but yet roomy enough for my children. Pricing is very  reasonable for a SUV type vehicle.

I am very happy with my purchased!,Style Voice Command feature Very Roomy,Gauge design/format
4.875,Near perfect,Alex ,04/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,A great crossover! Love all the storage space and built in coolers! Only trouble so far is the cramped back seat.

3.75,A Journey SE great value for the money!,Vince &Sara ,04/19/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,3,4,4,3,"We purchased a Journey SE Plus 2.4 L (I believe model specific to Canada) we paid $22,973 for it. We feel a great amount of vehicle for the money. It's safe, roomy, quiet, decent build quality as well as fit and finish. The 2.4 is a little noisy upon acceleration and it's not the fastest vehicle upon take off, BUT it's definitely  something we can live with. We drove it around 80 miles the first night we got it home (2 days ago=). We didn't want to get out of it. We find the seats to be supportive, with a great upright seating position,lots of leg and headroom both for front and rear passengers, ease of entry/exit, we like actually LIKE the basic uncomplicated instrumentation. ","We really like how quiet the Journey is . Other than the typical 4 cyl engine noise at lower rpm. At 120 km/h it's VERY quiet! The 90 degree open rear doors, the ride height,the weight, we actually LIKE the floaty ride too. We feel it has great visibility,and like the rear factory tinted glass.","Other than a  little more power with the 4 cyl, and perhaps offering a 5 sp  Auto, so far we are pleased with the Journey! We did our research, and weighed the pros and cons before purchasing. For us it seems to bet a great fit and are looking forward to driving it on our road trip this August."

I looked at many other vehicles and found this one to offer all the features I was looking for. It was  the best price in it's class. It has fair gas mileage for a vehicle of its size, weight and engine size. I think the space and convenient storage exceed any expectations I had. I can't wait to take it on my first road trip. All in all, it's fun to drive",Chill zone and stow and go seating. Spacious and comfortable room and storage. Standard features and power train warranty.,Inexpensive quality materials for interior design. I don't like the cheap plastic and I wish the radio were on the top of the temperature control panel.

Was definitely worth the purchase price.","19"" wheels are cool-looking... vehicle is stylish.  Nice sunroof and stereo too.","Info Computer needs centralized location, like that of the Grand Caravan. With it on left side of instrument panel is very hard to reach to toggle info.

4.625,Just bought one,Mom ,04/17/2008,,,5,4,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"My husband and I just bought one tonight.  Traded in our beloved Escape.  So far I am happy, the kids like it (well, my son thinks we should have went for a Mustang GT--oh well).  Affordably priced and there was a $1000 rebate on it.  Fine family car, drives nice.  It probably wont turn any heads but that is not what I am interested in anyway.  If it gets me to ballgames and gymnastics meets safely then I am 100% satisfied.","Kids like the middle of the back seat that folds down to reveal cup holders.  LOL  Also, I like that there are 3 shoulder seat belts in the back, much safer than a lap belt.","Pin striping?  It is a little plain.

I am also a big guy...long legs, broad shoulders. Although I wish the seat were larger, I must admit that overall, the car is very roomy, even with the sunroof. Far more room than my 2005 Chevy Trailblazer. There is a TON of room for the 3rd row of seats that I did not take and lots of storage. Still learning all the features including voice commands! Great value for the $$$ spent. CVT tranny is cool too.","Bluetooth system, Sirius Satellite Radio built in and FREE for 1 yr, cooler in rear floor and beverage chiller in the dashboard! Nice instrumentation. CVT transmission.","Could use a little more pep on acceleration, Clock is TINY when in Satellite or CD mode on stero - should also be on display by speedo with other info. better building -- driver's seat creaks and awaiting a part 3 weeks!
