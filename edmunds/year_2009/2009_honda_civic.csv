3,Worst car I have ever owned,Zach Hill ,07/28/2016,3,3,3,,,2,5,2,3,,,"This vehicle, my 3rd new car and my 7th car overall, has required more preventative maintenance and more repair than all my other vehicles combined. I have had to had the transmission rebuilt every 65k miles. This vehicle is not modified (minus rims, which were only added 8k miles ago) nor ever been taken to a track or ridden hard but the transmission has utterly failed multiple times. The paint (which is covered by warranty) peeled off the car within 65k miles as well, requiring a piece-meal repair job resulting in a vehicle which is now multiple shades of blue. The interior, which is this soft-touch foam/plastic combo, cuts easily from any impact leaving scars all over the interior and the pseudo-suede used on the seats and arm rests easily gunks up in high-humidity resulting in a filthy-even-when-clean appearance. The performance leaves much to be desired, as there is ZERO clutch-feel and the throttle is unresponsive and ""mushy"". The steering does respond well with wider tires, but the stock tires sizes were appalling. Moderate acceleration resulted in a burn-out in first and second didnt have the power to pull you from a stop. The tires themselves, even after twice-a-year alignments, never lasted longer than 30k miles per set (typically 22k) because of Honda's drastic negative camber recommendations for rear-wheel alignment.",,

1,Worst paint and customer support,btq4f@mst.edu ,05/21/2016,1,,1,,,,1,1,1,,,"I have a Honda Civic 2009. The paint started to crack and peel from two years ago. the peeling and cracking is now everywhere on the car. It was a shame everywhere I went in these two years. Since I bought the car used, I thought the car was repainted because of an accident. However, I recently searched online and found out that this is a wide-spread problem for various Honda models!!!I called Honda customer service and was told that because my car is just out of warranty (for twenty days) the repaint job should be done on my own expense, no matter the problem was persistent for last two years.Putting aside how much shame and discomfort this car has brought for me in these years, I was shocked how rude and irresponsible they are in dealing with their loyal customers.My suggestion to you all my friends is: NEVER go for Honda for your new car! Compared to the value and respect other automotive manufacturers like Toyota, etc would provide, it is crazy to invest your money on a car that brings discomfort for you when the company also refuses to take responsibility for their defected products.",,

I forgot the light on one night, but the battery held it for about 15 hours! Strong battery and good performance.

5,Bought a car to flip.  Learned to Love it!,Ryan ,12/18/2015,5,3,3,,,5,3,4,3,,,"I bought this car and owned it for a year only because I needed a truck.  What a blast!  The car came with two problems, which allowed for me to afford it at a discounted price.  1.  Radio was crazy.  changed stations by itself occasionally. Cost: $40  2.  Clear coat was fading and flaking off of black paint.  Cost: $0  because Honda extended their paint warranty to 7 years Unlimited miles for all affected models with this defect.  WOW!  I was so impressed with Honda, they repainted almost my entire car with almost no questions asked.  It was so easy, and once I found the right dealer they put me in touch with customer service which went flawlessly.  I can't stress enough how easy and streamlined their warranty process was.  Not only is Honda great, the car was great.  This was my first economy car and once gas was no object I piled the miles on, without care for my mpg's.  Every drive I made exciting, because I could rely on my Honda even under hard use, and it was fun to use hard.  While its not overly powerful, the motor loves to rev.  The Transmission shifts well.  The car is surprisingly easy to drift.  E brake used on a regular basis!   Steering was instant and crisp and there was 0 body roll, unless you loaded it to the brim.  I definitely felt a connection to this car.  Steering feel was excellent, even over 100 mph.  I can't explain how much the engine just likes to go.  Its not powerful, not fast, but its so reactive and fun to drive in the curves, and can cruise happily at 90 mph all day.  My only gripe was the transmission.  Don't get me wrong, it was a fine unit.  If you ever wanted to drive and have fun you needed to manually shift it though.  It was not so much a performance thing as some economy setting.  I had to practically floor it to get a responsive down shift.  Once the Honda decides its time, its lightning quick.  But until then, your stuck out of the power band.  Other then all that, the only creature comforts my car had was a base model radio (acceptable), AC (worked great), and the heater.  The little aluminum block doesn't warm up unless you drive and work it in the winter, but once its up to temp....That heater is a FURNACE.  I swear, it could burn you if you hold your hands too close for too long.  Awesome heater.  Car holds a surprising amount of cargo too.  I filled so full it was practically a truck one time.  Fold down seats.  In summary, I really expected to hate this car, but after owning it for one year I would never have sold it had I not needed offroad capability and towing. (trust me I tried) I truly enjoyed driving it, which is really saying something for a boring economizer like a Honda Civic.  I can see now why ricers like to ruin them.  I brought the maintenance up to date, and the car was better off when I sold it after over 20k miles.  Extremely low cost of ownership.  I tried to drive the beans out of it but it just asked for more.  Surprisingly tough for its size.   I'd also like to add that I have drove later model Honda's that were not as peppy as my 2009 1.8.",,

4,Love my Fa5,Bryguybruins13 ,09/12/2015,5,4,5,,,4,4,5,5,,,"I love this car!!!! Everything about it is truly amazing! The k20z3 engine is a true gem. The car feels pedestrian below 5,800 RPM; however, rev it past 5,800 all the way to it's 8,000 RPM redline and and you will be treated to aural ecstasy courtesy of Honda's infamous vtec technology.  When i-vtec engages the car sounds like a high revving v8, pulling hard all the way to the redline. The i-vtec helps deliver top notch performance (for an N/A four cylinder) while maintaining great gas mileage and drive ability. The high revving k20 engine is pared with an unbelievably smooth short throw six speed manual gearbox. The combination of the engine and perfect shifter make this car a pleasure to drive. However, the car's practicality set it apart from other sporty car options. The seats are comfortable and will hold you snug, the air conditioner is ice cold, and the additional two doors really make life easier. Interior materials are of excellent quality and the faux suede seats with red Si stitching look great. The red gauge lighting and aluminum pedals are superb touches. Other great features include an auxillary and usb port. The car is also well equipped in the storage department. Now, the car does have its issues and those issues are why I didn't give it a perfect rating. For one, the tranny is complete garbage, which is a shame considering how smooth it shifts. My second and third gears grind on a weekly basis. They are fine under normal driving conditions; however, under spirited driving they tend to grind. My second gear loves to grind when I accelerate to the redline in first gear. This has caused me to bang off of the rev-limiter on multiple occasions in an attempt to shift into second. My second gripe with this car is the paint. Like wtf Honda? My car is a 2009! There is absolutely no excuse for fading paint on a six year old car! What makes it worse is that this problem isn't unique to the Si either. My brother's red 2009 Honda Fit is starting to turn pink :(. My last issue with this car is a performance issue. I used to own a 2000 Honda Prelude prior to buying my Si. The Prelude was miles ahead of the Si in terms of handling. The Prelude was more well balanced and neutral when attacking corners. The Si? Well, the Si feels like a wet sponge in the corners. The car's body roll and understeering tenancies are pretty noticeable and are downright scary at times.",,

They have all been wonderful as far as value, comfort and reliability.  The Honda Civic Hybrid is the exception primarily due to the hybrid component.  The speedometer, USB ports, steering wheel controls, and overall comfort inside make for a great ride, but taking a car to the dealer negates the advantages.  I had never taken any of my Honda vehicles to the dealer for any sort of repairs, but the hybrid seems to break every 12 to 18 months. Since the beginning, the IMA light has been turning on like a Christmas tree. I would take it to the dealer, waste at least half a day in the process, and they would normally tell me that it was just an update that is needed. However, a few months later it would start over again.  If you want a civic, get a regular one, not a hybrid. If you want a hybrid, get a different brand.",,

The 1.8 Liter VTEC engine is the centerpiece of this car.  The VTEC allows this engine to have two ""personalities"".  While cruising on the highway, the engine is composed and fuel efficient.  If you step on the gas pedal a little more aggressively, the VTEC solenoid kicks in and uses a second set of cam lobes that makes the engine more powerful.  So, it is literally a two-faced engine that can be both fun or economical.  The transmission will stay smooth as long as you change the fluid on schedule (every 30k miles).  The rest of the car is also well designed, but you need to remember that the Civic is still an economy car.","The engine.  Buying this car for any other reason is silly.  The R18 engine is a modern masterpiece.  I also love the AUX input and the digital speedometer.  The rest of the car is basic, but well designed.

I think if I was an inch taller, I wouldn't make it, but it's amazing how the car can fit me.","Build quality and materials are my only complaints.  Let's put it this way: where it matters most, the Honda is solid, but on less important items, such as interior plastics, the car is cheap (that's how it's affordable).

Its larger, safer, just as reliable, better fuel economy & this time I went for the EX Trim vs the LX last time. The EX sedan is a very nice sedan and offers many great features as standard. The only option I wished I would have gotten was remote start. That is my only regret, so in other words, you can NOT go wrong with a New/CPO/Used Honda Civic EX sedan.","My #1 feature must be the exterior design, followed by a well executed interior design. The fuel economy is so great I couldn't justify the added expense or the hybrid, besides the hybrid
does not have the sporty alloy wheels, nor the power moonroof. I love my civic EX, and the number of safety features are superior. Side air bags, head airbags, side curtain airbags, rear seat side head curtain airbags. A multi 6-disc CD player as std equipment. I will not wait 10-yrs again, for next I will be ordering a new Accord, as its always been a car of desire since 1984. I wish to share another feature, the ability to change volume, radio stations, CD track all from steering wheel, so eyes on road !","Its a bit challenging to see the nose of the civic when parking, and the remedy I found after a year of ownership was to add a bug deflector which alloys me to view the front of my civic better
thus not having to park aways away to prevent scuffing bumper. The manual driver's seat adjustment for up & down could be improved and made to be electric, and heated cloth seats would be a nice added feature to have as standard on EX & EX-L trim levels plus on the Si sport model."

5,It's all about the VTEC,engineaddict ,08/31/2013,5,4,4,,,5,5,4,4,,,"The Civic Si is a fun car to drive. Every time I get in the driver's seat, I smile to myself, even though I'm aware that fun doesn't mean winning over all of the other sporty cars on the road to the next signal light ('cause it is probably not going to happen).For those of you considering the Si, this is my recommendation: test drive at least 4 Civic Si's (so you know when one of these is dead). And, conduct your test drive in two phases:1) gentle, ""everyday"" driving - this also allows the engine to warm up, too.2) then, rev it out! The red line is 8000. Make it go there. If possible, turn off A/C & roll the windows down for this phase.UPDATE:This is still one of the best FWD cars on the market from a performance standpoint. I've read the near-constant complaints from reviewers that the ride is too harsh or the noise is too much. I have yet to get tired of the ""harsh"" ride after three years. The feedback from the ""harshness"" is totally worth it. I've done canyon carving with newer FWD models including the Mini Cooper S and a lightly-modded GTI, and the eighth gen Civic Si still hangs out (and might even pull a little) on the others. Of course, you MUST be 100% on your game with the 6k-8k powerband, but that's part of the allure IMO. It's always DEEPLY satisfying to beat some ""fast"" cars/bikes on mountain roads, and then have them be like, ""Dang, I didn't expect that Civic Si to be able to keep up with my GSX-R"". Of course in an era where everyone is targeting 0-60 times, the Civic Si hangs out at about 7 seconds. That's not what these are about, anyway.The sound is still just amazing. You get used to it, and then it's funny going to other cars and being like, ""Only 6500rpm? Oh right. Most cars don't rev to 8300rpm"". OR ""Wow this car sounds bad. Oh wait. My car just sounds really good."" With all these turbos, I don't see this changing much in the near future.I also got used to the interior controls, and now I find a lot of other cars highly inefficient and awkward. The two-tier setup in the eighth-gens is really a sweet-spot. Visibility is superior for the model year.Safety is STILL amazing. I encourage you to watch crash tests of the eighth gen sedans compared to several newer cars. The passenger compartment stays completely intact. Airbags are like ... everywhere.The sound system would put most cars not in the luxury segment to shame.Fuel economy is directly tied to the skinny pedal and how many short trips you do. For a cruise on the freeway at 65mph, I still get 30+ mpg. For the around-town stuff I'm always doing now, I get about 19mpg. I can kick it up to 22 mpg around town if I'm easy on the accelerator. The trick is to let it rev more before shifting so the VTC can do its magic (3-4k shifts in normal driving). Anyways.Get one while you can. This is perhaps the best-handling Civic Si of all time (so far, at least). The resale values have flat-lined accordingly.",,

You must drive it differently, pay attention and respond to what the instant mpg gauge and battery gauges tell you. Learning to anticipate lights, allow some slowing on hills, feathering the gas, avoiding the use of brakes and staying at the speed limit yield great results. No lead foot gas use, won't go fast anyhow. Winter driving conditions and sloppy driving habits destroy mpg. Large interior, but VERY noisy and not comfortable after a couple hours. Cheaped out on auto on head lights, dash layout, seat adjusters and tires. Did I say it was NOISY? First, and LAST, Honda.","The only reason to buy this car is mpg potential. With care, it can get 50-52 mpg at 65-68 mph in temps above 55 degrees. Winter is more in the 38-40 mpg range. Took about 12k miles to loosen up and produce, but it consistently stays above 44 mpg. I'm surprised and impressed. USB audio is neat.","Seating (leather) is uncomfortable. Heated seats are minimal and slow to heat. No heat on passenger back. Road sounds are annoying! Poor tire wear.

When you want to play, just rev the crap out of it and it rewards you, handling is solid, power is great (above 6000 RPM), and engine notes are extraordinary.

The car is made for DRIVING, not commuting to and from work. The regular Civic is what they should've bought. You get WAY more than what Mazda, VW or Subaru can offer for the $21,000 that I paid for this car even with the navi.

There are a few things that will drive you nuts.  If you are tall, the parking brake handle sticks up and you will whack your leg.  It is impossible to see any part of the outside of the car from the inside so for a small car it is more difficult to park then you would expect.  The rear seat is not divided so you have to fold down the whole seat - a difficult task with the release mounted in the trunk.  The key has become the joke of my department at work.  It is huge (gold plate it and it could be the key to the city).  It also costs over $100 to duplicate.  So solid car with some design issues.",Dash layout is very nice.  The cruise control setup is particularly well done.  It seats 4 adults very well for a small car.,"The two daily irritants I find are the 4"" long key and the parking brake.

MPG varies depending on driver, I get between 17-21 mpg city. The paint is not the best. It will scratch quickly and rock chips cause more damage than it should. I spend too much time and $ trying to care for the paint/exterior. I'm not bothered by the two-tier dashboard. A noticeable problem with Honda's is road noise.

The inside is well made and there's plenty of storage space. The ride is fairly good. I'm looking to up-grade the sound deading abilities... I drive from Houston, TX to Lincoln, NE quite a bit in a given year. I have had this car for about 6-7 months now and I'm trying to pick it apart it's quite hard to find anything to nit pick.

It's still a great commuter, but I agree with many of the other reviews: 1) comfortable on short rides; painful on anything more than 2 hours; 2) horrible power on hills, especially if stopped at a stop light and you have to start on an incline (takes about 3-5 seconds to really ""get going""); 3) very loud on anything over 3000 rpm (aka hills).  I put on aftermaket wheels b/c I didn't like the stock - looks great, but did subtract 3 MPG (but worth it IMO); I've averaged 37.5 MPG over the past 3,000 miles (and that does involve crossing a 9% incline daily to work).  Bottom line - great for MPG; lacks power / comfort.","Dash / display is great; love the digital speedo. Maintenance minder is nice - ""calculates"" based on driving when to change oil - able to go 8,000 miles before first oil change (normally I change at 5,000); Honda reliability.","more comfortable seats; soundproof engine bay more; more low-end torque to get started on hills; offer different wheels as an option; when parking, the engine tends to shut down before I'm done parking so has to restart - someone next to me in the parking lot asked me if my car was broken..."

The dashboard design is useful with the mph gauge sitting above the rpm gauge--have had no problems with it.  If anything, it is more convenient because your eyes barely have to glance down to see your speed.

If you lower the air pressure down to 30psi, you will find the ride quality greatly improved without a loss in fuel economy.

City mileage is not so good though, I am making only 22-23 mph. One of the reasons might be the fact that I usually have to drive in heavy traffic, go little and stop again. Road noise sometime can be a little excessive. Even a little bit of uneven road surface can cause uncomfortably loud grinding noise coming from suspension.

Was I ever blown away by how many changes had taken place in the past decade! The premium audio system in the civic sounds like a home theater set up. The exterior stylings are crisp and flashy and give the car an aggressive look which I like. Driving around town and on the highways is a blast. At first I was worried about the little car's ability to 'get up and go' especially with the highway speeds in my area.

It is very easy to handle and takes corners smoothly.  It drives like an automatic so I can hear when the engine wants to shift and since I'm used to manual, I would shift it at a few different RPMs but I am getting used to it.  I rated it low as fun to drive because manual transmission is more fun to drive.  The dealer didn't have any manuals so I thought I would try automatic.  If you are really set on manual I would hold out for it as automatic is not the same thing.",The air-conditioner has a MAX setting which is great for very hot climates and days.  The speedometer is digital which my son likes because he can see it from the back seat.  This car has 4 doors so it is easier for people to get in the back seat.  The seats are comfortable.  Everyone likes the car.,I would make the automatic windows optional.  I think it would be better to be able to roll them down for when I wanted to leave them just a crack open or in case of emergency. The door locks were tricky for me at first to figure out since I wasn't used to automatic.

It was hard to find one--called around a lot and the few places that had them in the country wanted top dollar.  Eventually found one out of state and purchased end of month--got  a reasonable deal.  It is an awesome commuter car--very cheap to run, extremely reliable, clean burning, carpool lane exemption, and dare I say, even fun to drive.   No, certainly not a sports car, but it corners well, stops well, and accelerates decently.    CNG is well below the price of regular unleaded-- about 40-50% for me, and I'm not Utah--I'm surprised everyone there doesn't have one!  My kids, boss and others say ""cool!""","Very low operating cost, ""greenest car in U.S."", no fuel drips, bi-level instrument panel with great ergonomics, great AC.

A bit more hard plastic inside than I would like (suffers compared to the Accord) but I like the dash design much better. Arrangement of radio and climate controls nicely done and very ergonomic.

However, the thing was falling apart and overall my experience was poor.  I was drawn to the Civic because of its reputation for reliability, fuel economy, and its nice design. After nearly 3,000 miles on the car, I'm happy with my purchase. It's not as much fun to drive as the Jetta, but the 5 speed manual offers some excitement and better all-around control over the car.  I ended up going with the EX-L because on the 2009's it's the only version that offers stability control (VSA).  Also, it's worth noting that I'm relatively tall (6'4""), and I fit very comfortably in the driver's seat.","Steering wheel audio controls, USB port for iphone/ipod, stability control, sunroof, digital split speedometer, remote trunk release, fuel economy (not really a feature, but I'm averaging about 32 mpg in 50-50 city/highway driving).","Trying to control 5,000+ songs on my ipod is difficult through the car's audio controls (you have to slowly scroll if you want to change artists), but that's really nitpicking.

I wish it had better hwy noise insulation. Also wish the seats were not quite so hard and had lumbar support but because I like everything else, I can live with it.

Fuel economy has exceeded my expectations, and the car is very nimble and fun to drive with the manual.  The seats are also very comfortable, and there's plenty of room for me (5'11"") even with the seat raised to its highest position.  I would have rated it with 10's across the board if it weren't for a few things:  1)  Either drive-by-wire or the VTEC mechanism makes acceleration under certain conditions somewhat choppy and abrupt. 2) There's a creaking noise coming from the front suspension, and a rattle coming from the rear of the car.  I can't determine the source of either. 3) Thin paint.  ","The stock EX coupe radio is amazing.  One of the best stock systems I've heard.  It trumps that of a relative's Acura MDX, and the Bose system in the GMC Yukon Denali.  I love the iPod interface.  IMO, the styling is also top-notch.  Performance is solid, minus the DBW/throttle issue.","The paint is ultra thin, but I knew this before buying.

The sound system is 350 Watts and has a subwoofer. This comes in the Coupe EX and the Si's only. Very happy with the bass response from it. Nice Standard Alloy Rims. Shifts are crisp and smooth. I would definitely purchase this car again. Very complacent ride that does a great job around the corners and is comfortable on rough roads. My only minor complaint is something that plagues Hondas and that is the road noise. It's not awful but could be better.,Smooth Shifter...  Sexy as hell... (BLACK)... Nice pickup and engine sounds great. Driving Characteristics...  Last but not least extremely reliable as all Hondas seem to be.  I love the Coupe.,Better Insulation from Road noise.

It has good power unless you're merging into traffic and need to get out there (you may be in trouble).

I only have it for a couple weeks but the MPG is as good or better than the sticker rating.

The steering wheel is very small, especially for a petite person.  When it is windy, I feel like I don't have a good control of the car because I cannot rest my left arm on the door as I was used to doing with my previous cars.   It does not show the outside temperature.  I think this feature should be mandatory for every car that is made.  My husband convinced me to buy it and I regret it very much.

However, at 9,800 miles the front wheels began making squeaking sounds, rolling forward or back, whether or not the brakes were applied. When I took the car to the dealer, the service writer said the brakes were WORN OUT. Those squeaking noises are the brake sensors indicating a need for brake pad change.  Now, I've owned many new cars in my life but I can't recall EVER having to change disc brake pads at 9,800 miles. Brakes are not covered under warranty, so I paid $269 for new brakes.

Mileage drops considerably on short city trips. Dashboard layout and visibility are excellent.

First, the accelerator's new throttle-by wire technology performs well, yet the feel of the accelerator is awkward to me. The pedal is hinged from the floor and I find it a little uncomfortable situating my foot at times.  The other item relates to the transmission.  The automatic tranny seems confused at times whether to stay in second gear or revert to first when executing slow turns or ""California stops"". This confusion can at times result in an abrupt shift of the gears.  Other than that, not much to complain about. Hats off to Honda for building yet another great car!

I really like the dash set up and I think the auto transmission is very smooth.  Lots of leg room also for my 6'4"" frame.  My two kids fit fine in the backseat.

Short throws and creamy smooth shifts.  Performance is great for a 4 cylinder (2 liter) engine without a turbo. It's a rev happy car which performs best at 6,000+ rpm's, and the engine sound is sweet at higher revs.  My car is black which is hard to keep clean but looks great when it has a bath. It's a head turner.  Gave it a 9 on reliability but that's just based on Honda's past reputation cause I've only had it a week with 400 miles driven so far.

The windshield washer nozzles have also been freezing up since I've had the car. It doesn't handle well in the snow but I expected that since it's so light. I do like the reliability that comes with the Civic and it does ride well. Also, the gas gauge seems to underestimate the amount of gas in the tank.

Road noise in the cabin is the biggest flaw with this car. I like the rest of the car, but it's not really any better than the other cars in its class and you pay more for a Honda and get less features for your money compared to say a Toyota.

I did not want to rate reliability, as I have only had the car for a couple weeks now. But for the two weeks I will just say 10.  The Civic Hybrid is rated better in crash test than the Prius, and gets comparable fuel economy. I truly believe the Honda Civic Hybrid is a far better value than any other small or mid-sized hybrid vehicle on the market.","It's safe! Gas mileage is excellent. The built-in USB cable/connector in the middle armrest compartment is great! You can charge many devices from it, it keeps iPods out of the way and hidden from thieves. The car is loaded with features which you often expect in ""luxury"" class vehicle ","I get the impression that electric motor is often doing less than it is capable when assisting from a dead stop. Perhaps increasing power output to the electric motor when getting the vehicle moving from a dead stop would help. However, this will likely require a larger battery."

I have always been trying to find the right car for the small daily commutes and riding around town on small tasks. I always thought having a luxury car was the answer. I traded in my 2006 Acura TSX for the Civic. I was so surprised by this car. I have just enough creature comforts to get by but the ride is very surprising. The room inside is much bigger than I thought. Overall compared to all my other cars I have owned this is the right match for me. Love the gas mileage, comfort and overall use for this small sedan.

4.25,No remote trunk access on LX?,Juan ,11/08/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,5,4,4,4,"I bought my Civic LX two weeks ago and am generally very pleased with it.  BUT, I am disappointed that Honda has not entered the 21st century along with Saturn and other cars by providing remote trunk access with their Civic LX.  The apparent reason: to provide a disincentive to buy the LX, and push you to buy an EX for $2000 more.  So, if you have kids, if you shop and appreciate easy trunk access as you lug items to the car, buy another car. Is remote trunk access worth $2000? Not in my book. Next car will be a Toyota.","Great style, quiet, responsive handling, nice interior. The quality is excellent, except for the lack of remote trunk access. ","Offer minor optional features, including navigation, Bluetooth, USB jack (these are basic features in new Ford Focus, Prius, and a growing number of cars). Definitely leave behind the ice-age mentality of pushing buyers into buying all-in-one EX models with moonroof (which few people need or want)."

The fit and finish of the leather and the whole interior is top-notch, and clearly beats out the 2009 Corolla that I test drove.  Both the Corolla and Civic are very close, but Honda has the edge in appearance inside and out, as well as build quality.  The doors have a nice thud to it, almost like a luxury car, while the Corolla had a slight rattle every timed you closed the driver side door.  It's those little things that made me give Honda my cash.  Both Honda and Toyota are rated #1 and #2 in reliability so it's hard to go wrong...","The dash looks great and refined.  I was leery about the split dash, but actually I prefer it now, and it is very well designed and ""ergonomic"" if you can call it that. ",

After 5 weeks and numerous test drives there was only one choice; the Civic. Handling, MPG, styling and the track record of the Civic's reliability won out.  The only car that came close was the Mazda 3. The LX-S comes standard with 16"" alloy wheels, small spoiler and ""SI like"" seats. The fit and finish are excellent.   I got 34.1 mpg on my first tank (2/3 highway).  The car handles like a dream and the manual trans is typical Honda, smooth as silk.   My Civic replaces my sporty 1994 Ford Probe (Mazda mechanicals) after 201,000 miles. Trust me, all things considered, the Civic is the best car in its class.
