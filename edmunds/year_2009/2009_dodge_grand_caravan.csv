1,#Knewbetter on 09 Dodge Grand Caravan SXT 4.0L,FirstSgt ,07/07/2016,2,3,4,,,1,3,2,3,,,"Bought used 2009 only a few months ago with less than 100K; looks great, but not reliable.  Has developed a serious electrical problem, besides three EGR valves in three months also (OEM Chrsyler part, mucho $$, MUST be used in EGR replacement); had the WIN Fob Chrysler recall work completed shortly after purchase also and since then vehicle has had difficulty starting; has stranded my wife more times than I can count in past few months. Replaced the battery and starter, didn't help.  No one knows what it is and I refuse to replace TIPM while ""fishing"" for electrical problems.  Blogs seem to point towards Neutral Safety Switch, but its ""fishing"" again.  Fishing becomes expensive when Chrsyler can't pinpoint its electrical problems.  Sometimes it will start if you shift to Neutral, sometimes it won't.  Van looks great, but it is not reliable for family transportation certainly. 2nd Row Sliding Door wiring harness recall was ineffective, have wiring frayed and broken and a sliding door that no longer opens or windows the rolls up or down with Fob.  Radio is now locking up and turning itself off and on.  Think twice before biting... price might be affordable for a reason because your going to make your local mechanic very happy with all the service you'll give him.  Had a 99 Dodge Caravan and drove it for 5 years with no problems, loved it; this one, not so much.  Look elsewhere unless you are a mechanic or have a good friend who is a mechanic.  I tried to save money in this purchase, I've not and now it has become a burden; the question every trip is, will we make it to our appointment on time or even at all?  Its been an emotional roller coaster not knowing when its going to start or not and of course, each time it gets to service via TOW... it starts.  I think there might be a Gremlin in their electrical system.  Stay clear unless you have time and money to waste, your salesman doesn't have to drive it everywhere, you do and with your kids inside too.",,

The brakes need rebuilt every 10-15k miles (with rotors and calipers being replaced at various intervals. The air conditioning condensate pan does not drain and fills up with water and damages the fan so it needs replaced.  The van does ""walk"" all over the road (not fun to drive) and wears out GOOD tires.  The interior back seat plastic coverings fall off.  The passenger door wiring is breaking in the tracks (cheap wire).  Other than that, OH, now there is a ""growling"" noise in the front end (bearing?). I Won't buy another Dodge van!.

Long story short, we bought the van used. clean carfax. great the first week. second week was a disaster. van would die 3-5 times daily was exiting the hwy. while operating at 30mph the van would become very sluggish, then die when coming to a stop. replaced spark plugs, MAP sensor, throttle body didn't change a thing. brought in to the dealer to figure it out. diagnosed that the WIN module was faulty and needed to be replaced.(not part of the recall) asked why its sluggish, dealer didn't know. finally just gave up and traded it in for a Honda. People be advised, stay away!","4.0, entertainment system. stow and go.",Transmission shifts too hard. vehicle needs to be reprogrammed to be up to date on current health status and only the dealer can do this update. keyless ignition is garbage!

","After 33k miles of easy driving, the front brake pads should need to be replaced, That's about all.
We've had to have all the calipers, rotors, and pads replaced three times, which is bad enough that there should be a recall and new brakes manufactured and fitted to replace the current non-funtional design.
I bought the van so I wouldn't have to worry about having vehicles fixed all the time, that plan did not work out well.
Chrysler extended the warranty on the front wheel bearings, clearly because those are defective.
The transmission blew up already, and a motor mount is bad.. the build quality... not so good.

Car drifts and moves side to side (cant even explain, its something you have to feel ) steering wheel moves on its own over not smooth road, bumps railroad tracks, etc. Car flexes bad by the sliding doors. Even had transmission experiences and the radio tuning all by itself. All dealers say they don't see any issue, and one said the steering wheel moves to compensate for the road? Personally, I think they know it's messed up and won't admit. So going the lemon route after I hear back from Chrysler! Gas mileage is horrible. ","Love, fits 7 people . Stow and go nice to have.

Let me state first that I do like this vehicle. I purchased one with the weakest engine, so I do sometimes wish I had spent more money and should have gotten at least the 3.8 L one. I had issues with the rotors at 7K which is a well documented issue with this vehicle and now at 11k had a problem with front wheel bearings going bad which is another documented issue. Otherwise, the vehicle is solid with several immaterial shortcomings.

Traded in my 86 Vanagon and got a $29K van for $17,5.  I never thought I'd buy a chrysler product and really loved my VW, but there were a lot of things that needed fixing and with a new baby I wanted something safer for her.  I test drove the Japanese and Korean vans and I can't see why anyone would pay 2X as much for one of them. Stow and Go is the single greatest feature.  I've already hauled full sheets of plywood in the van and also carried 7 people on a moments notice. We'll see what happens in terms of reliability but I've driven 2 1000 mile trips and it's been great.",Stow and Go can turn it from a people hauler to a truck in seconds.  So much more versatility than an SUV or even a truck.  I also added a tow hitch for a trailer so now I'm set.  The DVD player and mygig are a lot of fun.  Never thought I'd need them but I like it.,"For any automaker out there, Bring back a camper minivan like the 80's VW vanagons.  I want a poptop so I can easily sleep 4 in the van.

4,Best bang for your buck,jsklyar ,08/18/2009,,,4,4,4,5,,3,4,4,4,"I mainly purchased this vehicle for spacious cargo and also ability to haul 7 people. Car looks nice as well. Of course, generous incentives helped as well. So far, the vehicle is top notch, no complains. Drove on a highway and averaged 26mpg, about 18.5mpg in the city. Though, several things I wish this car would have: daytime running lights (even my old Astro had it), interior lights can only be lit up all at once. Basic engine is somewhat weak but I did not purchase this to win races. Cheesy green light readouts, it is time to join 21st century. No instant mpg, too bad.  Seats fold into the floor: excellent idea.  Go get one today!","Stow-n-go seats, visibility, good mileage, comfortable seats, lots of interior room.","Daytime-running lights, cheesy green light readouts, instrument cluster warning lights should not be in the middle, move them out left or right.

I would have preferred the styling of the Chrysler Town and Country, but this was better bargain because it came with so many extra features, including one I didn't especially want--the 3.8 engine.  I noticed a few days ago that the rear seat back have rust stains on them. We have had absolutely nothing in the rear well that could have done that. Under each stain, I can feel some sort of metal bar, which I believe may be the source of these ugly discolorations. I will check this out with my dealership the next time I go in for service.","The Stow and Go feature is amazing, although it is a bit of a hassle to stow the middle seats because the front seats have to be slid all the way forward to do it.  Interior lighting is nice. I really like the dashboard design. The jury is still out on the dashboard-mounted shifter.","In my opinion, the gas mileage is poor. While it is rated at 16 city and 23 highway, our mixed driving has never resulted in anything better than 16.5 mpg. We have yet to take an open highway trip, which, hopefully, will be a bit better.

5,BEST VAN IN 25 YEARS,ETP ,03/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the 4.0 with leather and sport suspension with 17"" wheels. Anti sway bars in the back and front as well as anti dive and lift. Very well built quality vehicle.","everything, just can'r seem to get it away from my wife","none, stay in business"
5,BEST OF 25 YEARS OF VANS/4.0 6 speed,ETP ,03/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is the best Caravan yet and we have 7 in the extended family. The only thing that would be nice is if the drivers seat would lower all the way to the floor. very nice workmanship and a very tight vehicle. I am a mechanic and drove several of these before buying the 4.0. My daughter did too so get one while you can folks.,"Quality, power, smooth shifting, nice firm but comfortable ride. Leather, AC,and power doors rock.",Drivers seat needs to lower further.
5,4.0 WITH 6 SPEED,ETP ,03/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5," My minivan looks great inside and out, and has a rock solid build. The van seems to be rock solid on the road also. Dodge has been doing this for 26 years folks and they got it right again. As  a former mechanic I check a vehicle out before I buy and this was far superior to the 3.3 and 3.8 vehicles on the lot. 12 months from now I can update this for you folks with long haul driving. I was reluctant to buy during this crisis but strongly feel we should support our manuafacturing base and most likely the worst that will happen is a reorganization of the industry.

4.75,Great to drive,Daren ,03/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"This van has a 3.3L/E85.  Wish it had the bigger motor, but it does not come with the E85.  This van as a lot of toys on it.  DVD, MyGiG, Sirius radio. Took our first trip with it.  Kids loved the dvd plater, mom and dad had the sirius radio on.  This has back up camera on it.  It also has the ESP on it.  Great in the snow. It comes with a speed stick. Could not resist Dodges 0% financing and employing pricing and other rebates.  Bought a $29k for $16k.  Last van was a merc with a 4.3L, had more power.  ","The entertainment system is great. Back up camera, Sirius radio, free for a YEAR, stow and go seating.  Dual temp controls in the frount, middle and rear.","Wish I could reset the mpg.  If you want the int. light on in the middle, you need to turn all on.  Still new, getting use to all the toys on it.  "
4.375,Great Deals To Be found On this Vehicle!,dlake ,03/03/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,3,4,"I cannot believe I got over 10K off on an SXT- loaded! I paid 19,095 for an MSRP of 29145.  5K below Edmunds Rx TMV!  Saved enough to purchase an extended warranty to 5/100K.    Also-48 months @ 0%.      Edmunds is giving this vehicle a bad rap especially given the unbelievable deals out there.   ",Roomy and excellent interior accommodations.  Every gadget you could possibly need for the road.,Offer a better extended warranty.
4.875,Not sure why the reviews are poor,Bradley ,03/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"This is a beautiful vehicle inside and out.  I don't see the ""seams not lining up"" or other problems listed in the other reviews.  Seats are a little hard in back but we test drove Kia, Honda, Toyota and they were similar.  Handling is responsive and the vehicle has a very nice feel -- solid but nimble.  Nice tight turning radius.  Ours has the rearview camera which is indispensible and should be on every car.  Very quiet on the highway.  The DVD with wireless headsets are awesome.  This vehicle has a lot of space and great fuel economy for a larger van.  ","Great traction control in the snow for a minivan (I live in Canada), awesome entertainment package, stow and go very easy, side windows that come down, lots of space.  With recent troubles we scored this van for 20,000 Canadian!","Seating could be more comfortable in back.  Don't like that the spare is under the middle of the vehicle, but that's the sacrifice for stow and go.  "
2.625,"Poor quality build, lackluster drive",cmac ,02/19/2009,,,4,4,1,3,,2,2,3,2,"This is a kind of no frills Grand Caravan that retails for around 25k. The drivers window sticks, you have to slam almost every door for them to shut properly. You can actually see how things don't line up around the door seams. It handles very stiffly. It has a nice design inside and out but the plastic inside makes it cheap looking. This is a company car and it will be put through its paces. The tranny won't hold on a hill, it rolls backward. The driver seat is very uncomfortable. I got caught in the snow and it slid around like a big sled. I was actually very concerned i would wind up in a ditch. I won't take it out in the snow again. Seems a bit underpowered.","Looks great for a van inside and out. Except for the cheap plastic wheel covers. Stow and go is a great feature, everything folds down flat and the van gives you plenty of room, especially in the back seat area.",Better build quality. Everything seems so cheaply done. more standard features in the base models. Everything must be extra because it really didn't come with much.
5,Awesome vehicle,Dave ,02/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This minivan not only looks great inside and out, the solid feel when driving it is very assuring when hauling the family. The van seems to be rock solid. Dodge is the king when it comes to minivans. I have driven the competition, and the versatility and quality of this vehicle far surpasses the others. I don't understand why the editors rating is as low as it is for this van. I highly recommend this vehicle.","Stow and go seating, indirect interior lighting, DVD system, mygig radio, inferno red color, 17"" wheels, 4.0L engine, 6 speed trans, leather seating, removable console, power lift gate, many cup holders",Still trying to come up with one.
3.75,Not as bad as Edmunds makes out to be.,Keith ,02/02/2009,,,3,4,4,4,,4,4,3,4,"I have the 4.0 liter engine, plenty of pep.  Using auto-stick makes for spirited accelerations if needed.  Edmunds says the rear seats are uncomfortable, they're nothing compared to a Tahoe which we traded for this vehicle. Interior space is also much better organized then the Tahoe. Interior is typical Dodge though, hard angler plastics. Bought this van because wife and I needed a good kid hauler.  So far this is fitting the bill much better than our 07 Tahoe did. I'm 6ft, with a 2.5 year old sitting behind me, I can extend seat all the way back with room to spare. Couldn't resist Dodges 0% financing and employing pricing and other rebates. Basically bought a $39k van for $30k. ","Entertainment system is incredible. Dual video screens which can play independent of each other. Sirius radio/tv  I actually enjoy driving this thing! Rides very smooth, little rough going over bridge/road seams though. Great highway cruiser. Looking forward to our first family trip.","Better fuel economy. Need to change interior materials and styling. Exterior styling is growing on me. Vehicle is still new, to early to comment on reliability.  "
4.875,"2009 Grand Caravan, Wow!",jon ,01/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,Love to drive this vehicle. This is the most usefull vehicle I have ever owned. My wife and I replaced our truck with this van and now we have the best of both worlds. The 4.0 V6 has plenty of power and the 6 speed automatic is smooth as silk. We have grown to appreciate a quit ride as we've gotten older and this van delivers.,"Never seen so many gadgets to play with in my life. We have wireless internet, MyGiG with DVD and Navigation, Bluetooth.  This van may not even need me in it to drive it.",Only suggestion would be to make the power rear stowing seats a little bit faster.
