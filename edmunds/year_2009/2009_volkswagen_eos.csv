4,Great Little car,K F ,07/07/2016,4,2,3,,,3,4,5,4,,,This car is fun and great on gas.  It has a zippy S-transmission that gives you the feel of a manual with the ease of an Automatic.  It didn't come with an owner's manual so I am not sure how to use many of the entertainment functions which is frustrating.  The interior is leather which gets VERY hot in the summer.  The interior was used well and I am adjusting to the missing pieces.  I love how this car drives and love the convertible/sunroof option.  The dealership I purchased from gave me a good deal and I would buy from them again!,,
5,Problem free for 50K miles!,rcboater ,03/25/2014,4,3,5,,,5,4,4,5,,,"Bought my car new in May 2009.Car is now five years old, and we've put 50,000 fun-filled miles on it.MPG is pretty good, too. On the highway, I get 32 MPG.In my mixed suburban driving,I will get about 28 if I drive normally,but have gotten as high as 35 on the same route by driving conservatively.My car has never leaked- but I paid heed to the advice on the owner forums to lubricate the roof seals annually, to keep them soft and pliable. (That's a 20 minute job.)  I've had NO issues with the mechanical aspects of the car-- to date, the only thing outside of regular scheduled fluid changes was new rear brake pads at 31K miles.UPDATE:  Now up to 68K miles, all still good.   Rear brake pads again at 60K. My only real complaint with the car goes back to how VW packaged the options in 2009.   Back then,  to get the leather seats and steering wheel audio controls, you had to buy the Lux, which meant you got an automatic.   I wanted the manual, which meant I had to have the Komfort, which couldn't have those other options.     I do love my manual Tx-  so it was the right choice, but I wish VW had been more flexible in the optioning.UPDATE:  Now up to 72K miles. all good.",,

2.25,Worst Car Ever ,jlmurray81 ,07/21/2011,,,3,3,1,1,,3,3,1,3,"I leased this car back in August on 2008 and have had nothing but problems with it and the dealership ever since. Four weeks after I leased the car, a transmission valve had to be replaced. I learned about his problem only after nearly being killed on the freeway because my car lost all forward momentum. To add insult to injury the dealership insisted it was my starter that caused this issue. Only after speaking to a mechanic was this issue actually addressed. The dealership had my car for over three weeks and tried to charge me for the rental car. Approximately a year later the manufacture issued a recall for this transmission value issue. ",,"On extremely hot days the navigation/radio will randomly turn off and not come back on, this issue has happened three times which requires a trip to the dealer to be rebooted each time. I rarely take this car on any trip over 100 miles as I am concerned with the reliability. Most recently I took the car on a 250 mile trip and sure enough the Malfunction Indicator light illuminated on our way home. We did everything the manual suggests to address the MIL. Upon our return the car started to idle very rough and the transmission would kick when slowly climbing up hills. We dropped the car off at the dealership at the night drop. Only after calling four times through out the next day did I find out that the exhaust manifold flaps had to be replaced? The dealership had the car for two days and didnt offer me a rental car. All of these issues were covered by the warranty; however, I have left my car with the dealership for over a month during my 36 month lease. I only have 27k miles on my car and I dont even trust it to get me to and from work, which is 7 miles from my home. "
3,DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION,BOCA LEN ,11/13/2010,,,3,3,3,1,,4,4,2,4,"Overall my EOS is a reasonably priced convertible with generally good quality.  I bought the car new. I drive to work and never abuse the car - just basic transportation  However, at 1400 miles the transmission blew and had to be replaced with what I now know is a refurbished unit.  Last week at 10,000 miles the refurbished transmission blew again.  The dealer wants to replace with a refurbished unit again.  VW extended the warranty, the dealer has been pleasant to work with and provides a loaner car. The point is, this transmission is too complex. I thing that anyone considering buying a VW with this transmission needs to be aware of the problems that are inherent with this unit. Beware!",drop top,"VW needs to find a decent transmission to put into these cars.  Simply covering them under warranty does not ameliorate the hassle and inconvenience of continually replacing the transmissions which self-destruct every 10,000 miles.  (at least for me)"

VW let me out of my lease for a ridiculous amount and I got a EOS.  I had tried the Toyota, Sebring and a few others but loved the handling of the EOS.  It's fun, no problems, lots of compliments.  Most fun driving ever. The back seat is small, but deep and bigger then the Volvo, Lexus etc..  I always get compliments on the car.  It's been so much fun. Great for road trips to the beach.

Last year I went to look at a VW Passat and left with a fully equiped EOS. I and my kids are thrilled. I have a hard time keeping my car keys in my hand my four boys take it every chance they get. It by far is the best car I ever had not a lot of back seat leg room nor storage but runs great with nice get up. Would recommend this car to anyone who doesn't have to load their family in their car anymore.,hard top and ease of converting it. Radio sound is tremendous and has good speed and steering.

We bought 2 VW's on the same day, an Eos & a CC. The Eos has been such an unpleasant experience it will be the last time a VW is owned in our family. 1st time and last time for a VW for us. Ignition, electrical,turbo problems.",The sunroof/convertible is an awesome feature. The front seats are very comfortable. The backseats are a different story (see below). Love the nav system too.,Quick release to access the backseats would be nice. The slow moving electric seats is annoying & then difficult to get in the back. The back seats are pretty much non-functioning. The Navigation system needs to be recessed so you can see the screen when you have the top down. 
4.75,New leftover 2009 EOS,Jeff ,03/26/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"We bought this along with a new 2010 Golf tdi. So far we have about 3000 miles on it, and it has preformed well. Most surprising is the relatively good fuel economy. Overall we have posted 29.8mpg with a high of 36mpg, and this is winter and the car has a ways to go before fully broken- in. We picked up the car for $26,600 or $5700 off MSRP. It's still too early to tell how this car will turn out but so far it is good. The only drawback is the weight of 3500 lbs, but all convertibles are heavy, and this is one of the lighter ones. Cornering although acceptable is not as crisp as lighter German cars. This is our first convertible, so we'll have a better idea after our Wisconsin summer.","The CSC, coupe/sunroof/convertible is really nice. The car is remarkably quiet, very comfortable seating and reasonable rear seating. In addition, it's a nice looking car. The motor and manual transmission excel, love the power and fuel economy. Economy so far is much better than the posted EPA.","A stiffer suspension would be nice, but the weight of 3500 lbs on a front wheel drive car has handling limitations. Would be better if it was a rear wheel drive car."
4.625,Nice car with a few hiccups,drspoon ,03/25/2010,,,5,4,4,5,,5,4,5,5,"This fun car is a dream to drive.    The turbo engine really gets up and goes.  We have taken the car on long trips and it is really very comfortable.  Now after having it for a year we find out the hard way that the engine is an oil burner after total 20k mileage.  Just got it back from the dealer where the oil consumption is one half quart per 1000 miles-- an amount that Volks says is acceptable.  I asked how I can make the 10,000 mile factory suggested oil change interval and the dealership simply says I cannot.  For the price of this car and the supposed quality of Volks engineering this is simply unacceptable.   No more Volkswagens for me!!!!!!!",Great acceleration and maneuverability.  We get up to 30 mpg on long trips so with today's gas prices this car will not break the bank.  The audio system and navigational systems are top notch.  The trunk is still large enough with the top down to carry most of the things we want on a long trip.,With no guard the sides are prone to dings from other cars.  And finally we just do not like the fact that we must carry oil with us to constantly top off the oil every other gas tank fill-up.  Oil consumption for this car is unacceptable.  Keep that in mind before purchasing  one!!

They have lived with the practical long enough and want something that makes no obvious sense. I think it is the most fun car I have ever owned and has the VW stamp of quality. No problems after 4000 miles of ownership and a trip of 2500 miles to Florida and back was super. No problem with trunk space, two bags consisting of one duffle and one regular was plenty for wife and I for one week. VERY comfortable and had no problems with power for passing or keeping up with traffic. Grandkids love the ""transformer"" and it gets lots of attention. Most people can't believe it's VW","Fun to drive, very classy and attention getting. Most people don't even know what it is until they see the VW on the trunk. Comfortable for long trips and fun to drop the top when the temp. is right. Hard top for winter. Feel very protected with top up, not like a cloth top vehicle. Very good MPG.","If it was bigger in back it would be nice, but it was purchased with the thought that it is a TWO person vehicle so why whine because because you can't haul your friends around. If it is too crowded, let them drive!"

I really was going back and forth on which car i wanted and test drove many and settled on the EOS and glad I did.  The interior is excellent I do wish the back seat had a little more leg room but I don;t plan to sit in the back. the Stereo system is tops and the control of the car is tops. i am surprised on how quiet it is when the hard top is on.....Great Car,Hard top and sun roof.....is out standing....and the wind screen really does work..

5,Very safe hardtop,Tristan ,12/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had this car for 4 months, nothing has gone wrong the build quality is amazing.  I recently flipped the car on Thanksgiving day, and the hardtop is very safe, only caved by about an inch to maybe 1 1/2 inches. The anti-rollbars popped up and if I hadn't had the top up I believe I would be just as fine.  Only got a couple cuts on my hands when getting out.  I highly recommend it just for the safety features even though the interior is amazing along with the engine.  I was hitting 36 mpg with premium on the freeway at an average of going 75 mph.  ","My favorite features was the convertible top, along with the panoramic sunroof.  I really appreciate having no buttons on my steering wheel.  Much better seats than the Jetta.","No suggested improvements, except that the HID lights I had were so great I would expect them to make them standard on every car.  Best lights I have ever had on a car.  Stereo was pretty good, but not as fulfilling as the Monsoon stereo on my old '02 z28 Camaro."
3.625,Avoid It - Traded Mine In,LR ,11/24/2009,,,3,5,2,1,,5,4,4,5,"53 days in the shop in the first year, finally had enough and traded it in for another brand.  Every imaginable problem with the electrical system, sensors, gas cap, abs, braking, fuel pump, air bag, among other problems.  Every little repair required shipping in parts so repairs took forever, and nothing fixed right the first time by dealer.  I owned the car for a little over a year and just took a huge loss on the trade, but it had to go.  Had trouble even getting near blue book on trade due to the car's reputation.  Did lots of research prior to buying and 07/08 models were well reviewed.  09 seems to be a disaster.  After 15 years driving VWs, this will be my last.  Very disappointing.","The 4 cylinder engine is powerful, acceleration is great, handling is very precise.  Top is extremely cool when it works.  The ipod adapter was ok.  Solid ride on the highway and around town.","At this price point, the car should have some basic things like audio controls on the steering wheel and bluetooth capability for phone.  I looked past these items when I bought it, but should not have.  Very annoying not having those basic features that I had even on Jettas I owned prior."
4.125,FUN LITTLE CONVERTIBLE,FLORIDA LEN ,10/20/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,3,4,"I was concerned about buying a hardtop convertible, but I bought the EOS knowing how well VW builds cars.  So far, early on in ownership, the car is solid and exhibiting no leaks.  The car is a good value for the money.  It is not a styling standout, but the design is nice looking.  The interior is typically German, all business.  What is great about the car is that is overall very solid, handles well and has decent mileage from a very peppy engine.  Although, a small car, it feels very safe and secure and I am glad I bought it.",I do love the whole top system with the sunroof.  I also like the fact that the engine is pretty quick even though it is a 4 cylinder.  Best feature is the radio - no funny buttons or things to pull or push just very straight forward radio controls.,"They need to improve on the window system in that it drops a little when you shut off the engine and if it is raining, it makes the interior wet.

For the money its worth it! I live in Michigan and i must say it turns heads, i love seeing the people in awe when i bold off the line! Also i get 25 mpg in mixed driving!

We continued our vacation in our brand new EOS and had a blast.  Consider it a 1200 mile test drive!  The person who wrote Edmunds review saying the car could not handle the twisties must be faking his reviews in my opinion.

The value compared to Saab, Volvo, BMW or Mercedes is outstanding.  Sebring?  Forget about it.",We skipped the $2000 navigation system and spent $200 at Best Buy for a portable TomTom system.  It is ridiculous that Volkswagen cannot make nav standard for a LUX model.  How much would it really cost?

The only complaint I've had so far is since I bought it towards the end of winter, I've noticed that when it drops below freezing, condensation builds up inside the car and freezes on the windows.

Comments: the top is amazing - attention getter - same as on much pricier models - mine works great & used a lot.  Moon roof great & huge for the car, handles on mountain roads well. Light car, acceleration to spare, good brakes, fun! Quiet ride (top up), sound system good for the price. Lots of people stop me to compliment/ask about this car - really.  And I live in a car lovin town.  That was a surprise.  Glad I saved that BMW money and got this sweet little ride.  Love it - recommend it highly.  Fun, good-looking, great convertible top. One thing, got hit in driver's door.  No repair parts are avail., so slow to get Euro parts at plant.","Great car for the money. Convertible Top is a blast & works great. Just plain fun to drive - I find myself smiling a lot, my not-leather seats are just as nice as the real deal & no one knows.  Handles very well, good looking, low read noise, seamless shifting (auto), gas mileage!","Note... I got the base model to save $ - Why not automatic headlights in 2009? Rreally. I miss my keyless entry - hard to go back,  no steering wheel controls but I must say controls are very easy to reach so have not missed it as bad as I thought.  Nothing major."
5,It's worth it! ,EOSEJIL ,01/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased my Black on Black fully loaded EOS in October and gave it much thought, it was totally the right choice.  I have read a TON of reviews on the '07-'09 and here are tips for those who have had issues.  You need an excellent dealer with VW fans in service, the prep work needed on this car is extensive.  I test drove several and only two dealers seemed to have it prepped right.  My car has no issues at all.  Also you cannot wash this car under 40 degrees or you will mess up the seals, plain and simple.  If you do not have a garage I would not buy an EOS.  You have to be patient with the car, the window move to get in and out be gentle.  '09 DVD Nav is worth it too if you drive a","Trunk is really great, I have fit so much into it.  The top of course. The sound system is really good. My EOS has very little road noise at all, with the top up of course. Great on snow and ice. In good weather (over 40) 31 MPG city/hwy heavy traffic, now 25. All the bells and whistles!",It drives very well except for the initial acceleration could be smoother. But once you get used to it you can get it going super fast.  Turbo is amazing on expressways.  One more storage compartment would be groovy but it keeps me from using my car as storage. LOL 
4.5,"Great functionality, poor driving",swissre ,11/05/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,3,5,5,4,"After almost 3 months of owning a new EOS I am still happy with the functionality of the sunroof, it has good torque throughout the RPM range even compared with other turbo engines, it has very good speakers but lousy sound unit (premium) but the worst for me is how it drives. You have to be really delicate to avoid the car spinning like crazy when you start. I have the upgraded 17'' wheels with Continental tires and that has helped little. So at the end it dissapoints because the engine is great and the DSG gearbox is amazingly smooth but the car is not sitting on the road as it should and can become dangerous because of the big torque it has for its size.","DSG, torque throughout engine's range, sunroof, speakers quality",Poor driving characteristics 
4.875,I love this car,Cindy ,10/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I love this car.  I have a new 2009 color-gold/silver, not the official name, it is beautiful.  Everything works well, very quiet and I get lots of looks.  I love having the moon roof so I have a great sun-overs car all year.  The only thing I don't like, is the movement of the windows after you turn the car off- they go down a little before rolling all the way back up.  This is bad in a rain storm.  I would recommend this car to anyone who had considered buying a convertible.  It is better than a convertible with the sun roof!  It gets great gas mileage so I don't mind the premium gas.",convertible top with the sun/moon roof,correct the window issue
5,Very pleased,CCP ,10/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Sorry there are ""lemons"" . Fortunately, I am one of the lucky ones. I have been in search of a convertible for close to a year.  I knew I wanted German technology, retractable hard top, front wheel drive if not all wheel,and some updated technology like a navigation system and ipod adapter. What you can get loaded in this car is a just a starter price in BMW or Audi.  Audi does not yet make a hard top and BMW does not have front wheel drive in the class. The retractable hardtop has a panoramic sunroof that opens..the only convertible with this feature.  They have corrected the ""whirring""with small windscreen above he windshield. Technology of top closure:priceless. Gas OK.",Retractable hard top with panoramic sun roof that opens.  Windscreen above windshield detracts noise. Navigation system has full media capabilities.,"Built in bluetooth, now a purchased accessory."
5,You get what you want,Jeff ,10/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The car is very fun to drive.  I have never had a convertible in my life so I was not to happy when she brought it home.  I figured it is her car and she will be the one driving it so get what you want.  She loves it.  The handling is good and speed is fine.  Does it have wind noise.  What can you expect when the top comes off.  Great car overall,The top,Steering wheel controls would be great but I can easily reach the controls
2.5,Do not buy this car! ,JLM  ,10/02/2008,,,3,4,1,1,,1,4,3,3,"I purchased a 2009 VW EOS 8/30/08. On 9/29/2008 a valve that measures the clutch temperature malfunctioned. If the clutch is too hot ""safety measure"" the car cant change gears. This malfunction occurred while I was on the freeway; I was almost hit by a semi trying to pull to the side of the road. It was like I put it in neutral and revved the engine, every light in the car flashed indicating a problem. I was initially told that my problem was a faulty engine switch. This diagnosis didnt make sense. I had to demand to speak with the head mechanic for my concerns to be taken seriously. This value malfunction also causes a pressure problem in the transmission. I have contacted a lawyer.","Affordable hard top convertible, but it would be much nicer if the car ran properly.",Make sure that these cars are safe for people to drive. I was nearly killed due to my situation and then the dealership treated me poorly until fully diagnosing the problem. I have only had my car for 4 weeks and the dealership will most likely have it for 2 weeks. Do not buy this car!
4.25,Total Fun Car!,Steve ,06/12/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,4,5,"I've always wanted a hard-top convertible ever since I saw one two months ago.  I generally assumed that it would be way out of my price range, but when I found out that Volkswagen made a hard-top convertible, I was totally 'hoodlumed'.  It turned out to be not only very reasonably priced but it drives and handles really well.  People will also be very surprised by the roominess of the rear seats.  The back is definitely big enough to hold two average sized dwarfs or a couple of medium sized farm animals.  My automatic transmission shifts very smoothly and the engine definitely holds its own on the highway.  Overall, this car is a pleasure to drive.    ",This drives like your typical volkswagen - with nimbleness and class.  Mileage is pretty decent for a fun car.,"I wish it had a small cooler that you see on some minivans.  It would be nice to put my cold drink and chocolate somewhere.  Otherwise, I wish the Volkswagen engineers found a way to put a moonroof when the top is down.  "
