The alternator went out right after I purchased it. I think everything has just been normal maintenance though and I have no idea how it was driven prior to my purchase. Overall it is a very comfortable car and has lots of storage in it. I get between 20 mpg in town and up to 26 miles per gallon on the highway. Mine is a 4 wheel drive vehicle.  My matrix got 30 miles to a gallon after it had 200,000 miles on it and 42 miles to a gallon new.  It was a 2005.  I enjoy driving this car. Other than regular oil changes I have only had the alternator repair so far.",,

3.25,Not sure what all the hype is about,villagefish ,01/01/2015,,,3,3,3,5,,4,2,3,3,"The RAV drives more like a dune buggy than a 21st century vehicle and leaves an unrefined impression not generally associated with a Toyota (I have owned two other Toyota vehicles). 

 The 4 cylinder engine is very loud and road noise is pronounced. I can hear suspension, wind, and tire noise at even the lowest speeds on newly paved surfaces.  The ride is stiff and the steering feels artificially weighted. Throttle response is jerky, especially at low speeds. 

The lack of a rear bumper is a safety concern and the side hinged tail gate is inconvenient. I think this vehicle is cheaply made and not worth the high used vehicle price it commands. Suggest looking elsewhere.  ",The front and rear seats are roomy.  Cargo space is generous.  Braking performance is good.,"More insulation from road, wind engine and tire noise.

Rear-seat room is significantly improved, as is cargo room, and it is great for families with children and pets. The only disappointment for me is the ride.

The interior is very functional--the back seats slide forward and back, and they split so you have more cargo options. I like the MP3 jack in the center armrest, and there's a little niche there that's perfect for an iPhone.

The independent suspension decreases body roll over uneven pavement. Road noise for a vehicle of this size is more than acceptable. Braking is smooth & quiet.

The 4cyl is smoother when accelerating, and powerful enough when needing to pass on the highway.  The leather seats are nicely cushioned in the front, but the rear seats are much more firm, making long trips surely less comfortable.  I notice some road noise when traveling on the Interstate, but with the radio on I barely hear it.  The ride is tremendous, as the suspension absorbs  bumps well.  Cargo space is awesome, including the hidden compartment for added space. Even with JBL upgrade, FM radio reception is still just okay, but XM satellite reception is much better.","Love the dual glove compartments! 4cyl acceleration is smooth and plenty powerful, suspension is great, interior comfort is excellent in front seats with plenty of leg room given that I am 6'1"".

Ride quality feels solid but engine noise is very evident for the first few gears and once we pick up speed >40 miles you can hardly hear a hum. I chose the Rav4 over CRV, just because it offers a v6 option and Honda doesn't.

For some reason I didn't understand how to get the hill ascent control working.,"2nd row seats can be folded flat with levers provided near the rear door, but, they seem too flimsy and I am doubtful that they might break if I repeat using them few more times.

The Rav4 handled in a predictable and well mannered fashion, but when rolling over rough pavement, you know you are not riding in a sedan. Some road noise was also evident at slow speeds, possibly due to the larger 17"" (steel) wheels that came with the Value Pkg. The wife found the Rav4 a bit better to her driving sense than the CRV we test drove. The only complaint so far is the audio system (muffled).",Utility of the cargo area and ease of handling.

Similar driving dynamics & lots of road noise & booming exhaust. In the morning the tranny has an annoying 2-stage takeoff from park, it engages 3/4's then full lock even when rolling. Once warmed up the hiccup goes away.  Although the interior dashboard is not as cleverly designed as a CRV (not enough cubby compartments) the center armrest/console is a welcome feature. The rear side doors have only a molded cup holder for a small H2O bottle. The back door is a disappointment too. Just a fishnet and no cubby holes molded in the door like the CRV.   Audio loudness feature is good because of the road noise.

If you had to choose only one vehicle to transport a family, haul furniture and find its way through inclement weather this compact to mid-size SUV is tough to beat.  There is some comfort loss in exchange for space, especially in the rear seat. The cushions are rather flat and don't provide much support so make sure those that will inhabit the space take a test ride.  Road and wind noise isn't in the luxury class but it is livable especially when you consider the relatively light weight of the vehicle vs. the size.","I personally like the style of the vehicle, the 4 cyl. engine provides adequate thrust, the hidden space where the spare tire normally resides is a bonus and I would recommend the rear backup camera integrated into the rearview mirror. Locking 4 wheel drive will be handy in Ohio winters.",Front seats could use more lateral support and the silver trim needs to be toned down as it is too reflective.

I'm also looking forward to the 4WD and added weight this winter.",I love the fast acceleration this vehicle has.  Merging into traffic on the highway is never an issue.  I also like the IPod jack. The seats are reasonably comfortable.  Perhaps the best feature is the room for the backseat passengers.  The cargo room in the rear is also impressive.,"Probably my biggest complaint was the lack of color choices the Rav4 comes in for the base unit.  I would have preferred additional choices.

","The steering wheel audio controls and steering wheel blue tooth controls provide great convenience and safety.  You can talk on the phone without actually touching your cell phone or bluetooth ear piece!  Also, the rear seats fold straight down to the floor just by pulling a lever.","When you put the rear seats down, the rear floor could be a bit smoother to give more comfort for our dogs.

The cornering is fairly tight for an SUV and the acceleration is phenomenal with the V6... I have no problem zipping into small spaces.  I love the fuel economy, too (averaging 22.5 mpg in Central NJ).  The keyless entry/ignition is so so so convenient and awesome, too.","AC outlet in rear.  Tremendous cargo space!  Comfy seats.  Adjustable rear seats.  Minimal blind spots, great visibility.  Responsive handling. Smooth ride.  Lots of little storage places for things.  Tons of cup holders.","The rear doors' hinge angle isn't the same as on the front doors, sort of weird when you don't close them right.

The Rav4 was a pleasant surprise. I never thought I would fall in love with a small SUV. The ride is smooth yet powerful with the V6 engine. I'm averaging 23mpg which is a big step up over the 15 I was getting before. Handling is superb, although the electronic assisted steering takes some getting used to. At 6'1 space is an issue for me and I have plenty in the Rav4. I have a ton of shoulder, leg and head room and the storage bins under the cargo area are a nice feature.

The quality of the materials appears to be excellent - I have perforated leather and heated seats. The smart key entry is wonderful since I just leave my keys in my pocket for entry and starting the vehicle. I do not find the swing door on the back to be a problem at all as it opens widely for easy access.  The rear step bumper is also handy.

We live in a rural area of PA and are getting 28 mpg.  On our first 12 hour trip, we got close to 30 mpg.  We find the leather seats very comfortable and enjoy the bluetooth phone capabilities....no more worries about getting the phone up to the ear! Keyless entry is nice but can be confusing.

We had to have 4WD and seating for six, but we wanted good mileage too.  After two years of reviewing cars, we got a RAV4.  The V6 eats up mountains without straining the transmission.  There's a bit of a 'turbo' lag as the transmission gears down, but then the RAV4 jumps past cars when passing.  Same engine as the Highlander in a much lighter SUV.  Wow.  Backdoor and wheel are same as on our Jeep; not a big issue for us.  Where else could the full-size spare go? Having a full-size spare is important.

The interior is wall-to- wall plastic with no soft areas.  The push button glove box is kind of quirky and small.  The center console that houses the radio looks and feels like something from a K-Mart appliance center.  The fuel filler door is riveted on and has the feeling it is going to be pulled off if too much pressure is exerted.  Car is relatively slow.  I should have leased the Jeep Patriot or Ford Escape.

After 2 tanks of gas I am averaging about 26 mpg with mixed highway and city driving in the RAV. Gas mileage going down the interstate is best when I cruise at 65-70 mph. To me and my wife there was not a huge difference between the 4 and 6 cylinder models performance and as such we did not want to fork over the extra cash. The interior on the Sport is far nicer than the base model for not much more money. The only thing I wouldn't mind having is the 4x4 as our Highlander was AWD and that worked great in bad weather. Overall very happy with the RAV.","Interior design and color, Gas mileage, nice performance for a 4 cylinder and it does not feel like the motor is being over worked.

With 2 small kids we were truly looking for a used Pilot or Highlander (for 3rd row).  But with my 05 Forester lease coming due we ran out of time finding what we wanted in our price range.  So I decided on a 3 yr lease of a Rav4 Limited and I AM SO HAPPY!  I've only had it for 3 days but at least at this point I could totally see myself buying it at the end of the lease.  It's comfortable, roomy, handles wonderfully, and is lovely to look at.  Went with Pyrite Mica color with gray leather & love it.  I was concerned about comfort but with the pwr & lumber it's great.  Average 24 mpg so far.","Height while driving, bluetooth, XM, gas mileage, pwr driver seat, spacious rear seat & cargo area, adjustable rear seats, moonroof, auto lights, smart key, roof rack.  No issues with the size of cup holders as others mentioned.

I was actually leaning towards the Honda CR-V when I first started looking, but the Toyota won me over with its better gas mileage and roomier interior. A lot of thought went into laying out the interior, and build quality was very good. I wasn't too sure how a 4 cylinder engine mated to an automatic transmission would perform, but it has more than enough power for daily driving, although I still would have liked to have a manual transmission.  Unfortunately, being best in class comes at a higher price tag. Total out the door cost for a sport package was $23.5K as of June 2009.","Very good gas mileage for this class vehicle, 2.5 engine surprisingly peppy.

It's uncomfortable, poorly designed and has a rough ride.  The interior looks cheap and has asinine places for cup holders.  The fact that this car has a keyless ignition is, in my opinion, a nightmare.  I find myself losing the keys like crazy because there's no specific spot for them.  The rav also has a very jerky ride to it-not so great when riding with passengers who suffer from car sickness.  The back door opens outward as opposed to upward-another stupid feature for obvious reasons.  I could go on and on but to sum it up: it's awful!!         ",Heat seaters-but even those are on timers which I dislike.,"Where do I start?  Get rid of the ridiculous tire on the rear door and have the door open upward, enough with the seatbelt reminder that beeps annoyingly, comfortable seating would be a huge improvement, bring back an ignition for the keys...or better yet- discontinue this vehicle altogether.

At 131km it had its first visit to the shop with the A/T Oil indicator light illuminated.  It took three more trips to the shop to fix the problem. Now at 3000km it is back in the shop with AWD, slip control, and engine indicator lights on. It has also failed to start and down shifts with the grace of a new driver in a standard transmission car.  I am getting absolutely no help from Toyota Canada or the dealer that I bought this lemon from.

4.75,Fun to drive but too noisy,SUV lover ,03/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"This new SUV is indeed fun to drive. I couldn't wait each day to drive it. 4 cycler engine still has enough power making acceleration sharp. So, everything is good except for one thing: too noisy when accelerating. I found the noise is not coming from engine but from poor insulation or design of exhaust system. I recommend the manufacture should recall to replace this noisy system with quite one. I feel strongly that once this noise issue is solved, the RAV4 4X4 base model can be the best selling SUV in the world and people will love it even more. Sincerely hope the manufacturer will listen to our voices.  ",,Key improvement is to reduce road noise. The noise seems coming from exhaust system or poor insulation.

My previous experience was a much heavier LR Discovery V8, and RAV4 performer better, thanks to light body and very well designed transmission. The interior everything are very well resolved, but the material looks cheaper, even leather trim is not first class. There are excessive noise in cabin, combined from engine and road. Update, combined millage is 21mpg, not bad for a I-4 AWD, but I don't think I'll get promised 27mpg freeway.","Back seat controls, quick access from trunk. Very stable and soft cruise-control.

4.375,Rav Sport; the GTO of SUV's,Don  ,03/21/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"We checked them all out; CRV's, Rogues, Outlanders and Tiguan, etc. All had their points.  We chose the Rav because of the build quality, the great lease deal, and the hot 265 hp V- 6 that gets mpg almost as good as the 4. It's really quick, with great handling; lots of fun to drive.  The Rav sport w/ the V-6 is the only Rav without a tailgate mounted spare. You get ""run flat"" tires instead.  We'll see how that works out. The Rav is a total package choice; I don't think it wins, hands down, in any one category but is a solid choice across the board, including great resale (if you purchase).  We were looking to get a little pizzaz in an otherwise functional vehicle; the RAV4 Sport 6 delivers.","build quality, fit and finish, the V-6 performance; reliability and resale",The dash design; center stack in dash is functional but not very classy.  Toyota's insistence on white light speedo and tach dials and amber backlit LCD gauges for everything else seems mismatched; a vertical lift tailgate and a way to eliminate the rear mounted tire w/o resorting to run flat tire.

After over 20 years of driving the entire range of only Ford SUVs, I made the decision to go Toyota, which I believe was a wise one. I just wish I did it years ago.  Going from an '05 Escape 6 cyl AWD to the '09 Rav4 4 cyl AWD, I expected sluggishness, but instead found it peppier with all-around better handling & performance in & on the VT snow & variable roads conditions.  Having to drive over 2.5 hours, several times per week to VT, I find the drivers side lumbar support & heated seats a godsend.  Gas mileage falls within the stated 21 to 27 mpg, with 24 mpg as my average. It should improve over time.     ","Perfect height tailgate seating for changing in/out of ski boots. Truly heated lumbar supported drivers seat & heated side view mirrors. Easily reachable roof rack.  Great turn radius, sound system, Bluetooth, double glove box, rear seat release latches, and actually everything.",Needs quieter heating/AC blower.

4.875,A Thrilling Ride,Kathy ,02/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,The Rav4 6 cyl. is a solid little car that is really fun to drive.  The car is comfortable with plenty of interior room and gives a sense of security to be able to pass with power to spare.     ,The smart key really saves a lot of hassle in that you never have to search for the key in your handbag.  You just have to have it in there somewhere to be able to open and start the car.  The Bluetooth is also very handy.    ,Ideally a garage door opener would be a nice addition.

We moved from a 95 Ford Windstar to this, so anything would have been better, but it really does handle and drive very well.  31 days later we were in accident. I was in the passenger side and took the brunt of the impact. It took a minute or so to figure out what happened. Air bags deployed, doors crumpled, but we were all completely fine.  Safety and crash ratings are very high from me, as the impact felt like nothing more than a little nudge (impact speed about 25mph).

4.375,2 WD Limited 4 CYL,David ,11/17/2008,,,5,4,4,4,,4,5,5,4,This car has been getting 28 MPG with mixed city and highway driving. The power is fine even with the 4 cyl engine. My last vehicle was a 2005 4Runner and the interior head room even with the moon roof is much better than the 4Runner. The Bluetooth hands free stereo is a must. The backup camera is a waste (too small). A back up beeping sensor is much more useful. The only quality issue I have found is a clunking sound shifting from reverse when the engine is cold. This appears to be a common problem with the Rav4. The interior room with the seats flat also rivals the 4Runner. The only thing the 4Runner does better is off road. By the way a 6 cyl 4Runner with 4 wheel drive averaged 20 MPG. ,Bluetooth Handsfree system and push button start.,5 speed transmission paired with the new 2.5L 4 cyl engine.

Handling is solid and predictable with a nice balance between capable SUV and commuting car (mostly commuter car).  There is huge internal room, but it is still quite quiet on smooth pavement. On rough pavement it becomes noisy pretty quickly.  The interior controls are all easy to use, but the steering wheel controls are not lighted at night so I will have to learn to blindly operate the Bluetooth controls. The radio controls on the wheel were easy to adapt to though.  The exterior is not much changed from older Rav4. Just a few cosmetic changes.","Built-in Bluetooth and XM radio. Reclining rear seats. Instrument cluster showing instant and average MPG. Dual-side climate controls. Smart-key keyless entry and Prius-like ""Start"" button.
