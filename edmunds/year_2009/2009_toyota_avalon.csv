5,I absolutely love to drive it!,David H ,06/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"When shopping for our car, we researched the purchase for a good year.  We took into consideration our age, our abilities (and disabilities), cost, maintenance costs, reliability, etc., and came to the determination that this was the best car for us to purchase. The 8-way power seats both driver and passenger were a must for us, and love the fact that both of us can maintain  max comfort possible.  When the wife's back is really hurting, she wants to go on a road trip, or just sit in the car to get it settled down! We get 26-28 MPG in town, and up to 34 MPG on road trips. The Limited with AC in seats was hard on the wife's knee replacement but wasn't worth the cost to get laser cruise. ","I love the JBL 6-disc stereo system (but a little loud for rear-seat passengers), 8-way power seats driver AND passenger w. lumbar support, good handling, smooth ride, almost flat cornering on curves, quiet ride, more than plenty of power for steep mountain hill climbing, and dual AC controls.","PLEASE allow the optional laser cruise control on other than the Limited version!

2.75,GPS Madness,Avalon Grandma ,06/04/2009,,,1,1,1,4,,4,4,4,3,The GPS is the worst.  Extremely user unfriendly.  Many important POI's are missing.  Per Toyota many were removed to make more map space.  Toyota admits that the Avalon has the original GPS designed for the 2003 model.  No wonder it is antiquated.  Toyota will not stand behind the device.  Says it was designed to specs. I've asked them to take the vehicle back and replace it with another without GPS.  They consistently refuse.  Suggested guidance for the same route varies.  Guidance for one route sometimes goes 15 miles out of the way.,Smooth highway ride.,Get rid of the GPS until they can get it right.

I just traded it for my 09 Avalon Limited. I would ask why buy a bottom end Lexus, this high end Avalon is perfect. The room in it is exceptional and it has all the comfort features you could want from a luxury car. The price points of Toyota are exceptional and have better negotiations than Lexus by far. Toyota warranties are not as good as Lexus but then they don't break either. Toyota, thank you for making such a GR8 car! I love it.",Everything in the Avalon Limited is my favorite.

Plenty of room for those long legs.  I have some back problems but these seats fit me just right so no problems.  Driving our gravel winter roads on snow, ice, slush gets us 26-27 mpg.

It is the most refined, the best handling, and the most comfortable. My car is loaded with everything, but the remote starter.  I noticed that handling on back, winding country roads is much improved over my 2006, and I have more road feel.  I happen to be a car nut, and an Older Gentleman, and this vehicle fills all of my current automotive desires.

The only thing I do not like is the hardness of the drivers seat. I can feel something under the padding, perhaps it has something to do with the seat's cooling feature. I have been driving around for the last 4 months with a thin quilt under me. This makes it more comfortable. Hopefully the seats will break in and I can take out the quilt.

The 05 could attain 32 highway, and on our first road trip with only 300 miles on the car (added 240 more miles on the trip) we got 33.9 mpg generally driving 70 mph.
