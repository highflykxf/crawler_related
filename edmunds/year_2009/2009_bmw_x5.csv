However, the frequency of my trips to the repair shop had both me and my mechanic frustrated, and diminished the positive feeling.

This car is no exception.  That being said I buy low priced, high quality cars. I prefer them depreciated from their showroom pricing, but in good condition. We bought our 2009 BMW X5 with 92K on it. In the last 24 months we have spent about 6-7K in repairs.  The car does need special therapy. The tight tolerances of the sensors, the tight standards of the brakes, tires, wheel bearings, and glow plugs mean constant mechanic massaging.  BUT!!!! When this car is running right(80% of the time) it is simply the best car I have ever driven.  Insanely fast, stable, and powerful. With snow tires I have conquered the toughest storms that Colorado can throw at me.  Do yourself a favor. Buy one of these cars with 90-100K on it, set aside $6K in repair dollars(that is still half of the original sticker price) and you will own a great car. A really great car.",,

5,People mover with class and performance ,cnaps ,09/29/2013,4,4,5,,,3,5,4,5,,,I must say the BMW X5 3.0 i x-driveis a excellent looking & driving suv. it's not X5m fast but perfect for everyday use. The cabin is very comfortable and build quality and materials are of the highest quality and also safety and the brakes are very good and drives very tight. It gives you the room you need to move the family around with out losing the performance and style. Build quality and reliability is as good as it gets. I have had many vehicles from different car manufacturers and all have needed parts and service. If you do your services on time which many people don't do with German cars you will be fine. Don't be fooled thinking other brands of cars or trucks don't need servicing or parts I say buy what you can afford and like and it won't bother you servicing it. And you need pay to play !,,

There aren't any issues with the diesel - its great! Plenty of power on the low end with good power at speed. The six cylinder gas engine is way underpowered. The V8 has great performance with terrible fuel economy. I am getting between 30 and 32 MPG on the highway and 18 MPG in local driving. Figure that you will average 22 MPG in combined driving.,"After the diesel engine my favorite features are the Heads Up Navigation Display, premium sound system, and the hidden trunk if you do not get the spare tire.

The thing corners like a sports car and feels soooo smooth doing 100mph on the straight.  Sound system is superb. You can hear the engine if the sound system is not on but it's not intrusive. I don't have the sport package with the expensive wheels so the visual is an understatement but the highway ride quality is actually a lot better without the fat tires...go figure. ,"The multi way adjustable seat is pure heaven to me.

4.875,"X5 Diesel Pros and Cons, mostly Pro",NorhternVA ,11/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"5,000 mile review: This vehicle is about compromise: V8 performance and SUV comfort with less pollution and  up to 30 mpg highway. But there's no mistaking that this is a diesel. You can hear the clatter at low RPM. BMW designed the X5 model with a loud exhaust note, mistakenly thinking that buyers equate noise with performance. Add the diesel's louder, gravelly engine note to the already loud X5 exhaust note and you get a noisy driving experience. It quiets down at highway speeds, but the exhaust noise is constant, intrusive, and can be annoying. In the first 5,000 miles, mpg was 24.5 mixed and 29.5 highway. Not bad for a vehicle that weighs over 2.5 tons and isn't broken in yet. This might be a good choice if you are willing to trade drive-train refinement for the comfort of an SUV that gets great mpg and pollutes less.

4.75,Love it but...,Scott in Austin ,07/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"While my 2009 X5 4.8i only has about 300 miles on it total I've got to say I wake up in the morning looking for places to go just so I can drive this awesome piece of machinery, and I work out of my house.  The Pros:  Awesome Handling, macho-good looks (especially with my 20"" y-spoke sport wheels), solid German engineering, thicker than average sporty steering wheel and powerful.  The Cons:  Beside the fact I have already had it in the shop for two full days due to two (conicidence? I think maybe not) bad front tires that was causing my car's steering to pull there aren't a whole lot of cons.  The i-Drive interface is a joke!  BMW has some work to do and could take some pointers from Lexus.",Those fantastic looking 35R20' wheels in the back!. ,The i-Drive interface needs to be improved. I'm surprised someone hasn't been in an accident yet trying to figure that out while driving.  It needs to be touch screen like Lexus.  Also the bluetooth phone ringer needs to ring louder when making a call. 
5,Even better than I first thought,I Offset ,06/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"A brief update on my initial (3/1/09) review of my X5 diesel:  Now at 5,025 total miles.  Average mpg now 21.1 -  even though average speed is only 28.5 mph (most of my driving is urban, much of that on the very hilly streets of San Francisco).  Most impressive of all - not one single thing has needed repair or even minor adjusting.  This is a first for me. Over the years I've been fortunate to have only had brand new cars,  never used. One VW, one Lexus, five Mercedes, two Range Rovers, and one Toyota. Loved them all in one way or another, but all had needed overnight stays in the shop at least twice or more at this point in their lives.  A BMW, made in SC, tops them all - amazing.",,
4.5,X5 Turbo Diesel (no 3rd row seating),Andrew ,06/15/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,5,4,5,5,"Had a 3.0 X5.  Test drove Audi, Lexus, Acura, BMW gas, and fell for performance of X5 diesel.  After 7,000 miles I am actually trading it in for MB ML350 diesel.  BMW just not as comfortable.  Seats not as supportive. Engine can be too loud. Satellite radio comes & goes.  Passenger seat grinds/clicks when moved. Steering wheel squeaks when moved. Rt side speakers go dead on iPod integration.  Need to roll the window up/down a few times to get speakers back. Steering wheel does not telescope long enough for 6-1 height.  Engine performance is incredible.  Second seat leg room is great.  Cargo space is great. Just want more refinement.  Maybe I am getting old.",Engine performance is phenomenal. The gas pedal is responsive at any speed. 26mpg hwy is real.  Handling is solid. iDrive system is easy and intuitive.  Plenty of cargo space for 3 ice hockey bags. Good second seat leg room.,"Engine insulation could be better. There is no doubt this is a diesel, but it is also supposed to be a luxury car. Longer telescope on steering wheel. LCD screen resolution is sub par. Nav sys street labels can be hard to read. Cup holders are in front of iDrive & gear shift. Std wheels too small."
4.75,Vermillion Red-Liner,AIA ,06/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,Bought a 09 Vermillion Red X5. These are rare and had to be custom ordered. I have owned X5's in the past and this is a great vehicle. It is fun to drive and handles great like a true BMW even though it's a heavy vehicle. It has all the options imaginable. Gas mileage is great for such a beast. ,"Voice activation, keyless entry and the fun to drive factor.","Faster processor for the iDrive, rear camera to engage quicker, Park Distance to be 24/7.  These are things that I am picky about. "

It also has an amazing crash test rating.","The i-drive system is great, it could not be better. I own a 2006 Audi A6 and its computer is easier to use than my 2007 BMW 5-series' computer but my 2009 X5's computer is easier to use than both of them.

4.5,"Very fun to drive, sucks gas",Brett 4.8i ,06/05/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,2,5,"I got my X5 less than a week ago and I love it. I saw the 2010 iDrive on a couple of other BMW models. I became afraid that I bought too soon before the 2010's came out. Hey this car handles awesome and is super comfortable. The fat wheel looks burly. I like the electronics and computer stuff. Sound system is way better than I expected, and I am a picky guy. I'm tired of Mercedes Benz and the way they treated me. When I got the X5 my blackberry connected easily with the bluetooth. With Mercedes, blue tooth only worked with Motorola and Verizon. That stinks, they went out of their way to make things more expensive and harder. BMW beats Mercedes in handling and steering in my book. Bye bye BENZ.","iDrive, Comfort seats, interior is awesome, panorama moonroof, light leather and black headliner and Bamboo wood, Junk compartment under floor in cargo area and this thing handles amazing and is smooth. Night and day from Mom's 2002 X5 (without sport package), better.",Better gas mileage. How do I turn off NAV guidance!!!! AAAHHHH shut up!!
5,Is this a SUV?,Spirited SUV ,05/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded my Mercedes GL450 because we wanted something slightly smaller, but not give up the utility, and luxury-comfort. The X5 hits that mark perfectly. It has sporty handling but is still luxurious and quiet. Gets 20 MPG which is great in my book. I'm 6'4"" and 300 lbs and am super comfortable in it, and... my kids have room in the second seats!","Nav, and sporty handling. Overall Luxo- feel to the interior.","Interior design.

I get 20 mpg in town, going long distance 35mpg.  Great torque, better going uphill than gas engine.  Better blue-tooth than previous years, have to let computer system boot...gives chance for car to warm up.  Get Rear- Climate package...didn't get like past X5s...should have been patient and waited.  My wife will be getting one when her 335 lease is up.  2 SUV family...best value and drive in its class.  Must get running boards to finish off the look.","Great cup holders, parking sensors & camera.  Comfortable.  Great pick-up off the line...better than both gas versions.

4.75,BMW 35d,eddiebrannon ,03/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I bought the 35d last week it is a great car, fun to drive and the interior is elegant yet contemporary.  The I drive with noted improvements, is still cumbersome and I have to duck my head to get into the vehicle.  The windshield is swept a bit too far back creating an entry obstacle. However I still highly recommend this vehicle as it is state of the art and well worth the price! Driving is a pleasure, the turbo diesel is responsive and zippy!  Ride is all you would expect from a car of this caliber. Cup holders are positioned well and there are plenty of auxiliary electronics ports. My wife doesn't care for the engine vibration at idle. The passenger climate controls are great. ",Seats are great I upgraded  to cooled seats so you get the sport seats which are fabulous.  The diesel engine is a joy to drive and connects the driver to the car. I averaged 19.7 mpg in the city.  I have yet to test the fuel efficiency on the HWY but expect it to achieve better than 26mpg displayed,Stand the windshield a bit higher to allow easier ingress and egress.  Clean up the I drive software. Improve mpg.  The running boards are placed a bit too high making them only an aesthetic rather than functional.  Put lower glove box back storage is essential! Reduce idle vibration. 
5,X5 diesel review,louis ,03/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The SUV while a little noisy outside is extremely quiet inside and comfortable with excellent power and very good fuel mileage. ,Fuel mileage average is 25+mpg average and is excellent.

4.875,Best Green SUV,I Offset ,03/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've led a double life for years. I'm a committed environmentalist,  and at the same time I'm an SUV lover. I love SUV's because I'm 6'4"", I'm claustrophobic, and I have a kid, dogs and a horse so I need to be able to haul a lot of gear. But I also totally believe that if we can't all reduce our carbon footprint our children's children will face some huge problems. So,  two years ago I traded in my Range Rover for a Mercedes ML 500, and last month I traded that in for the new BMW X5 diesel. I got 12 MPG with the Range Rover,  15.5 with the ML 500 (both on premium),  and so far (after 650 miles) I am getting 20.1 mpg on the X5. Not as good as a Prius,  BUT WAY BETTER TO DRIVE.",1. Super smooth ride/drive. ML tranny was jerky - not this. Felt every bump on my Rover and ML - not on X5.  2. Awesome seat comfort (have the fully adjustable ones). 3. Amazing torque. I live in SF Bay area; we have BIG hills;  X5 drives like I'm in KS. 4. I-Drive is EASY.,Nothing major. Just silly details:  1. Wish the exterior mirrors folded in automatically as one exits the vehicle.  2. Not sure why the rear view camera takes so long to come up on the screen after one shifts into reverse.
2.75,Dead Battery,Don ,02/14/2009,,,3,4,1,1,,4,4,1,4,"Huge problem with the battery system.  The push start system has no accessory mode, therefore if the engine is not running and you turn it on to use the radio, phone, DVD, etc.  The battery will drain in 15 minutes.  No indicator, no warning, just dead battery.  The dealer service departments say they have to put the car on a charger just to work on them or the battery will be dead.  The BMW answer is you have to have the engine running ""all the time"".  Forget the after engine turnoff heat, you can't use it.  Forget the DVD player that logically you can't use while driving, but you have to keep the engine running.  If you expect to use your car a lot like I do, forget it.",Great looks!,Solve the power problem.
5,Finally!,Hazbeen ,02/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've been a long time Porsche/BMW/Mercedes driver and this is by far the best all around vehicle I have ever owned. I enjoyed my M3/997 more from a pure driver's standpoint but I can actually carry my dry cleaning home now. The new X5 is a terrific package and the diesel power plant completes it nicely. I have wanted a proper diesel power plant in a daily driver for some time now as the advantages during a daily commute are obvious: torque while being fuel efficient and low rev requirements to get the job done. It feels as quick as the V8 powered X5, however provides guilt free driving while in view of my Sierra Club neighbors.","I like the high quality interior and while some believe the interior isn't flashy enough, I appreciate the form follows function approach. I believe it will stand the test of time where many new interior design in other automobiles will date themselves quickly. Fuel economy and thus, fuel range A+++","The center console is large however there are no obvious storage areas within that would allow eyes on the road searches. The iDrive is way cool, works wonderfully. The placement of the cupholders are a touch far forward... a minor nit on a terrifically executed vehicle."

The BMW 528i I had previously driven for years felt sturdier and safer than the Mercedes! So I chucked the Mercedes and bought the X5. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Mileage stinks but you expect that with a 4.8L engine right? Otherwise, it's a great car that drives like a sports car and yet it's luxury all the way!","Comfort access (a must!), automatic lift gate, heated seats, stereo, sports package, powerful engine yet smooth and light drive, iDrive (I actually like this a lot!).

The 2009 is much improved over the 2001 in terms of build quality.  The 2001 X5 did have mechanical issues.  I do miss the handling of the 330i but for a SUV, the 2009 X5 is as close as it gets!","Build quality, iDrive, navigation, backup camera, 3.0 inline 6-cylinder engine, transmission is like silk, I laughed at the auto tailgate but now I would not get an X5 without it.

Before I drove already the X5 3.0 I6 cylinder for 2 years and the X5 4.4 V8. The diesel engine fits that car best!! The torque is huge - no difference to the V8. The mileage is about 25 mpg, even in those days extreme winter temperatures. By the way I didn't had any winter problems so far.  The 2008/2009 update to the X5 is significant to the older models, e.g. more space in back row and trunk. Also remote trunk opener, keyless comfort entry, rear view camera are nice features.

This SUV has everything looks, speed, wow factor.  I love the iPod integration, navigation is very easy to use, I love asking for options in any menu and then I know exactly what to say to get anything done via Voice commands.

It was worth the wait. The diesel is very quite and drives like a dream. The torque is huge and available at any speed. The twin turbo diesel engine does a magnificent job. There is absolutely no lag at all. You punch it, and it goes. With that much power, you really do not need the big 4.8i. I was debating between the diesel and the 4.8i for the longest time, but now I am very glad that I went for the diesel. Picked up the x5 2 weeks ago with a full tank. Drove 500 km and still have more that quarter tank of fuel left. Fuel mileage, so far so good. ",Diesel is amazing. Quiet and very smooth. Lots and Lots of power.
