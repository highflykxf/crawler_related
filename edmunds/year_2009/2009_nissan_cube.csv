5,TAKE MY BMW please..,William Lee ,11/30/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"My 2000 BMW 323i was making everyone sad, except my auto mechanic. Listen, loved the look and ride of my BMW, but the cost of any repair even oil changes was ridiculous. Can you imagine a $120 oil change for a sedan? A new starter for $500? Radiator replacement $900? It's just stupid. My Cube gets me to and from work, it's clean, quiet and very fuel efficient. The BMW was too much drama and with the money I spent fixing it, I could have paid for my Cube. Lesson learned. Looking ""cool"" costs money and keeps you awake at night deciding whether to eat or fix your foreign sports car. Sorry, The Cube has lowered my stress levels and put money in my pocket--and it looks cool too without the drama!",,

5,I am super glad I made this purchase,Sherrie ,09/21/2016,,5,4,,,5,5,5,5,,,"From the outside of the Cube, it looks like it has decent space. But once you get in it, the amount of space it has is even more comfortable. I am 5 feet and a 1/2 inch tall and it fits me perfectly. I did not even have to get used to driving it because I fit right into it the first time around. I have to load up a wheelchair for my mom and it fits right into the back. The door on the back is not a hatchback like you'd expect. It has a door that opens up like a van, only it is one door making putting things into the back all that much more easy. The controls right on the steering wheel make it easier to stay focused on the road. I like how the cruise control technology works in it. In my other car it was more difficult to manage. I get nice gas mileage as well, just as good as my old car and yet I've got better space since my old car was smaller. The only thing I would have liked to be better was for the interior cosmetics to be a little more luxurious, but the overall design of the interior is well put together nice and sturdy making me feel that it will last for many, many years to come. So, this does offset not having the luxurious feel. However, the seats feel luxurious and they are well made and where the dashboard is for the mileage is pretty cool as well as the lights that you can light up at night at the bottom where your feet sit. I highly recommend getting a cube.",,

Lots of space inside. I travel a lot and rent many different cars, coming home to the Cube is very satisfying. Have stayed on top of maintenance. Keep a close eye on CVT fluid levels after a change.

Never been in the shop once for a repair, none of the cvt troubles or anything.  We are passing this car to my daughter now it has 88,000 miles and the interior still looks new and the outside is great looking and shinny with just normal rock chips and door dings.  We take good care of our cars, this has been my wife's favorite for a number of years now.  After reading several bad reviews about these cars I have to wonder if it isn't the owners more than the cars or maybe we just got the magic Cube that was built better than the rest.  Update car now has 97000 miles and my daughter is now driving it to school and yet to have a single problem with this car, no complaints period.  To bad they won't sell new ones in the states.",,

2,Poor quality - 2009 Nissan Cube 6 speed,may ,09/09/2015,,3,3,,,1,3,2,4,,,"I like the appearance of the car,  it looks refreshing and innovative.   However,  I knew the CVT would be a major headache down the road,  so I chose the 6 speed version.  Unfortunately,   other problems developed pre-maturely:  the muffler and the exhaust pipe fell off due to a rusted connection at 45000 miles,  5 years.  Replacing the entire assembly costs over $850,  I have never owned any car with the muffler system lasting only 45000 miles or less than 5 years,  and it costs so much to fix.   To add insult to injury, during the hottest days of the season this year,  the air conditioning failed.  This is a poorly made car,  with below average quality control. I believe this model was terminated last year.  Need I say more ?  But I have to say to myself,  beauty is only skin deep !!",,

Called the dealer and took it in for service. Diagnosis, a solenoid was not working properly.I have to have a brand new transmission put in the car. Yes it is under warranty, but still, this concerns me.So to everyone considering the Cube, do your research.

I drive it more than she does.  We took it from TN to FL, had a wonderful trip.  So far, it's been reliable.  Wheel covers are plain.

I have now been driving it for 5+ months, and I have 12,313 miles on it. It is a lot of fun to drive, sure it isn't fast but then again that's not the point of an econobox. I average about 31 mpg in mixed driving. Comfortable, ROOOOMY, and still gets a lot of attention both good and bad, I prefer the bad =D. I have had issues with the fuel gauge meter, had to be replaced, and it had to be realigned TWICE already. Brakes started screeching after 3,000 miles, but dealer will fix. All in all, it is a great buy, fun to drive, and am very pleased with my choice of car. ","Design, MPG, Turning radius is awesome, folding/ sliding seats. Radio works just great, but I do plan on upgrading audio system in the near future. Great visibility, and great for customizing. Suggested improvements start here: sun visors stink, big small mirrors w/ no lights,windshield is a BUG CATCHER","Well, I had previously mentioned in my first review that the sl package should be more affordable for the S trim, and guess what, they made it happen. Now for 2020 you dont have to pay $2000+ for bluetooth/steering wheel controls, 6 speakers/ iPOD integration! too bad I dont have those though."

I am so far averaging about 26mpg. I do have a lead foot, so this may affect the numbers. Love the sound system, keyless starter. Very roomy. Some wind noise at higher speeds on hwy.

I had researched quite a few smaller commuter cars and this is the only one I found that had any SPUNK! Spending 3 hours a day in my car it has to be something that I like to drive. I looked at so many other small car entry's and the all lacked personality, they were all very boring. My first reaction to this was, eew...what is that? But then, it grew on me. I decided it deserved a test drive. I got so many looks on the test drive and the car held its own on the highway passing easily and nimble handling. Auto tranny kept up fine. Love this car!!! SL Pref pack A+. ","Funky interior design-like a wave/teardrop etc. Lots of cupholders. Adjustable backseat, both for leg room and the back reclines for passenger comfort! Built in XM radio and MP3 port. Unique frigde door hatch.

Makes me think the USA is involved in parts. Better yet why didn't Japan test the parts before exporting the Cubes. Are the ones in Japan also getting recalls?","Good paint job, comfortable seats, easy to drive.

I was concerned that the transition of going from a Mercedes that I have driven for the past 10 years to this little car might be a challange.  But with everything so serious these days I decided it was time to have some fun. Be different.  It is a great little car. So comfortable inside. The ride is smooth.  It handles well. I get 32 mpg. It may not be as quite as my Mercedes but it is fine. It is so roomy inside. Even my SO loves it.  We call her the ""Happy"" car. We are having fun","Bluetooth, comfy seats, her curves, MPG.

I test drove nearly every vehicle in this class and am confident I made the right choice.  The car is well built and designed extremely well. Everything has a very solid feel to it and reminds me more of driving my mom's lexus than any of my friend's cars. Drive this one after driving the Kia Soul or the Scion xB and you will never look back.  The cube will offer you smooth pickup (the CVT is awesome!), great handling and suspension, and luxury at a fairly low price.  I know I sound like an ad ... just go drive one!","Love the intelligent key.  If you are a woman you will love it too!  Throw the keys in your purse and you never have to dig them out!!

The cube is EXACTLY what I wanted.  I used the cash for clunkers program so I had to go with the CVT but it works wonderfully, better than any auto could dream of.  It did take some getting used to but the smoothness it returns is worth it.  You don't climb into a cube, you sort of slide into it.  The low flat floor and wide doors make ingress/egress drama free, even for grandparents and our greyhound.  I can't say there's really anything wrong with the car, a few niggles maybe but that's it.  The price tag might hint at ""budget car"" but the car itself screams ""DRIVE ME!""","CVT and the 1.8; smooth, quiet and good mpg's.  The sliding/reclining rear seat is a nice touch and I love never hitting my head on a top opening hatch.  The seats are fantastic, and the overall interior is spacious and very inviting.  I guess my favorite feature is the whole car.","Some kind of center stack with some storage and a passenger arm rest are tops on the list.  Maybe some better tie down points in the cargo area, I don't trust the plastic ones.

The engine in this car idles so smooth and quiet you have to look at the tach to make sure it's still running.  Much less wind noise at highway speeds than I expected from a square car, ride's much smoother than I expected as well.  Has more standard features than you usually find in an entry level car.

4.5,love my CUBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,tom ,07/31/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,4,5,5,5,"Bottom line: this is an econobox so don't expect infiniti luxury. However, what this car does offer is unique headturning design (people will point/look all the time), great mileage (28 so far, but only first tank), decent build quality, great features in certain packages (bluetooth, auto climate, intell key), and unusual roominess inside.  This car does it's job for me... Daily drive, good mileage, can load up on stuff when seats are folded, bt syncing, and above average stereo.  What more can you ask for in this price range.  CVT takes some getting use to. Suspension and steering is a little floaty at times. Bought the sl b/c krom doesnt have intellikey (very weird) conclusion: love my cube","Sl with preferred & ginormous is the best equipped model. You get the body kit, bluetooth, & intellikey (my favorite). Easy in & out. Storage is small, but all the good out weighs  the bad.  Info cluster is Nice. Shows current mileage so you know when you're saving gas.  Again, love my cube!","Major gripe: no storage compartments! This drives me nuts. No coin holders, no center console.. No nothing. The kia soul has this are covered. There's only a glove box and it doesn't even lock. Isn't it written somewhere that a coin drawer is mandatory? cmon Nissan, not to hard to do the little things"

We used the CARS program turning over our 1996 Cadillac in the process. However, now I can't get my wife out of it leaving the 08 Caravan for my daughters. This is a fun car to drive and it turns plenty of heads.  There's an amazing amount of room for the driver and passengers, and visibility is fantastic. The pick up is more than adequate and the gas mileage has been better than expected:  averaging over 32 mpg combined.  Downside: road noise on the highway, but what do you expect for a car in this price range?  Std air, power, ABS, and much more makes this easy to recommend.     ","Styling is unique, headroom is incredible.  Power windows, cruise, decent stereo, ABS, and the swinging back door are great features, as is the reclining back seat.  ","A little more insulation for road noise on the highway at high speeds would be a nice, inexpensive addition.  The passenger side gas filling is a little difficult to get used to after driving Hondas for 25 years. "

One week in and we're getting stopped daily by people who just want to stare at it or sit in it or want to find out more about it. And, we've been happy to answer their questions.  Actually, I think we sold 2 or 3 based on how people respond to the roominess, styling and just coolness of it.  The ride is wonderful.  Soooo smoooth.  The CVT transmission is great.

There was no comparison with the Cube, The Soul had a choppy ride and was less nimble than the Cube. The Soul looked like every other car. The Cube is comfortable..the rear seat is like a couch/recliner. Nissan used the Maxima's foam rubber in all the seats. Controls are easy to use and if you can't see the top 1/4 of the dash (in an earlier review) there is seat height adjustment. I have found minimal road noise at speed. The BEST part of the Cube is the MPG. I have consistently been getting 34-36 mpg combined city/hwy mileage. The engine has a timing chain instead of the rubber ones that need replacing at 60,000 miles. I couldn't be happier!","MPG,MPG,MPG. The interior room and the seats. Also, the lack of a rubber timing chain(less maintenance dollars down the road)and the funky sheetmetal design.",Eliminate/change the saucer-like wheel covers on the base and S models.

We are now looking for the color I want so I can have one too! We bought the Krom in steel grey. It's gorgeous! It turns on a dime and you don't feel like you're in a box. You really cannot fully appreciate it until you sit in it. It's relaxing and smooth riding to me. I haven't noticed any excessive outside wind noise yet. Gets a lot of attention that's for sure. I also feel you get a lot for the price. ","The interior layout.The color choices. You can park it anywhere! The CVT took getting used to, but it's great.I like the safety features. It's just comfortable to be in. People will stop to talk to you about this car everywhere you go. If you don't like attention-this isn't the car for you",Well.I only prefer the SL and Krom because of the larger tires. We are having the two front door windows tinted a little darker like the back doors-it's a little light for us. I wish the Krom came with the intelligent key option.

Unexpected 30.5mpg mileage for her daily 140-mile roundtrip to a new office, 50% better mileage than our Pathfinder. This alone will save us $200 a month. I like a lot of features, esp. with the SL package, and some I don't like, see below.","Intelligent key. No more locked-in keys. (But ""valet key"" can only lock/unlock doors, unless I'm missing something). XM radio/upgraded stereo. Bluetooth (except trouble with a Blackberry, plus only works 1 phn at a time). Comfortable seating. Roomy. Big glove compartment. Turning radius. ","""Valet key"" should be able to start engine. Fix wind noise. Better handling (ride is ""twitchy"").

TL is a nice car), I wanted to get infiniti G37x or Nissan 370 Z. However, my wife liked the look of Cube, and she liked it because of high gas mileage compared to our 06 TL and 07 MDX. I had this car for 4 days. So far, this car gives me a good gas mileage, and I get a lot of attention from people because of its unique appearance. Cube is roomier than it looks and 1.8 SL with SL package gives you many useful features. Interior lighting features and luminating kick plate add an accent to the car as well. Driving is not as powerful as TL, however, it serves its purpose with decency. Very nice car","I-POD integrated audion system Smart Key, Blue Tooth, XM Radio ","Nissan should make Krom model to have smart key option and XM radio option available.

The more I looked at it, the more I liked it! However, it did remind me a lil bit of a circus feel, but I think that it makes it fun. The gas mileage is grreat, the price isn't too bad, compared to other vehicles. I thought it only looked good in White. Throw on some tint, and Nice wheels. And it's gonna look good!

My only disappointment is that the Radio is not XM ready.  I have contacted Nissan about this, and hopefully this can be resolved without using a FM modulated aftermarket unit.

The Cube was perfect for us. It seats ample-sized adults easily, with loads of head and legroom. The reclining/sliding rear seats are a great feature as well.
