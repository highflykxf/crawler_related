4,GMC Playing Games,K.Wilson ,08/17/2016,2,2,5,,,2,2,4,4,,,"I own a GMC Acadia, on a day that I was riding home from work. I hit a pot hold in the streets and my side air bags deployed von both sides. I called the company about the situation. They had me to take it to a dealership to get checked.  After the expert checked it he stated that the airbags deployed correctly with sensors responding to a roll-over. My car had no damage to it at all, I hit a pot hold. They told me it was my fault and I had to get it repaired. I love the vehicle but this kind of service response is not what I or any other consumer needs to here. The sensors malfunctioned so GMC should be responsible in repairing the airbags but because they cost so much they leave me the lonely consumer to pay for it. Which I can not afford or fight them about. If not repair it at least replace the vehicle with another one, this would have not cost the Manufacture a dime.

I am now at 126k miles and GMC will do nothing to help me.  I have talked to multiple people and the one person who gave her extension and said she would help, I cannot reach.  What do I do?  It is going to cost $3,000 to rebuild the transmission and my husbands truck is about to kick the bucket.  My husband has a 2008 GMC avalanche and it has 315k miles on it!!  Amazing truck.  I am currently rethinking whether or not we will be spending any more money with GMC.  Why put a deadline on a faulty item in a vehicle.  If it's bad it's bad!!

Get this, while my vehicle was in the shop for the hundredth time someone from the dealership called and offered me $6k for my car because the manager told him to.  Are you joking?!!

Won't ever buy another SUV without one! Hate having to put my whole body weight into closing the liftgate on my husband's 4-Runner!
 Love the hidden storage compartment in the cargo space.
Have all my car essentials (jumper cables, 1st aid kit, tool box, tire inflator, tow hitch) out of the way & not taking up precious space in main compartment. Large cargo space with 3rd row seats folded, still decent with them up-better than most other SUV's. Interior storage is quite good-roomy console, compartments in doors, good size glove box.
Good cup holders. Back-up assist (3-beep warning) is very useful, even more than rearview camera
","Not the greatest on reliability-been in the shop 7 times in 6 yrs for multiple repairs & recalls at a time. Have had to replace 5 of the 6 ignition coils when 4-5 yrs old!
Obvious design flaw!
At $400 a pop, good thing we bought an extended warranty!
Original tires were annoyingly noisy-much happier when replaced them. Seats could be more comfortable-nice contour but too firm (but that's ""leather"" for you).
Bit of a rough ride-not bumpy so much, but sways side to side.
You feel the slightest nudge of the wheel a lot, especially in the back seat. Auto control AC doesn't work well-only way to have fan on low is to turn AC temp up too warm.

Now that we have owned it a few months the feel of the car has taken a toll.  The interior plastic features are really cheap and the doors are not solid like they were in our Honda when you close them.  I don't know why they used chrome trim in the interior it is a constant distraction when driving.  The back seat floor area is a great crumb catcher for my two girls.  I think the passenger seats gave up comfort when they made them slide and such as they do, nice that they slide but comfort was given up in our opinion when GMC did this.",Exterior ,Better trim material rather than the brittle re-cycled plastic junk No Chrome features in the interior.

Lots of features (some things I haven't even tried yet) and everything is well designed and executed.  I got the Acadia to tow and it has the highest capacity in its class.  The 3rd row seat is very roomy and with that seat folded, the cargo room is very large.  The only disappointment is the fuel economy.  I've always got better mileage than advertised from vehicles I've owned, until this one.  Average MPG is 19 (80/20 highway/city driving).  Other than that, I have no complaints.","folding outside mirrors, bluetooth, power rear door, large, slide console armrest, room and comfort.","better dash trim material, sun roof hardware is un-trimed and visible when the sunshade is retracted."

Loved the stylish exterior.  Looks tough.  Great acceleration and drives excellent on highway. Very smooth & quiet even a high speeds. Does have some blind spots but could be due to my 5ft height.  My 6-ft husband thinks space is tight in the passenger seat, but loves driving it.  LOVE the Bluetooth hands-free calling feature. After I got mine, 2 other teachers @ my school bought the same!  All agree it's their favorite car yet.","Bluetooth, power liftgate, rear bench folding flat, and hidden storage under the rear cargo floor. Also would suggest 2nd row captain's chairs so kids don't fight over space.",More cupholders & storage spaces especially larger storage areas in doors.

The NAV system better than my old Garman, but a little more difficult to program, but once you get used to it, it is fine.","Miss the rain sensor wipers I had on my Trailblazer.

Leaks, trans problems, failed water pump, electrical problems, brake problems, rear hatch lifters, etc.   Whenever I see someone who has put all 10s in their edmunds review, I immediately discount those reviews as someone who is congratulating themselves for a purchase, rather than reviewing a car.   The amount of lemon law lawsuits over the Acadia is stunning.   Too bad actually, because this could have been a great car, but unfortunately, GM has too many problems as a company to take care of their customers.","Great and usable interior, nice taut styling, decent to drive (when the transmission works), good size and layout.

No one wants to actually fix the problem. It may be a LEMON. GMC does not seem to care. So GM cars with all their problems may best be avoided to buy until they resolve to take care of customer problems or replace their LEMONS.

4.375,2009 gmc ,jason ,03/04/2009,,,5,4,4,4,,5,5,4,4,"I bought this in early november to replace my tdi jetta i lost during a recent hurricane. Its very comfy, many bells and whistles, and a hell of a lot more rommier than the toyota highlander I test drove. ","I like the HUD display, and the layout of the dash. i bought this as a family car and the wife can easily move back and forth from the passenger set all the way back to the third row. Thats very handy on long road trips. ",fix the small rubber piece of the sun roof seal. it flaps annoyingly at high speeds when I have the sunroof open. fuel mileage could be a bit better but not bad for a vehilce this big.

5,very pleased,cabo ,03/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We replaced our 2002 Honda Odyssey with a 2009 Acadia in December.  We have put 1,500 miles on it and have had no problems.  24.4 mpg on a recent highway trip.  Pulls our small camper very well.  The only negative is rear visbility when backing up.  ",quiet ride.  bose stereo is great.,All models need a rear view camera.

4.75,So far so good,Va Mom ,02/18/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,I just bought the Acadia but so far I absolutely love this vehicle!  I traded in a Honda CRV because I wanted more room.  I love the way this truck handles and it's so comfortable to sit in / drive. It's amazing how much space there really is on the inside. It's very deceiving from the outside.,"Bluetooth for cell phones, OnStar, remote start and the back up camera are fantastic features!","Better fuel economy, Adjustable head rests for the bucket seats in the rear."

4.75,Perfect,Brian Crawford ,02/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"we liked everything about this vehicle. I rides just a bit harder than thee Enclave, but after owning a dodge Durango for five years we kind of liked a little bit of the truck/suv feel to it. We had to purchase a one year extended warranty to extend the life of the loan out to 72 months instead of 60, and also built into the loan dvd players in the head rest of the two front seat the come with wireless headsets for $1,650. This will keep the kids from fighting more.",Cadillac released a kind of pearl white color with a diamond glisten that makes this vehicle look very stylish as well as sporty. And it can hold i six pack. LOL  ,Get the miles per gallon up to around 28.

2.75,Don't Bother To Buy,Mel-KS ,12/30/2008,,,4,4,1,1,,1,4,3,4,"This vehicle has the transmission problems of previous models.  Ours had 3600 miles when it died in the middle of a busy highway. Towed to a dealership, and the dealership was unable to figure out what was wrong with the vehicle after nearly four days.  GMC absolutely no help and not willing to honor the warranty or have the vehicle brought back to us since it died more than 350 miles from our home.  Best they would do is provide a crappy rental car. I would avoid this vehicle--when GMC goes under, you'll be stuck with a money pit your mechanic will love.",,"GMC needs to go back to producing a quality American vehicle, or simply go out of business and return the taxpayer money to us.  They do not need a bail out, we can't keep bailing out bad companies."

5,GM Quality,william ,12/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We purchased the GMC Acadia for our retirement travels and we have taken 5 trips so far. We have driven in the mountains and in the desert and we are very Impressed with our 2009 purchase from GM. MPG is ,as stated, and better. I think General Motors can feel good about the 2009 Acadia. We sure do!",The ride and performance are what we expected and much more!  ,Rear window could use some sort of airflow to better clean the dust off when dust and dirt are blowing. It is not a major problem.

4.625,Fun to drive,Junior ,12/24/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Love this vehicle. We traded in 06 Buick Terraza and we had nothing but trouble with the Buick so we gave GMC another shot no regrets.This truck is actually roomier than the minivan but drives like a car. I don't have the 4wd, we just got 6 inches of snow here in Chicago and this truck has not yet got stuck anywhere. It's amazing. Not to mention how safe it feels to drive rain or snow the drive is smooth. I highly recomend this vehicle. ",The exterior looks.,"I think that they should all come standard with a backup camera, too many blind spots."

4.5,Great Ride,Pat R ,12/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,2,5,"Great ride, love the navigation, easy to use. Seems to shift strange. Mileage has not been as good as promised. Good looking and fun to drive. Have had many compliments on this vehicle from strangers in parking lots. Cannot believe that the back bumper is not real chrome. For the price of this vehicle it should be real chrome not paper.","Navigation, XM radio, OnStar, leather seats. Like the dash, not lacking in style and is user friendly.",Real chrome. Figure out transmission problems.

3.375,Sleep on it a few weeks first!,kerry ,12/09/2008,,,2,4,2,3,,4,4,4,4,"Looks great on the outside. The interior quality of the dash, seats, & doors, door handles, etc. was a letdown.  Visibility out of rear window not great, you won't see a small car on your bumper. Sensors and backup monitor a must. Having to upgrade better quality leather seats, CD player, & install backup monitor due to visibility issues just two weeks after purchase.",Exterior. Smooth ride.,"Better quality dash & interior, less cheap plastic. Better exterior mirrors less prone to scratches when other cars scrape by them.  Interior handles need to be above the window, not forward where they are useless. All models need to have multiple cd player capability.  "

4.625,It's OK to Buy American,TJ in Philly ,10/24/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,4,"This is my first car made by an American company. In the past I owned Honda, Toyota, and most recently a 2005 Acura MDX. Before I purchased the Acadia I test drove a 2008 MDX (did not like the looks of inside/outside) Highlander (nice, but still not there), 2009 Honda Pilot (did not really care for the interior). I finally decided to take a look at GM's offering. Decided to test drive the Acadia first. Once I was in it, there was no looking back. The interior design and comfort of this SUV is amazing. Seats and ride are comfortable. The technology is also top notch, and I am a techie. Please, just because this car is a GMC do not make the mistake of not adding this car to your list. ","Nav system, Bluetooth, OnStar, 2nd row captain's seats, roominess, remote start, and color (Dark Metallic Blue). Gas mileage has also been good, averaging city at 18.6 mpg, highway at 24.3 mpg for a FWD. Not bad for a car this big. ","On the highway the vehicle is not as quite as the MDX, wind and road noise is noticeable, ride not as refined as the MDX, but hey, with the deal I got, I can except the very minor drawbacks. "

4.75,Great model for GM,Tom ,10/09/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a great SUV. It has power, comfort, great handling, and also looks amazing. All features/controls are easy to use.  It handles like a sports car and is extremely comfortable to ride in. Would highly recommend.","3rd row seating, easy to reconfigure seating/storage room, great handling, remote start, audio/climate controls",Fuel economy not what window sticker says. Might add more design to inside dashboard (Looks like a big piece of plastic)

4,Nice Car,Tom Foley ,09/07/2008,,,4,5,2,5,,5,5,2,4,"A few weeks into the purchase and I find it a pleasure to drive.  Though, I can't be sure if it still suffers a little tranny shifting issues like the 08 did. I'm not really a car person, but doesn't seem as smooth in some instances.  I wish I paid a little more careful attention to the plastic dashboard and other pieces.  While at first glance the interior looks great, a closer look reveals all the plastic which will probably get scratched in the long haul.  It's textured, so good luck getting scratches out. So far, it's just a fine car.",Cargo space is nice. Bluetooth integration works awesome!  Rearview camera in mirror impresses many.  ,"Less plastic in interior. Makes me wonder why I spent all this money.  With the SLE at least, a spare tire isn't included as standard. Gimme a break!  (Though I have it as an add- on.)  A few other simple things could be included at this level such as fold in mirrors... instead:  extra."
