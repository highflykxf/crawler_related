5,"190,000 Miles of Punishment Endured!",Thomas P. ,10/16/2016,5,3,5,,,5,4,3,4,,,"For the basic car driver: I was not joking in the title. I push this car harder than it was ever designed to be pushed. The gas pedal is more of an On/Off switch against the floor than something you step on lightly to get up to speed. To account for this, I do early oil changes and transmission services. The car has absolutely no fluid leakage whatsoever and the motor has never once missed on regular gas. Do NOT use premium fuel unless you install an aftermarket turbo and need the additional octane to eliminate detonation. The car hates High Octane fuel, especially on cold starts. For the Home Mechanic: This car is designed for simplicity of operation and service. To swap out the rear suspension, you literally pull 2 large bolts and the whole rear end is able to swing down to replace any component. Little things like this make me love it more. I have also installed 14,000 Lumens of off-road light bars and a 75 watt shortwave HAM radio in it. It took both and the alternator keeps up like a champ. I have modded, manipulated, and punished this car on 1000's of miles of logging roads and mountain passes and it keeps running. Best investment ever!",,

I now have 200K miles and use this as my second car for short trips. So far everything still works and no major mechanical issues or rusts. As long as you are changing the oil every 4K miles and tune up every 75K miles you should be good. Just be easy on the gas pedal since it doesn't have a lot of power.,,

When you say Corolla, you don't think about the XRS model, but this model is great. The 2.4-liter engine has great pickup with the manual transmission, and climbing grades is a lot better than with the 1.8 liter, with extra power on tap for passing. The interior is cheap, like others say, but it's a Toyota and 7 years old at that, so I am not expecting much. For a guy in his twenties that wanted something awesome but still practical and reliable, I have to say I am in love with my XRS Corolla.

The Corolla has surprised me with its comfort, 27 mpg mixed hiway/street, and how well it has retained its good looks. The car is clean and functional with everything I need to comfortably get from A to Z. My only disappointment is that the car doesn't have Bluetooth or USB ports. It does have an auxiliary port that connects to the radio, so I am able to listen to books, music, news - whatever.

Pros: Extremely reliable; We bought it new in June, 2008 and now (Oct., 2015) are still driving it with over 132,000 miles. The only real repair, other than the wearables, (tires, brakes, etc.) has been a rear wheel hub replacement ($500. expense) which was necessary due to a bad internal sensor.  We found out later that a properly-inserted pipe cleaner might have cleaned off the dirty, not defective, sensor and eliminated even that repair expense.  We really like our Corolla and consider it to be our most dependable, and economical vehicle evr.  PS: We have been driving for 41 years and have had well over 20 vehicles in that time period.",,

4.75,First Toyota,First Corolla ,03/25/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I was either going to buy a Yaris or the Corolla and when I drove up to the lot there was a Barcelona red Corolla and a red Yaris. The salesman thought I should get the Corolla because of the more roominess and other options. Best friend has a Yaris and he gloats how it gets better mileage but I don't think I have made a mistake in getting the Corolla. I put about fifty miles a day in it so I was looking for fuel economy and I love the style of this car. The color turns many heads and it drives great! I get about 31 miles a gallon in the winter and it goes up to 35 in the summer. Eighty percent of my driving is freeway.  Its a great car.,Easy to park and turn around.

My other car has a clutch, no problem there and anyone who drove this corolla had issues also. Paid 19k. It was only worth 9k a little over a year later. Cramped, zero headroom, cheap paint job, plastic parts that snap in the cold. It did have good gas mileage tho, and I could have dealt with all of the cosmetic stuff, but the stalling out in traffic thing is just plain dangerous. Didn't want to wait for a recall and maybe become a statistic. Shame on you Toyota!","Great gas, mileage, great headlights for night driving","Use better quality materials.

2.875,OK except wierd brake placement,Robert Weiner ,02/19/2010,,,4,2,2,4,,3,3,3,2, traded in an old SUV and got clunker discount on a new Corolla. Main problem with the Corolla is brake pedal engages way down near the floor where the accelerator pedal is.  Easy to hit accelerator when trying to brake.  Why does Toyota for 2009 decide to situate non-adjustable break point so low?     Electronic steering becomes annoying after a while too.  No real road feel as in a normal hydraulic steering system.  ,rear seats fold down for long cargo. Engine very peppy (so don't hit  accelerator unless you really want power!)  ,Reposition brake pedal away from accelerator territory. Go back to hydraulic assisted rack and pinion steering.

The car used to steer like the front was toed in.  The problem issues were that the car was out of alignment in the rear and the Goodyear Eagle tires. The rear axle of an LE is a ""stamped axle"" and has no alignment adjustment. I had to have an alignment shop modify the rear axle bolt position to bring the car into a correct factory assignment. Once that was done the car steers as you would expect and it gained about 2 miles per gallon in fuel economy. I also replaced the Goodyear Eagle tires which are not safe on wet pavement with Yokohama Avid Tour S tires.  Now a very nice car!","The fuel economy is remarkable. I get between 33-39 mpg at 70 miles per hour. The inside cabin noise is very low, much quieter than a Civic. The purchase price is very reasonable. The car has great resale value and looks nice.

My wife wasn't too happy but reluctantly allowed me to go for it! ,"Comfortable, stylish, eye appeal",Have minor hearing problem. Warning chimes go undetected. Left lights on twice already but will make adjustment. Clock should be in radio and always visible. Tilt wheel adjustment awkward.

4.875,Great Car,Saladin ,04/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"I was debating between this corolla, a new Si or a used Nissan Sentra, and I went with the Corolla. I am very happy with my choice. I hated the style of the Civic Si. The car runs very smooth with no problems, and despite what many say, I have had no problems with the steering. The MPG is great. It's a fun little car to drive, great turn angle and super-easy to control. If you are into racing, you wont be beating v6 cars of course, but when you're up against another v4 consumer car, you will most likely come out as the winner thanks to the great engineering of this car.","Exterior and interior appearance, MPG.",A little more engine power as well as having the clock placed in a more convenient location.

When driving behind a truck, same thing.  Can't believe Toyota could let this thing on the road.  Seats are very uncomfortable.

The only complaint I have with the Corolla, is the highway noise above 60 mph. Anybody else, have this complaint? Also, my left front tire is wearing, on the outside edge.

Some people dont have problems with it, but some cars are coming off the line with this problem. Have to have 2 hands on the wheel. If you take one hand off the wheel to adjust the radio (particularly if in winds greater than 15 mph) you may find yourself going out of your lane.

Whatever small gains you get from the electric steering assist are nullified by any small gust of wind. You can't relax in a car when you're blowing all over the highway in the slightest wind.  Furthermore, the seats are doughy and unsupportive. If you've ever had lower back problems in any car, this one will bring them right back. My Volkswagen had firm, supportive seats and I forgot what it was like to have a sore back after a trip - until now.  Cheap backseats too - pull on a corner when they're ""locked"" and it will have enough give for you (or a criminal) to reach into the trunk.  Awful creamsicle backlighting treatment on the dash too.

3.125,Should've gotten the Yaris instead,Ex-Toyotafan ,11/15/2008,,,1,1,5,5,,2,5,5,1,"I went to the dealership to get a Prius and ended up with a Corolla.  Bad decision.  If I was looking at fuel efficiency and fun to drive and style in a Toyota, I should've listened to my gut feeling and picked up the Yaris hatchback instead.  It's far more pleasing to the eye.  The Corolla only excels in build quality and fuel efficiency. These are major things for most people and most people seem to definitely go past the looks and driving dynamics of this awkward-looking refrigerator.   The interior is not bad except it looks more like the Korean cars of yesteryear, the floaty ride is good if I am the passenger and 4-speed auto is to dated, so as the drum rear brakes.

So far we are very happy with the performance of this car. Mileage is excellent, runs smooth, not so great on the luxury but the money we spent on BMW repairs, I rather go for an okay looking car that is cheaper to maintain and lasts much longer.

My XRS usually surprises people driving an Integra who think they can overtake me from stop (except they brutally cut into line, then I give up).  It got tremendous torque for such a small car. However, it does come with a price - the gas mileage isn't great at all.  Besides, the suspension is a bit too stiff.

The car has adequate ""get up and go"" and has almost no wind noise on the freeway.  The seats are very comfortable, they are set higher up and give you a great view of the road while driving.  The only distraction is the placement of the armrests - too low on the door. The car has a great stereo and the placement of the interior features are perfect and very easy to use.

The only design flaw is the lack of proper location of arm rests for the drivers seat. This really comes in play on the highway; not as much in the city.  Suggestion: If you log the high miles, purchase the bumper-to-bumper package. For the additional $700.00 it will pay itself off in the off-chance this Toyota has a major mechanical failure.

Why?  Toyota's reputation for reliability is seldom matched, and competing brands weren't outstanding. It's a solid feeling car that performs as well or better than almost any other economy vehicle. The mileage is superb: with about a half-and-half mix of heavy town traffic and mountain driving, it has averaged 35.8 MPG! Much better than advertised.

The ""Hot Car"" magazines may pan it, but average drivers will be happy.","  This car was a demo, and has everything: sunroof, cruise control, VSC and all the other goodies.

There is a button you have to push 7 times to get back around to the clock, located behind the wheel to the left.  Look before you buy a Sport model.  Do not assume that normal options come in every model.  I love Corollas but I hate the Sport model.  It's still fun to drive but I can't get comfortable.  I prefer driving my mothers 2006 Corolla.

The ride is smooth and quiet, and I am averaging about 31 mpg on mostly highway miles. The transmission shifts great, and the JBL/XM radio/stereo is a blast.  Oddly enough though, it ejects a CD and then shuts off once in a while for no reason.  The dealer said that this could be caused by using colored or labeled CDs (makes sense), but this happens even when using the FM or XM radio too - weird.  Also, the roof is leaking and during rain water is coming though the inside of the A pillars into the interior. But overall this is the best car I have ever owned and assuming they can fix the roof leak I will definitely buy a Toyota again.","JBL stereo & XM radio, Sport package & sporty looks, very quiet ride, good handling on wet or dry roads, and good gas mileage.","Correct the leaky roof problem, and increase the reliability of the JBL stereo system a bit.

We have two kids and realized that we don't need the that big of a vehicle and wanted to save gas instead.  Who cares about 0-60 performance?  Who buys a family sedan to drag race it?  For us, the 1.8 liter performs perfectly fine around town and on long trips.  The gas mileage is fantastic and, compared to our minivan, was worth the price of admission.  So if you want a good, comfortable, reliable, safe, and economical car to haul your family around this car is the one for you.  If you want a sports car then buy a sports car.","Fuel economy, MPG and trip computer, and the flat floor for the back seat.  The telescoping steering wheel is a nice touch.

Its got the redesigned front and fancier lights.  The display on the dash for clock, mpg, range, should have more than one display.  You can't see what time it is unless you have it on clock.

I love how wide the car is, my wife and I have a 2004 S Corolla and this is a different car all together.  I love the steering and the ride but the brakes should've been 4-disc versus drum.

I loved the redesigned look of the latest Camry when it out, and this new 2009 corolla is like a smaller version of the Camry.

Myself, my wife and our 3 girls (one who is still in a safety-seat). The JBL stereo upgrade is well worth it, it sounds great with plenty of deep bass, and the added Bluetooth support that comes with it is a God sent.

I am a male in my late 20s and for how agressive and clean the car looks, the name evokes a complete opposite response from people. Everyone thinks it is a weak chick mobile. I wish Toyota would keep the platform, change the name and market the car more like the Civic. Anyway, the bottom line is I wanted a car that got great gas mileage, carried 5 passengers, has decent speed, is reliable, and looked good. It was the smart choice due to unforeseeable gas prices, but unless your friends, family, or peers know what the new XRS looks like, they will think you drive that old school rollerskate.",Airbags galore. I also like the extra horse power over the stock. It is more noticeable at speeds between 0-30 mph and 70-100 mph. I don't know exactly why? Maybe the 30-70 mph is the mpg sweet spot and they toned it down in that range. I test drove the S in automatic for comparison.,"It needs a beefier looking rear end and I wish that they improved the sound system performance. They should have added a subwoofer. Also, the XRS needs TRD exhaust or something that will make it louder. The car is so quiet. People with manual transmission like a nice sounding growl."

The car feels very tight with no rattles or squeaks and it rides pretty good on the highway. The car is very quiet with little wind and road noise and the engine is quiet which gives this car a high quality feel. The brakes feel good and the trunk seems roomy. The paint is very nice and looks quality. The steering feels too touchy and it takes constant correction to hold a straight line at highway speeds. If I would have known about this steering flaw I might not have bought this model. Take a long test drive and decide for yourself before you buy.,"Great fuel mileage. Nice quiet ride. I really like the body style and the compact radio antenna, looks quality The dual glove compartments is nice and so is the keyless entry. I like the mileage computer but it's not accurate. The radio and CD player sound pretty good to me. The radio works well. ",The steering needs to be reworked. The front seats could use some more thigh support and get rid of the fabric in the arm supports in the doors that will get dirty easily.

It's quiet and has a very smooth ride. The moonroof is cool, as is the satellite radio and 6-CD changer. It's very comfortable to drive and feels solid. The interior dome light comes on when the key is turned off. The running lights get brighter as the environment darkens. The power windows remain operable for a minute or so after the key is turned off for those of us who habitually forget to close the windows before turning off the car. The trunk is roomy and even has a place to set things so they won't fall over, like a gallon of milk. It's Toyota quality and innovation. ","All the storage places, even a sunglass compartment, 2 gloveboxes, storage in console, big pockets on back of front seats for atlas, map pockets in doors. Good acceleration and maneuverability. Excellent stereo system with 8 speakers. All the information available on the dashboard (MPG, temp, range).",I need to see the clock and the outside temp simultaneously! When I sit in the driver's seat I cannot see the front of the car. The driver's seat is comfortable but not as supportive as my old 92 Corolla.

The car is a decent ride. Im a little biased because I previously owned a Camry so Im not yet used to the Corolla getting whipped around in gusts of wind. The touch screen navigation is a great option for the compact car. I was concerned with the quality of the sound since the JBL speakers and navigation are not a combined option with the XLE. The speakers surpassed my expectation by far. There are no buttons to change the radio; everything is touch screen which can pose as a problem while driving. Gas mileage is never as advertised but nevertheless very efficient. ,"Sleekness of the new design, navigation as an option, aux for the iPod, heated mirrors, alloy wheels, maintenance indicators.

I've got to say that the new Corolla by far is the best mid size car out there for the money, I have been driving it know for a month and totally love it! Great on gas and great to drive handles awesome. I also own an 05 Corolla and got to say that Toyota did a great job on the new design, a must to test drive.","The body, new sporty head light design and body kit that looks aftermarket. Hands free bluetooth totally cool and easy to set up.","Maybe display the clock where other passengers can see the time, also the back door seems to be a tight squeeze to put in or pull out a car seat."

5,"My Black Sand Pearl, 2009 Corolla S",Lakesguy ,03/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great JBL-6 disk w/XM stereo.  Ride is controlled and solid, brakes are strong.  Acceleration is pretty much the same as my old 2006 S.  Car is VERY quiet on the road.  Great gas mileage and great looks.","Average mpg, distance to empty, outdoor temp, multifunction display area... nice to know these things.","I wish the clock was separate from the multifunction display (average mpg, distance to empty, etc).  You need to push a little button to toggle between the clock and all other functions... not that easy to do while driving since the button is small and I need to reach through the steering wheel."

5,Nice for getting around town,Deborah Stone ,03/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just bought the new 2009 corolla and am impressed with the leg room for my teen kids.  It is simple, elegant and very much affordable for a single woman who has teenagers.  ","I love where I can place my ipod in the car, the wood grain look, the double glove compartment, the overall comfort.",

5,2009 Corolla XLE,jilliew ,03/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this new body style on the Corollas. I decided to get this over the Prius at the last minute and saved a ton of money and I'm not one bit sorry. The ride in this car is very smooth and handles the road well. I feel safe with all the great safety features it comes with, and the 10 airbags protect everyone that's in the car. Gas mileage is wonderful. I'm averaging 38 mpg. The car has a long list of standard features and they are all good. All told, it's a GREAT value for the money. I'm a first time Toyota owner and I'm very very pleased with this car. It's a keeper for sure.","Bluetooth, JBL stereo system with the 6 CD changer, XM radio, plug for an iPod or other electronics, and phone and audio controls on the steering wheel are just awesome. Dual glove compartment nice also. ","Would have been nice to have the smart key system, fog lights, and rear spoiler standard, though you can have fog lights and spoiler installed later."

4.875,Great car,jose ,02/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"This is a car for those who prefer quiet and comfort to a sport like driving experience.  It provides all the right stuff.  I have driven the competition, particularly the Mazda3, and yes it is a more spirited driving machine.  However, where in any week or any place will you need such a driving experience? I would buy another in a minute.  ","Comfort, quiet, roomy, ability to get into the car without contorting one's body or hitting one's head, and of course, economy and careful build. ",Provide a/c with auto temp control - more interior color options

4.75,2009 Corolla S,applecandy ,02/20/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Great car for the money, not a sports car but gets some of the best gas mileage in the industry while looking like you are going 200 MPH.  28-35 MPG with the new real 2008 EPA rating system and seats 4 adults. I have owned many BMW 318s and I would take this car any day over them. I wanted a reliable, safe, good on gas car to drive to work, that also looks sporty.  I found that and much more.  The car comes standard in any trim level with full font and side air bags front/rear and is 5 star rated front and side impact.  It even has motors in the seats for active headrest in case you get rear ended. Includes tire pressure sensors.  Great, safe, great on gas and looks like a race car!","Barcelona red metallic paint and S package with 17"" alloys.  The looks!!!! And gas mileage with dual VVT-i.",Medium gray interior option on S model would be nice.
