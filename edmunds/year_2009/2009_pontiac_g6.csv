4.25,2009.5 Pontiac G6 GT Sedan,evnsptc ,11/04/2013,,,3,5,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"I ordered a new G6 from my local dealer in October of 2009. I got it about a month later and it came with (black/tan heated leather, power moonroof, spoiler, 17' polished 5 spoke rims, 3.5L V6, AM/FM/XM/CD/AUX radio, Monsoon speaker system, power seat) When I got it I was very surprised. The exterior is beautiful! The interior is very nice too. I took it home and was in shock to find out how well this car handled! The suspension is taught yet soft at the same time! The steering feels like a German sports sedan! It currently has 23K miles on it and has given me no problems at all! I get it professionally detailed every 3 months I detail it myself in between. I love it so much!","Moonroof, 17' Rims, Monsoon audio, XM Radio, OnStar, Heated Seats, Spoiler, Exterior, Engine (which is powerful at 221HP, it doesn't sound the greatest at full throttle but it is very willing) and the Handling! I get 27 mpg combined!!

I loved my G6 so much that I traded in my Grand Prix towards a 10' GT Coupe! Which is also a great car, it has even better handling than the sedan!

The engines should have been:

Base: 2.5L I4 (VVT & iVLC) (eAssist/Start/Stop/Regen. Brakes optional) 210HP
GT: 3.0L V6 (VVT, SIDI & AFM) 270HP
GTP: 2.8L Turbo V6 (VVT, SIDI & AFM) 355HP
GXP: 3.6L Twin Turbo V6 (VVT, SIDI & AFM) 440HP

GTP and GXP trims have HiPer struts to reduce torque steer. . .","The transmission is only a 4-Speed and should be a 6-Speed. I wish there was a navigation option. The Monsoon stereo is good, but a Bose would have been much appreciated. I wish Pontiac offered a panoramic moonroof at the time. I wish there was a Heads Up Display. The interior could have had more of a refresh for the 2009.5 edition (the door panels should have been trimmed/padded with leather, the dash could have been made with a little bit better materials). I wish the rear seats had an armrest, audio controls and hvac."

2.875,Pontiac should be ashamed!!!!,larondag ,04/03/2013,,,3,4,1,3,,2,3,4,3,i received a recall letter for the transmition in Dec 2012.I took my car to the dealership to have the recalled part repaired in March of 2012.Two days after the repair I start experiencing problems with my steering and my power steering went out a week later.After searching the internet i found out that this is a huge problem for this model.I then called Pontiac and they opened a case for this issue.i was advised to take my car to my local dealer and if they advise that it was not due to wear and tear or lack of matianence then they would assist with reimbursement.I took my car to the dealer and was advised that the torque sensor was bad.,"The sensor is only sold with the entire column therefore it cost me an additional 2 hours of labor.
The dealer advised Pontiac that i should receive assistance and the part shouldnt have gone bad and that it was electrical.. I spoke with Distric Manager at Pontiac and was advised that since i purchased the car with 38k miles it was outside of warranty and since the car has 100k miles they would not assist me with the repair.
Ive also notice electrical problems with the headlights and the entire front bumper has to be dropped to change the sockets.
Thats gonna cost $200 in labor alone.
Pontiac sent a memo to all dealers advising of the PS problem and they should replace the steering colum","The fact that they
know of this problem and refuse to replace it is an issue for me.
Does someone have to be killed before they recall this part?
i was also advised by my mechanic that the catylitic converter is known to go bad and he has replace 10 just in 2013.
This car is just down right out faulty.
Cant trade it in because i owe too much.. I dont plan to take this laying down.
i am going to fight them all the way on this problem."

3.5,"A decent ""cheap"" car",partsman99 ,06/21/2012,,,2,4,3,4,,5,3,3,4,"This is a decent car. Not a fan of all the plastic everywhere, and the very thin hollow sound of the doors when you close them, but other than that not a bad car. Key fobs = terrible! They're expensive, and do not last long. The 3.5L has more than enough power, and never ceases to amaze me. Car is VERY quiet; you can barely hear the engine rev. Excellent fuel economy: hwy averages around 28, with as much as 36 on a long road trip. The controls are easy to read, and arranged well. The seats start to get uncomfortable after 5 hours in on a road trip. In short, if you are looking for basic transportation that is dependible and capable of passing slower cars, this is a good choice. ","Remote start, speed controlled volume on radio, plenty of horsepower, decent sound system, excellent headlamps.","Key Fobs are absolutely terrible, bordering on unacceptable. I am still using the original fob for my 2003 Grand Prix with no problems, and this G6 has been through 4 of them. At $127 + programming per fob, it turns into one expensive ""feature"" of the car. Steering isn't the greatest, and is greatly affected by what kind of tires are on the car (which is a first for me. Of all the cars I've owned, I've never experienced this.) Cheap Cheap CHEAP interior plastic everywhere, which I acknowledge that this isn't a luxury car, but it's just chinsey. Sunvisor will not stay up. I/S rearview mirror moves while driving. "

4.625,Great car for the money,pjz3 ,04/08/2012,,,4,5,5,4,,4,5,5,5," I recently purchased a used 2009 pontiac G6 with 33,000 miles. I really wasn't looking for a G6 but when I saw this one and test drove it I couldn't pass it up. All the other cars I test drove in this price range,(between 10,000 and 15,000),didn't even compare. The ther cars lacked in accesories or were much smaller and under powered. The G6 with everything I was looking for in a car plus nice styling and handling. The horse power from the 2.4L ecotec engine won't win any drags but it's no slouch oh the hiway. My family and i took the G6 on a short 200 mile trip just to see how it would do. We only used a Quarter tank of gas the whole trip. Over all a great little car.","Hard to choose one I like the sat. radio a lot and the on star makes navagation a breeze, also gives me peace of mind knowing if something happens, like an accident or the car breaks down all we have to do is push the on star button and help is on the way.",Bring back Pontiac! Corporations think too much about the bottom line and not enough about how it effects there customers. When ford planned to turn the Mustang into a front wheel drive car with only a V6 and not a V8 they were over run with letters from people who didn't want that to happen. In the end ford listened to the people and think what it would have done to that great car! The mustang is one of the best muscle cars out there today. So GM listen to the people who remember what Pontiac was and what a new Pontiac could become.

I changed the tire size to 235/55-17 and it looks great with the wider tires, my wife wants me to paint it red she hates the white.Is there anything I can do to give it more HP??I would like to find a rear wing for it (used)if anyone has one email me.

It rides so amazingly, it has every feature I would want and more. The inside is so roomy and it is very sleek looking. It looks great on the outside too. It only gets about 21 mpg but to be honest I could car less because I just love it so much. Seriously best car I have ever owned, too bad Pontiac was discontinued.",I love how roomy it is and how you can pull up on the screen how many miles you have left in your tank and stuff like that. The sound system is really great too!,The only thing I don't like is where the cup holders are because I like to rest my arm on the center console and if you have a drink there you will be resting your hand on it because it is right in front of the center console.

Since the test drive I have fallen head over heels for this car. The performance is great, it handles very well and smoothly in all situations.  Also it has been very reliable and dependable for me. I was also happily surprised to discover its fuel economy is nothing to frown at either.  Overall this car has many perks and great aspects to it.",The menu features with the car's information such as oil life and tire pressure just a button push away is a major plus not to mention the feature in the sound system that rises and falls with the speed of the vehicle is nice so I'm not constantly changing the volume when I accelerate or slow down.,One improvement I could suggest is the interior design could be better if some of the surfaces held a better look than silver plastic that clashes against the smaller nicer looking chrome that highlights the buttons and nobs littered around the car.

If for a minute I didn't loke the 07 model, I never would have purchased the 09. It is a good looking car and fun tho drive. It has enough power with the 3.5 V6 and handles good. I am so mad that GM stopped making Pontiac. I have owned Pontiac for the last 20+ years, and will miss them. I am still a GM guy, I just have to decide where to go next in the GM family. I remember on a 500 mile trip, I got 30.2 MPG and did not go under 55 MPH, spending much of the time at 70MPH and more. I was impressed with that. OnStar and navigation are useful also.

Why did I buy it, Classic exterior look, great engine,good deal for the money,and the fact that GM is GM, and I wanted to stay American with some style.","classic exterior, great engine",Why bother since they are a decontinued make

2.375,Drives like a rental,josh ,06/20/2009,,,1,4,2,2,,4,2,2,2,"I am currently renting this car. Overall its a very dissapointing car. I normally drive an 2007 Audi a4 and given my A4 only cost me about 5k more then a new G6 GT it feels about 100% better in terms of interior quality, handling and overall build quality. The only thing I am impressed with is the 3.5 V6 which feels a lot stronger then the 219 HP its putting out. ",Engine pulls very strong from 2000- 5000 RPM. ,Too many to list. This car and other American cars like it explain the Demise of the American car. It does just about everything poorly. Japanese and German cars of similar price are far superior. Pontiac's old slogan was We Build Excitement but I think it should be We Build Cheap Thrills.

5,Best MPG vs Dollar Spent,dhg6 ,06/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Looked at at lot of cars. Found 2009 G6 Sedan with 4 cyl and 6 speed auto trans. I commute 120 miles round trip per day. 1st tank of gas avg 35 mpg for a range of 525 miles. With the blow out prices and warranty and 2 yrs of Onstar,free maint, and free xm radio for 2 yrs. Best bang for the buck  ",Fuel economy with a decent midsized package.,Not really crazy about the red dash lights

Compared to an import it was much less expensive. We think the AMERICAN CARS GET A BAD RAP FROM REVIEWERS.","Looks, handling,comfort,price,and a joy to drive.",NONE. Unless you want to pay a lot more for the car.

4.125,"So far, I love this car....",cam ,04/09/2009,,,3,4,4,4,,5,4,4,5,Purchased my G6 Coupe brand new.  Love it.  It has a heavy ride (which I prefer!) The gas mileage is good considering I don't break 35 mph on my 4 mile drive to work.   The interior leaves a lot to be desired....way too much plastic. And I wish the seats sat up straighter.  They need one more notch to sit up all the way.  One other thing....There are too many cup holders in the car too.  I'd rather have an armrest in the back.  LOVE the exterior....especially the back!,"Exterior, the ride","Interior, a spoiler that wasn't so cartoonish"

4.625,Fun to Drive,bobandsherry ,03/28/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Wife wanted a convertible, moving from Infiniti G35 coupe. She wanted hard top so that really limited selection. No, the G6 isn't a G35, but it also costs about 30-35% less. That said, the G6 is still plenty car to get person from point A to point B with plenty of pick-up and go.  In Midwest, being able to drive in snow is even more a necessity than dropping the top in summer, G6 handles GREAT in snow with stock tires. G6 is sporty, functional and fun to drive - can't wait for summer. No problems.","Fun to drive, sporty, great performance, decent back seat space (especially for a convertible).","Gas mileage, lack of locking storage space in cabin, cheap looking sun visor (really, GM could drop $10-20 more for cloth, no?)"

3.25,Disappointing,Jackson Johns ,10/10/2008,,,1,5,4,5,,3,2,3,3,"I have an Accord.  I got this car as a rental while my Accord was in the shop for a few weeks.  Wow.  Did Pontiac ever try out other cars?  The seats were uncomfortable. There was no place to put my sunglasses.  Only 2 cup holders. None in the back seats.  It has a horrible turning radius.  The engine was very nice.  Overall, you can do much better than this.",The engine was responsive and powerful.,"Cup holders, places in the door to hold things.  A sunglass holder.  Seats that are more comfortable.  A thermostat on the air conditioner to set temperature.  Pontiac: Go drive other cars in this class.  This car is missing a LOT of features."
