5,200+K miles without a wrench put on it!,Mario ,11/30/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,3,4,,,"This car was our 5th Subaru, and it is being replaced by a newer model. All of our Subarus went well over 200,000 miles without ever having to take them into the dealer for a repair. The only time any of our Subarus were in the shop was for normal engine maintenance that required tools or expertise beyond the average owner's ability or tool ownership (even spark plug changes need a 'special' tool to accomplish); eg. timing belt, cam belt & cam seals, water pump at about 85,000 or more miles. I did all oil & oil filter changes at 5000 mile intervals and air filter changes, myself. You also can save a little money by buying spark plugs at an auto parts store and just pay the labor to have a dealer install them. These cars are so trouble-free, you get in it, turn the key and the engine always starts. On my first Subaru wagon a 1985, at about 125,000 miles a slight hesitation on acceleration off idle developed. I took it in to the local Subaru specialist shop to diagnose & fix it. When I picked up the car, the mechanic told me (jokingly) I should be ashamed of my self for the cause of the problem. The ORIGINAL spark plugs were still in the engine - I never changed them!  He couldn't believe I hadn't yet changed the plugs. So, we're buying another Outback.",,

Blown head gaskets are the norm and repairs are $2500-3000 or a new engine for $4500.  even at 110K the engine is gone.  maintained regular and treated the car good but the seals in the engine went out earlier causing bad oil leaks then a cam issue and finished off the fun with a blown head gasket.

I have never fallen out of love with this car -- the looks, the handling, the 6 cyl engine, the comfort and seating position, the harmon-kardon sound system, the overall performance, reliability, and integrity.  Semi-luxurious car-like transport that can also be your truck when you need to haul lots of stuff in back.  Well, regarding reliability, although I only have 36,000 miles on it, the front CV boots failed and the CV joints were worn and needed replacing recently.  Seems too early to have a problem like that, but I guess driving the gnarly and pot-holed big city streets can do that to a front end.  Glad I never do any real off roading!

4,Wish they still made this more car-like wagon,Subie Driver ,01/26/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,4,4,,,"Bought the car used with around 60K; it's now at 114K. Drove the newer generation, but found it rode too truck-like, and was kind of noisy, with an unrefined drivetrain. It was also hard to see out of and had particularly uncomfortable front seats. This generation is more car-like and the better for it (haven't driven the latest gen, though). It's an incredibly versatile vehicle - it drives like a sedan (and is fairly luxurious with the heated leather seats and wood trim), but has more cargo room than a similarly sized/equipped SUV. The downside is the drivetrain, which, though not as noticeably as the same-level one in the next generation, still lacks refinement, being a bit noisy and having some vibration. At certain speeds the transmission pauses before engaging, clunking when it finally does. Also the dual climate control doesn't work well, leaving both front seat occupants unhappy. But overall the car is comfortable and efficient both in town or on the highway and is like a Swiss pocket knife in terms of usability, perfect for hauling everything from furniture to dogs to groceries, while still being easy to park and decent on gas, and it has been completely reliable. Build quality is excellent, too, with interior and exterior materials holding up fantastically, even though the car's not garaged. If you're far from a major city, you may have a hard time finding people who understand this relatively rare car and how to work on and properly outfit it with brakes, tires, etc.,  and service things like the differentials, so keep that in mind.",,

This car is the closest thing to a lemon I could think of.  After 6 months of ownership the interior of the vehicle was breaking apart. Small holes in the stitching in the doors and the center counsel lid broke.  Subaru repaired the lid and it soon broke again. Very cheep. The handling and engine performance became horrible after a couple of years.   As of today, the power steering unit is shot - not sure what this will cost yet to replace. I recently had the transmission leak and the thermostat sensor replaced at the dealership ($600.00 plus).  Then a month later the valve cover gasket broke causing oil to run into and foul out the plugs.  This repair cost over $850.00 once they figured out what was wrong with it.  I'll sum it up here, this is a terrible car. Don't buy one, it's no Toyota. It gets horrible gas mileage and over time has no engine power. It just screws you over with repairs.",,

I went to Carmax looking for a smaller hatchback, but this one had arrived on the lot the day before, and the price was right (the option of extended warranty through 150k miles was a nice touch).I'm loving most everything about this car, and what I don't love, I do like. ","Interior layout is excellent. Everything is in a place that makes sense and is easy to get to. Telescoping tilt steering wheel, leather wrapped, leather seats with lumbar support for driver and passenger (plus heated and electric control for both) is great. Dual zone climate control helps keep peace with your significant other. The 3 drive mode options (I, S, S#) are great. I'm on I 90% of the time, but S# is a lot of fun. Plenty of cargo room (saw a complaint about not enough? Weird) Great stereo (no rattles here?) and the auto dimming rearview is just plain cool. Full time AWD feels sturdy and handles tight. The 2.5L Turbo... I'll get to in a second :) Remote Start and keyless entry.","For being the XT Limited model, I expected a little more from the performance side. It has some zip for sure, but the turbo has a little more lag than I had hoped (I know that's the nature or a turbo, but some do it better than others) and I echo the sentiments of the 3, 4, and 5 gear ratios. There is a lot of jump from 5 to 3 which seems like could have been avoided.

The handling more than makes up for it, as you'll feel like you're driving a car half the size.
I'm not looking forward to any potential out of warranty repairs on the Boxer engine, as I've heard they're expensive and tedious, but if it's like my family's old outback, it'll run forever (300k and counting on that one, a 94!)"

The result is a jump from 2000 rpm to somewhere around 5000, which is not necessary. I would have it geared with 3rd, 4th and 5th in a more balanced way.

In general this is the perfect vehicle to buy, especially in this trim if you want a sporty SUV alternative. It sits up like a small SUV, handles like sports sedan, accelerates like a small turbo coupe, and brakes like a champion. I'm still in the break in period but I have a feeling once this time passes this car will truly shine. Car rides very smooth and balanced, and when bumps are transferred to the cabin they are controlled. Interior is pretty quiet with windows up and wind is buffeting noticeable with windows down. Engine is powerful in all ranges especially with boost up.","For me first is the engine. But I also love the huge sunroof, navigation which isn't bad, leather seats, stereo, fit and finish, sporty dials and red lighting, SI-Drive, and much more. SI Drive really changes personalities more than I thought it would. I also love that the 2.5XT w/NAV is rare. ","I would suggest more passenger space. A little more would be nice. The Navi could have a higher resolution screen, Memory Seats, Homelink and Bluetooth Standard, Autolocking Doors after 15mph, Full Size Spare, and Shift Paddles of the Legacy 3.0R, since the XT is above the Outback 3.0R."

The cruise control is anemic! The cruise control in my '99, the car raced up hills regardless of incline or elevation. In this car, it acts like ""the little engine who couldn't"". Climb  performance is affected by incline and/or elevation. On descent, it has trouble holding assigned speed. The cruise control is hit or miss in the mountains and on medium to steep inclines.

Since it was winter, I was starting to get sick of not making it up my hill to my house. So I looked at the Outback. It had no trouble driving through ~10 inches of snow during my test dive. So I got one.  It has been good, not great. It's not really fast, it handles pretty well and gets reasonable fuel economy for an AWD vehicle. AWD is great in the snow and the back holds lots of baby things. The HK stereo is pretty good, wish the audio controls on the steering wheel would control presets, and wish there was a sub control. Now that it is getting warmer, I am enjoying the large sunroof.","AWD, large sunroof, HK stereo, cargo room, seats are comfortable.","More rear legroom, more storage compartments, more gears, better fuel economy, HID's, more audio control, move center seatbelt and LATCH off of roof, IPOD integration, automatic headlights, power liftgate, and a little more power."

The Outback seems quieter and more powerful than my wife's 07 Forester, although both have the same 2.5 engine. The handling is very secure, and it's fun to drive with its tight steering. This car inspires confidence on the road. Varying my speed during the break-in period, I have managed to get 28.3 calculated mpg on my first two tanks. It will probably be better when I am not varying speed & I think that is very good fuel economy for an AWD vehicle.",The comfortable heated seats. The Outback has a nice combination of high ground clearance and low roof loading height - for ease of loading kayak. Other cars with high ground clearance are too tall. Controls are intuitive. Heated mirrors. Excellent headlights. ,"I would have preferred better tires than the Bridgestone Potenza 92A, but that will be easily solved at tire replacement time.

I have three dogs and with the 1 of the rear seats down they can move around and get comfortable.

I was shopping for a manual transmission sports wagon and someone suggested the OutBack Turbo.  I drove the car and was mildly impressed with the acceleration and ride so I decided to buy it.  I never expected to be in the situation I'm in now.  The tailgate rattles to the point that nobody wants to be in the car.  I can't turn the radio up loud enough to mask it.  It's been repaired 3 times and each time it rattles on the way out of the dealership.  Subaru has no suggestions.  Before you buy this car check out internet blogs about Outback rattles.

Mileage is as advertised; should not expect better with this power and AWD.  Now the down side.  After 5 days and 500km, the check engine light came on with flashing cruise and shift control lights.  The dealer had difficulty trouble shooting, but claimed to find the root cause after 2 days in the shop, replacing a solenoid that is used for control of one of the cams.

Prefer the multifunction display to be under the storage area instead of under the speedometer/tach.

IMO, this is a good alternative to those large SUVs because it's easier to navigate and park in the city.",Harmon Kardon radio and AWD. A good cruiser in the hwy.,Gas mileage. So far it's been as advertised but wish it could be better. For me however its a fair trade off for the AWD.

4.25,"So far, so good",Sneeral ,10/28/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"I've had my Outback for a month now and put on 1200 miles. It has exceeded my expectations so far.  I'm just out of a 2005 Nissan Murano and I expected that it would be a step down in almost all regards except gas mileage.  While it isn't quite as comfortable a ride and the quality of interior isn't quite as good, I've been pleasantly surprised at how well the car drives.  Except for pedal-to-the-metal acceleration, it honestly feels like a 6 cylinder not a 4.  Good torque and power delivery.  The handling is better than the Muranos, no doubt due to the considerably lower center of gravity.  Gas mileage so far is consistently 24.6 mpg through each of 3+ tankfuls.",Great gas mileage. Low tailgate makes for easy entry for my 2 dogs.,"Unlike others, I'm not especially impressed with the Harmon Kardon sound system.  There is an occasional faint buzz/rattle in the front passenger door."

4.875,More fun than expected,tulsa tom ,10/24/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This thing handles like a sports car, rides very nice and has quiet interior. I get 26-27 avg mpg using 87 reg. There's plenty of room to haul camping and fishing gear.",Fun to drive. good gas mileage. Almost a perfect car for me.,Better cup holders-arm rest. RDS radio. Auto door locks when in gear.

4.75,A fun car to drive,Dima ,10/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Having recently purchased an Outback, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun this car is - sporty handling, nice balance, very good 5-speed shifter.  It has much sportier character than one would expect from a wagon.  Recently, I had spent some time driving on semi-paved country roads, and was impressed with the suspension that made driving over the potholes and washed- out portions of the road bearable.  Although I do not get good mileage in the city, barely 20 mpg, it probably has more to do with my driving style.  On the highway, I am consistently in the 26-28 mpg range.    ","iPod connector, AWD, Harman Kardon stereo","Better material for the seats, they are drab and black and are made of stuff that one would expect on a base-level econobox. "

4.875,A WRX trapped inside a Volvo's body!,withdrew ,10/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We have a baby now so we needed something more versatile than our previous car ('02 BMW 325i) but just as sporty and fun to drive. The Subaru Outback delivers in every way. It's a great looking wagon inside and out, the build quality is solid and in 2.5 XT form, it's more powerful than our old BMW. I couldn't ask for more. The Outback is smooth and powerful and feels like a much more expensive car. It's very quiet and low-revving, I barely go over 4,000 RPM. There's plenty of room in the rear for a baby-stroller, groceries, luggage, golf clubs, etc. In our old sedan that was a major issue. The 5 speed manual is responsive and crisp. The 2.5 XT Limited is the best Outback available, period.","Very powerful yet retains above-average gas mileage. Very roomy and functional in the cargo department. Moonroof is huge, open the interior slide, it's like you're in a convertible. Aux input for an iPod in the center console, Harman Kardon audio. 5 Speed. Crash test scores. Reliable. Subaru AWD.","More storage space inside the cabin. Takes premium fuel (ouch) but still worth the trade-off IMO.  The steering wheel audio controls (up-down) do not cycle through presets, they only go up and down the tuner.  Donut spare tire. Child seat should mount center rear. No nav unless you get auto trans."

4.25,1st time Subaru owner,1st time Subaru ,10/04/2008,,,5,5,3,5,,4,5,3,4,"As a first time Subaru owner I did not know what to expect. It is the first car that I have owned that does not have a frame around the door's windows. Maybe I do not drive the way the others do but my mileage has been less than expected. My last car was a Toyota Highlander and did really well in the snow and not bad on mileage, so this new car has a lot to live up to.  I have owned others, Acura, Nissan, Audi and Toyota and, in my opinion, all had better initial quality. I am looking forward to the snow because I have heard great things.  ",The sunroof is huge and the Harman Kardon stereo is impressive. I like the safety rating that this vehicle gets. ,Can anyone design a car that gives you the AWD system with a good gas mileage rating?

4.875,My First Subaru,KentuckyRanger ,10/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I was disabled back in 06 and I need a car I know is going to last. After months of research the choice was obvious, I just wanted to wait till the 09s were out because they come standard with VDC which was well worth the wait after driving it. If you have any common sense you'll find it almost impossible to throw this car out of control. There's a store in the neighborhood that just sprayed their lot with sealant, very slick when wet. It rained yesterday morning so off I went. Around and around, I couldn't get this thing to spin out! Finally I just went in circles until the car went beyond what the tires could handle and I slid sideways.  20 Stars!!","Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) super gas mileage. Interior on the Limited is L.L.Bean even though it doesn't say it on the car. Harman Kardon stereo. 2.5i engine. I like it because it has plenty of fun factor power, has the reliability of a Mule and is very easy to work on. Turbo it for more fun. ","Well, let me nit pick a little. There aren't any rain channels so be careful opening the window on a rainy day. Bluetooth on such a high end stereo would have been nice too."

5,Update...,ywilson ,09/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is an update on my Soobie. Man I have to say that this is one great car. I have no complaints after 5400+ miles. No problems, great ride and the gas mileage is going up just like everyone said it would. My best to date was 33.7 MPG. I change my own oil and will do my others as well when the time comes. It is easy to work on this car if you are slightly mechanically inclined. Everything is reachable. This is going to be my 10 years car! Sorry Subaru but I am keeping this one for a long time. It is obvious it will last!!",All of them. I have no navigation by choice.,

4.75,Outback 2.5i New,YWilson ,07/12/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Well, this is my first Subaru. I am very happy with this purchase. The only thing is I drove off the lot with a tapping in one of my tires. Turns out a screw came loose and stuck in my tire. It was from the Tire Pressure Monitor. Strange. Still waiting on a special ""screw"" for this part. It's been 3 days. Otherwise the car is great. The dealer replaced the tire for free. I drive 100 miles a day and it get's better gas mileage as it breaks in. This will be a long term keeper for me.","Nice leather interior, good looks, smooth driving.",I can't think of anything I would do to this car.
