5,"Good, good, good.",Donte Wilson ,10/06/2015,4,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I purchased this car in October of 2013. I'm a younger guy, so personally I would want something faster, but when I was car shopping, I was in a hurry, I wanted a Mazda, and this popped up infront of me.I've had no problems at all with this car. Over 97,000 miles on it. Engine is fine. Tranny is fine (it's an auto, I wish it were a standard). Everything is fine. I do have a few minor mods to it, and I've had them on for most of the time I've had the car, exhaust, intake, upgraded springs, and it holds them up fine. I do take care of it. I only use top grade maintenance stuff. Full synthetic oil and lube and all that stuff.The only thing I dislike about this car is the weight. I am a person that likes a bigger, heavier sedan, but 170hp and 160trq in a 3,300+lb car is not very appealing at all. Its weight is also the reason why it gets poor fuel economy. I have about a 50/50 mixture of highway and city, and I get 20mpg on the dot. About 360miles per tank. Which, I don't have much of a problem with. My problem is the power. 170hp is fine. Especially for a family sized sedan, but 170hp in a 3,300lb is just stupid and unethical. It is rather quick in the 4cly family sedan category, but in an upper category, its falls very short. However, the handling is amazing.If you want something quick, I wouldn't completely reccomend this car, unless you're gonna shave some weight some how and/or forced induction. However, if you want everything a car can offer, this is the car.It's also great in the snow.I also over paid for my car, so don't let that price fool you. Be sure to check KBB and other consumers for a good price.",,

4,You need deep pockets if driven on salted roads!,Headed for Bankruptcy ,07/29/2015,2,4,4,,,2,4,4,3,,,"I completely agree with the other reviewer about how unsupportive the clamshell-shaped front seats are, with no lumbar support whatsoever -ouch! As well as the easily scratched plastic panel under the gearshift, and how the steering wheel blocks the speedo when properly adjusted. I bought it in Aug. 2012 with 47K miles. It now (July '15) has 102K+ miles due to long work commutes (on salted roads during rough Cleveland Winters). Which 2 brake repair shops tell me is the reason why I've had to replace the rear brake rotors/pads no less than 4 times, and the rear calipers no less than 3 times!! Add to this- $885 in 3 separate transmission service/repairs by the Mazda stealership over the past 5 months alone! Same reason given- corrosion from road salt. Combined with the fact that this car is downright scary/dangerous to drive on snow/ice covered roads- even with 4 new Kuhmo KH16 (pure crap) tires. (And I've been driving here since 1982) Other than that, I like it better (and is only slightly less scary driving in Winter than my '07 6i Touring Hatchback with the low profile tires was), but only after replacing the garbage factory door speakers w/ Alpine SPS-517 ones.",,

4.625,Bought the car new.,09mazda6gts ,07/04/2014,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I love the car and have no regrets buying it. There have been a few issues with the car. The battery went bad at two years. The rain sensing wipers are irritating. They will go into high speed in light rain. I bought nav but never use it, (I have Google Maps on my smart phone, much easier to use). I got locked in the car when my wife got out with the key and the doors locked when she walked away. I had to lay on the horn to get her to come back and let me out. The dealer had never heard of that. This wasn't a one time deal, it happens every time in the same situation. 63K on it now, replaced the tires and brakes. The power is great and the tranny is super smooth. Would buy again.","The car came loaded. Love the sunroof, traction control, stability control, BSM, seat memory, heated seats, XM radio, etc. Traction control has to be turned off when punching it from a dead stop. The wheels spin plenty, especially on half worn tires. This car is fast! I was going to try it at the strip. The transmission is so smooth, up shifting and down shifting that I didn't want to take a chance wrecking something just to see how fast it is. I never back down from a red light challenge though.","The wide wheels have no protection when touching the curb. If you touch the curb, it's the wheels that make first contact, not the tires.

It would be nice to have a way to disable the rain sensing wipers. It has to be auto sensing, on, or off. There is no intermittent setting.

Redesign the door lock system so the doors can be opened from the inside once they're locked. Can't believe there isn't a recall on this. There is a recall for the door hinge bolts falling out, haven't had that problem yet.

This is a great car and I intend to keep it for many more years. The reliability has been excellent."

The car has good performance and is comfortable. Overall I have not had major quality issues, but I do have some complaints centering around customer usability ease. First of all, the Key FOB is terribly difficult to open when you need to replace the battery, both to open and to replace the battery are quite hard to do. I have had problems with it not working at all lately, even when I replace the battery, and I will have to take it in. Second, the headlamps are almost impossible to get to so you can replace the bulbs. You have to go underneath the wheels, take out grommets, etc. Mazda needs to work on that.","Styling, performance","Improve Key FOB ease of use

I average 28MPG between highway and city usage. Very reliable. Very roomy and above average handling. Very safe. I was broadsided in it and it held up very well. I find Mazda's in general are certainly a cut or two above its competition. The stock speakers were a little weak, and I find the stock Xenon headlamps are not as powerful as they should be and are very expensive to replace. But this is a very satisfying car.","Good fuel economy, great build quality both mechanical and cosmetically inside and out. Comfortable and sporty...ish.

She loves the car and finally understands why some people are ""car people"". Lot's of interesting features (a switch to adjust the headlight aim, auto wipers, ac, lights, and locks. The car now has 43k miles and has only needed tires and brakes. It has never broken down, the interior and exterior are perfect. I would like the speedo to be larger with easier to see numbering (hard to tell if you are going 75, 72, etc.), and would like the gas mileage to be just a bit better. At 75 mph, the tach is showing about 2,500 rpm.This all said, the ride is comfortable and firm, seats are good.Update: The car now has 58k miles. I forgot to add that the red lighting for the buttons is hard to see at night. I wish they were white like other cars. Still very dependable. I just did rear brakes recently and it was very easy.

Something was draining it but no one knew what.  They said it was my 3rd party installed REMOTE STARTER (had that disconnected), THEN they said it was a ROOM FUSE(?).  Now I am being told it is a CONTROL MODULE. Brake light comes on on its own.  This car has been at dealership over two months total with no resolution.

The dashboard is very intuitive and easy to use. The GT has more features than I know what to do with. I especially love the blue tooth connection for my cell phone.

It was close to a strip model and I was never really satisfied with the car. Checked out the Mazda6 with the 4 cylinder and thought it was a nicely appointed car but the power was not what I expected. The dealer pulled around a Touring S model with the V6. Wow what a difference, I was sold as soon as I hit the acceleration. I got a great deal since they were having huge rebates and $1000 buyer loyalty credit.

It is a very comfortable and roomy car.  The roomy backseat makes this a great family sedan.  I was very surprised that I was able to get rubber in second gear.

Now after over 8,000 mi and traveling from Cal to Ala. and back I'm still impressed. It's a combination of capabilities - on curvy mountain roads it's a sports car; when passing up hill on a two lane road it's a hot rod; when hauling people it's a roomy, comfortable, relaxing ride.  What was most surprising was the gas mileage - better than advertised.  I get 21 and a half doing 50-50 town and country, and driving cross country with hours at 75 and 80 mph I averaged just over 27 mpg.","The power, responsiveness,comfort on 600 mile driving days.

The V6 engine is fantastic. Smooth as silk. And doesn't have the annoying cylinder shut down like the Accord V6.  Build quality is very solid and the ride feels great. Handles better than the Camry.  The bonus has been the mileage. Thus far we have been getting 22 combined with at least 75% city driving. ",Blind Spot Monitoring is great.

IMHO the newer Passats just are not as pleasing.  Mileage on country back roads is about 30.  Oh yes, the interim cars I had were Acura TSX and Saturn Aura.  Sorry, just no emotional connection with either.  Do try a 6.  Price is right, and you will not be disappointed.  I have come to like the car more, the more I drive it.

I wrote in my initial review we loved the car and hoped it would be as reliable as all of our other Mazda's have been.  Switched oil to Mobil 1 synthetic at the first change.  We average 22.4 around town and 28.3 on the road.  The car is as good as our 04 as it is rock solid, totally reliable but it is more comfortable than our 04 Mazda6.  It is a great car and we love it.  The V-6 has more than enough power and I find the fuel economy pretty fair.

I looked at the Accord, Camry, Altima, Fusion, and Jetta - Mazda 6 is at the top of its class. The only other car I was considering was the Accord, but I found the Mazda to have better overall value for the money, and the exterior/interior styling is a bit better.  The speed, ride, and handling of this car is excellent.  I find myself taking fast turns for no reason because it's simply just fun to do.  The quietness of the car is very good - my dad, who has drives Mercedes, was even impressed with the quietness.  If you're looking at the Touring model, I would highly suggest the convenience package - excellent value for the money.","Convenience package with blind spot monitoring, bluetooth phone/audio, rain-sensing wipers, and auto headlights.

Interior design and room: Only the Accord has more room, but the Mazda6 GT definitely has the best options...bluetooth, blind spot monitoring, top quality interior workmanship for this class, and an awesome audio system. ",Exterior and interior design...I get a lot of compliments on this car. Zoom! The V6 is incredible and the handling is fantastic for this class. Bluetooth. I set this up very easily. Audio system plays MP3s off of a CD. Blindspot monitoring is a great safety feature. Controls on steering wheel.,"Speedometer is not big enough, and runs to 160MPH!  There is only about an inch of dial from 60 to 80MPH...cut the max to 140 and make the speedo radius larger. Tone down the front fender swells just a tad...a little bit too exaggerated. More console space...cramped...need cubby for for phone. "

The ride is superb, and the electronics are awesome..especially the push-button start and the blind spot monitoring system. We're getting 27-29 MPG with the 2.5 4 and I know it will improve with age.

4.75,A Great Value Without Compromising! ,C.M. ,01/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"After considering both the six and four cylinder engines, I decided to purchase an i touring (4 cylinder) with the moonroof/Bose package and the convenience package. The car has almost all the features of the grand touring but costs much less, and it is a joy to drive.  The 2.5 liter 4cyl is peppy enough for normal city and highway driving yet offers reasonable gas mileage for such a large car. I have no problems merging or passing on the interstate.  The interior is phenomenal - very well thought out, comfortable, and beautiful, especially at night.  I test-drove most of the competitors, and I found the Mazda to be a far better value (size, comfort, features, etc.) than the competition. ","My favorite features have to be the advanced keyless entry, push-button start, xenon headlights, bluetooth hands-free setup, blind spot monitoring (this system is surprisingly accurate and helpful), and the Bose sound system. I also love how customizable these options are to my preferences. ","While still very comfortable, I think the front driver's seat could be slightly more firm for longer drives. That's about it."

Can be a bit slow off the stop line, but the 4 cyl flies nicely on the highway once at speed. Convenience package is a must to get rid of the Buick like upholstered door trim.

We have owned it for 5 months, (8000 miles), and have loved every minute. The 4 cylinder has plenty of zoom-zoom, and gets good gas mileage. We average 26-28 mpg, and are pretty heavy on the pedal. Highway trips we get 31-32 mpg. Often while driving, I will smile at my daughter and say ""I love this car"". The grand touring would have been nice, but we couldn't justify the extra cost.","Sexy look (black - with a spoiler), fun to drive, good mpg, very comfortable. I was astounded at how well it drove in winter weather - great handling, and I felt as safe as when driving my Jeep. I also love how it senses your hand to unlock the doors - no fumbling for keys in the rain :) ","There are only 2 cupholders in the middle, & the center console is not easy to get to while driving.

It has excellent power in the V6, is extremely tossable with great balance for a front driver. Power is completely smooth and linear, and shifts are crisp.

Con: Biggest problem: Most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. If I drive longer than 20 minutes or so, my back and legs start hurting. I have tried every setting possible, without success.

I do both highway and city driving, and this car has a ride quality you would find in a larger sedan but with power and maneuverability when you want it. Where the Altima was harsh and noisy, the Mazda exudes confidence, handling all road surfaces with ease. From a style standpoint, you can't beat the aggressive stance and overall lines - borrowing cues from Lexus and Infiniti isn't such a bad thing, and the design is hands down nicer than Camry or Accord, and the ""happy face"" grille of the Altima. Fuel economy is about the same as the Altima - it's reasonable given the power and performance of the V6. ",There are a lot of great things about this car. Dashboard lighting and layout. Sound system. Xenon headlights. Dual zone climate control. Throaty exhaust note when you feel the need for some Zoom.,"Very little to find fault with.

Every year Mazda just gets better and better, this current 2009 Mazda6 is the biggest bang for the buck BY FAR overall. Mine is the Mazda6I Grand Touring 4-cyl with the optional Moonroof & Bose Pkg. I owed 10k on my previous M6 & traded up for the new '09. I need to mention... 130,000 miles with not one single problem, just tires brakes. With that excessive mileage, the bluebook value had me under about 4 grand. Times are tough right now, so the dealer was kind enough to pay it off and not jack the MSRP price of the new, do the math 4$$$ shaved. Oh,BTW, 30MPG baby!","The whole is equal to the sum of its parts. But if I had to pick just one, the 10 speaker 375 watt stereo is awesome!",Yeah right...

4.875,Great car to drive.,gorest ,11/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Performance wise this car has more than enough zip and agility to make any ride to the local grocery store a treat.  On the highway the throttle is not as responsive as one might think and the hesitation of the automatic gear box will take a second or two to pick up.  The lower profile Michelin tires are comfortable but bumps and ridges in the road can definitely be felt.  The interior is probably what turns me on the most with great dashboard controls and information that is very useful.  I love the miles remaining on tank display.  BSM is a huge plus and a great safety feature.  The info button is tough to get to while driving.  In all this was one of my favorite decisions in a car.,Fuel information display.,None I can think of.

We liked the styling of the 2009 Lexus IS250 a lot and did a side by side comparison. The bottom line: a loaded 6 versus a loaded IS250 was $7800 less even after getting a deal offer on the Lexus. The IS still didn't have all the features available with the 6. The choice was simple then. Driving the car shows that the Zoom Zoom hasn't been lost. It is just fun to drive, gets good gas mileage and has all the toys you would ever want in a car. The proof is in the drive. Don't buy a car without test driving the 6. It drove better than the IS and we are thrilled.","Interior styling and options. I like the front and side views. My wife likes the back.

When looking to replace my Mazda 3 (manual), I looked at many different vehicles, but in the end came back to the Mazda 6. The 2.5 has plenty of get-up and go for everyday driving.

Enjoyed that car except 4 cyl was not enough for summer driving because of AC system takes power from engine.  Mazda got it right this time. Driving new 09 model for a week now, already see a lot of improvements. Torque is much better even with AC on. Transmission is much smoother when shifting. Interior design improved dramatically. More roomy. Dash board has few new fitures but again I have basic package cant help you there. I do have auxiliary input that allows me to connect my iPod, very cool. Sound system is awesome, 8 speakers and subwoofer standard. Trunk is very big, could fit my golf bag in the old model, this one is fine.",,

4.25,Not bad but still short of Camry quality,Rob ,08/15/2008,,,5,5,4,3,,4,4,4,5,"The all new 6 is a very attractive car and for the price its loaded with features compared to Accord and Camry.  It sporty than even the Altima with a smoother nicer ride than that car but not as smooth as Camry.  Two issues I had.  One after test driving there was a strong burning plastic smell.  Not the typical ""break in"" smell you have with new cars.",Overall design and look.  Fun to drive.  Smart key.  Dash and instrument layout and color.,More refined base engine.  CVT is a must!  Do away with the keyhole cover (looks tacky).

4.875,Just Got 1st 2009 Mazda 6,tuan ,08/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"after doing research for countless hours, days, i finally decided to get the 2009 mazda 6 sedan. The car is beautiful, from outside to inside. I have test drove the new Accord, the new Altima, and I had the new 2009 Camry SE. None of them compare to this car. This car looks better then them all and drives better. I am a little skeptical on the reliability issue, since it isn't Toyota, Honda, or Nissan. But regardless, this car is awesome. it has things that only luxury cars like the BMW or Benz has. I believe this car will put Mazda on the same map with the Hondas, Toyotas, and Nissans. ","Everything is nice about this car, from the outside to the inside. It drives really nice too. Smooth and more then enough power to accelerate or pass other cars.","Honestly, for the price, you can't ask for more. The only really complain I have is, if any, is that there is no rear vent for passengers. The Camry and Altima have that. "

4.875,Brought the First 2009 Mazda 6 ,Hoysum81 ,08/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just got the new 2009 Mazda 6 yesterday. it was the first one brought in the whole New York. I got the S Grand Touring, the V6 one. It's a beautiful car. I was about to get the Nissan Altima, but after hours, hours of research, I decided to wait for the Mazda 6, and it was definitely worth the wait and all the time I put into researching cars. I have test driven Accords, Altimas, Camrys, Acuras, and none of them drive better then the 2009 Mazda 6. besides the driving, the car is beautiful from outside to inside. Everyone that is looking for a new car should definitely give the 2009 Mazda 6 a look. I believe this will change the way people look at Mazda cars now. ","Everything from the outside to the inside. Just beautiful. Also, the driving experience of course.","for the price, you get what higher end luxury cars have, so no complaints. "
