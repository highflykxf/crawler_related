5,Safety first,Sarah ,08/27/2016,5,4,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I was in an accident last night in my 2009 Jeep liberty. We are all okay but got hit from the back while we were at a dead stop and the other driver of a E350 van plowed into the back of us sending us into another vehicle. My back window blew out not in, I felt so safe in this vehicle and I would not want to have been in anything else. I'm so happy I bought this vehicle. It was tough and amazing in the snow. The sky slider was good after we had a dealer fix it. If you live in NY NEVER buy a vehicle from Armory Garage in Albany. My air bags did not go off and they should have, but that is okay because it probably would have made things worse. This was my first vehicle ever and probably the best one I have ever had. I highly recommend the jeep liberty.",,

It will not ride like a car based crossover. That said, it actually does pretty darn good on regular roads.Our Liberty has 90k miles and the drive train has been solid. No squeaks or rattles. Overall our Jeep has been reliable. We've owned Hondas and other brands so being objective here. Items that will likely be a problem sooner or later on the Liberty include automatic climate controller, trans cooler, and totally integrated power module (when this goes bad the car seems haunted). Wife loves driving the Liberty year round. We would buy another one.","Looks like a Jeep should, very useful on or off road, decent towing capability (5000 lbs), and I like that the engine sounds just like the old Slant 6..an engine that almost could not be killed. 

Our Limited is pretty quiet inside especially for an SUV.","Like every other interior since almost the day Daimler bought Chrysler, the interior materials are cheap plastic in a lot of areas. Fiat is fixing that problem but unfortunately making Jeeps a lot less, well, Jeep-like."

We've got 40k miles on it, and the transfer case control module has issues. The steering rack sprung a leak, rear tire pressure sensor went out causing everything to shut down. Couldn't use 4x4 with that out, and the rear hatch light comes on with the dome light at times. Rides like a rock, but turns on a dime. There is only a few inches of suspention travel, so don't get too crazy off road becuase it is not forgiving","Good traction control and amazing 4x4 on and off road....when they work. The jack and tire iron location is very discreet, secure, and organized. There is a trough for the oil to drain from the oil filter, which is nice.","Tow hooks should be standard (especially on a trail rated vehicle), hook style rear wiper for easier replacement, more suspension travel, get rid of the Goodyear Wranglers as stock tires (they're junk). Do something different with the lug nuts because those caps fall off and the tire iron with the vehicle is useless on a cap-less nut. The oil filter is a royal pain to get to. I know there's a better way to do that."

I know that this is an SUV, but 13mpg  in the city and 17mpg on the hwy is pathetic. This is a midsize SUV. I don't beat on this car.

I feel very fortunate to have purchased a new vehicle during such hard times and decided to give the American car companies another chance. This is my first Jeep and so far I pretty impressed. Quality and workmanship have definitely improved but the amount of product has lessened. Metal and materials have taken a back seat to technology. One of the reasons I chose Jeep was for safety.  A full frame,rear wheel drive,and superb styling brought some of the important basics back to an industry that has become ""boring"".

The Jeep handles very well on the highway or back roads. I was concerned over the reviews reporting how under powered the Liberty is... this is very mis- leading, the Liberty has plenty of zip, just not the rocket that some cars are these days.

I have a color called Black Pearl? There seems to be a sun spot on the hood small but does not look finished.The biggest headache of them all is Jeep does not offer a loaner.,I cant afford to put the Jeep in the shop for 3-5 days like they say they need. I have called 5 dealerships and all say the same thing. I love the Jeep please don't get me wrong. It is sharp and sharp looking.

I suggest that the company pay for the undercoating that should be there to help keep the Jeep lasting longer and not charge an extra price.
