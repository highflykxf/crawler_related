It's really quick, smooth, refined, and luxurious. It's extremely quiet inside and the interior has nice materials. The seats have bad leg support-my legs hang off of the end of the drivers seat. Otherwise it's extremely nice. It does handle pretty bad, however, with a slightly tippy feeling and some of the worst steering of any car I've driven. It feels like a video game with no feedback  and is scary in the rain especially. The car also lacks Bluetooth and USB or aux imports, which is unacceptable in a 2009 luxury car.

The RX has plenty of power (thank you again to the WI State Patrol officer for being so understanding), plenty of comfort and is ideal for long or short trips. Probably obvious, but make sure you use only synthetic oil.

Had it now for about a month and we've taken two trips.  Super comfortable and WAY more fuel efficient than our original RX.  Also, the turning radius is greatly improved.   I think the best part of the whole deal though is that after 125,000 trouble free miles, the Lexus dealer gave us 26% of our original purchase price.

There was also an air leak on the driver door which made it sound like the door was not closed all the way.
