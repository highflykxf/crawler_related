4,So much potential!,Carson C. ,09/16/2016,3,3,4,,,2,5,4,4,,,"I purchased my 2009 Volkswagen Jetta S in 2013.  It was a certified used vehicle purchased from Volkswagen Van Nuys in Van Nuys, CA, and it only had 27,000 miles on it.  Since I've owned the car, the resale value has tanked.  It now has about 85,000 miles, and is only worth about $8,500 max (and that's including all the upgrades).  I've had many electrical issues with the car...such as: 1.) In 2014, the fuse panel under the engine melted, 2.) In 2016, my front driver seat almost caught fire, as the seat warmer burned through the seat & caused black marks...luckily, I noticed before it turned into a fire, 3.) In 2016, my fuse panel inside the car melted.  Although Volkswagen considers some of these ""safety issues"", they will refuse to take care of the problem...which is why it is unfortunate, but I will never purchase another Volkswagen again.  I will give this car credit -- it handles very well.  The only other negative about this car, is that I feel as though the car goes through gas a lot faster than it is supposed to.  I even borrowed a 2015 Volkswagen Jetta while mine was being repaired, and the car would say ""125 miles until empty""...5 miles later, it would read ""110-115 miles until empty"", and so forth.  I would not recommend this car to anyone over 5'8"".  I am about 5'6""/5'7"", and even I sometimes will hit my head getting in and out of the car.",,

2,Love hate relationship,ronald ,09/11/2015,,,3,,,,,4,,,,The 2009 TDI sportwagon.  I love about everything about this car except reliability and that is a show stopper.  Virtually every system has had major overhauls except the engine.  I guess I have grown spoiled driving about a dozen Toyotas over the years as they are reliable and run forever.  Expect to pay the cost of the car for repairs during the first 120K for this model.   The least reliable and most expensive to repair automobile I have owned.   I will never purchase another VW.,,

The turbo on the diesel grenaded, causing not only all the damage in the turbo, but also the exhaust system (which had been redesigned and you had to buy the newer version). Very expensive repair. Asked VW to help, but there comment was that it was out of warranty, your on your own. The car was three years old at the time. They also made the comment that I had put a lot of miles in a short time. Really, a diesel should be good for 300K+. At 140K miles, radiator starts leaking, and was replaced. Radiator fan had to be replaced as it liked to run until it ran the battery down. Now one of the glow plugs needs to be replaced, one of the rear window regulators, and the electric steering is humming.  With ""dieselgate"" now, the car is worth half than prior, and VW seems to be more concerned with saving their hide then customers. They don't even seem to really get it that the chicanery they did really is not justified because superior german engineering could not come up with a solution that was within their price point for producing the car.",,

I don't trust them to tell me the truth.After an dealership oil change I left on a long trip. 500 miles from home in the middle of nowhere, loud flapping noises from the engine compartment.

I had to pay to have the missing bolts replaced. Local home dealership denied to refund me the cost of the repair.It appears that it's a myth...Diesel engines are good for 100,000 's of miles.At 100,000 miles, the repair saga has begun.

4.75,Still Smooth Sailing After 5+ Years,jasonpdx ,03/20/2015,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"My 2009 TDI SE has treated me very well for over five years and 70K, and I am still happy with it. The build quality on this generation is really, really good (unlike the dumbed down start to the next gen after): the interior is premium and the exterior is quietly upscale and distinctive in a good way. Having heard from some about VW's prior reliability problems when I bought it, I wondered whether I'd be in for some unexpected bumps in upkeep.  But this car has been 100% reliable, with no time in the shop except for the regular maintenance, a new set of tires, and (just recently at 70K) a new pair of rear brake pads.  And I still get about 43 highway and low 30s city MPG-- above EPA.
","Excellent torque and sufficient power with high MPGs!

Ride is just a little sporty yet still very comfortable

Good looks that age well (I still get compliments, which is nice ;)

Quiet (TDI quieter on the road than gasser version)

DSG automatic is super fast

Upgraded sound system still sounds great

Heated seats

Good visibility

Letherette ages better than real leather

Good safety features (lots of airbags and good ratings)","Crawling at slow speeds with a DSG is a little lurchy (unavoidable with dual clutch automated manual but could be refined a bit more)

Maintenance costs at dealer are a little inflated

Even with cold weather package, cabin takes a good five minutes to warm up on cold days (again, comes with the territory with diesel, but supplemental heating element could be more powerful)

I had to install bluetooth for an extra $400! (Fortunately, VW fixed this oversight later I think)"

2.5,VW should give cars away for free and charge for repair. ,starzyd ,01/27/2015,,,3,4,1,1,,3,4,1,3,"The 09 TDI Jetta was the worst car I've ever owned. At 67,000 miles it fell into the exhaust manifold warranty and VW put an entire new system in my car at a value of $8,000.  At 78,000 miles the ABS system went out, AC stopped working, Exhaust system failed again, and transmission was slipping.  It needed $8,000 in repairs to keep running and was only worth that much for a trade in.  I prayed for months that someone hit me so I could dump this car as the trade in value was only $500 bucks with all it needed. I'm severely disappointed in VW.  This car cost $23k to purchase and within 4 and 5 years it needed $17,000 in repairs to maintain it barely running. Stay away from this vehicle! ",The diesel had a lot of get up and go.  It is a speedy little car to get around town. ,"Stay away from these cars unless you have endless amounts of income to put into repairs.  The exhaust on the new models is a nightmare. I wish it had a self destruct button. I would have loved to see this blow up to pieces.  Worst piece of crap I've ever owned. Expensive to maintain because of the diesel aspect. My suggestion is to stop making them until you can figure out how to make a good car.

3.375,Beware!,shallquist ,01/15/2015,,,3,4,3,2,,4,4,3,4,"This review is for the 2009, but based on my research affects all TDI models.  All TDIs have a High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) and they are prone to failure when the diesel fuel gets contaminated.  My Diesel somehow got water in the diesel and apparently based on the rust in the tank this had been an on going problem.  At 107000 miles the fuel system had to be replaced to the tune of $5,800 dollars.  Apparently diesel fuel standards in the US are lower than that of Europe and VW hasn't taken that into consideration.

Please CONSIDER this when purchasing.","Automatic Trip computer is very useful.  I like the panoramic sunroof, but have begun to dread it since the drain tubes clog often and water ends up collecting in foot wells.",Fix the HPFP and put in a system to detect bad fuel!

4.75,A very good car and it requires maintenance,redlude ,05/21/2014,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,5,4,I have 100K miles on the car & have been very happy. I had an electrical issue. It wasresolved. Maintenance costs can be cut in half by purchasing the parts yourself & then have a reputable non dealer garage install them. My chosen garage specializes in German vehicles and were rated very highly. I use Lucas and Stanadyne Diesel fuel treatements for injector cleaning & additional injector/fuel pump lubrication. I am gearing up to change my timing belt. I am going to pay $700 instead of the $1200 mentioned on another review here.I researched and purchased the parts online and provided them to my mechanic. I expect to see many miles more.... God willing and the creek don't rise ,"Fuel Economy of course!! However, the interior is nice and well designed. Typically German IMO. I love the heated seats during the colder months. The trunk space is amazing for a car that size. In spite of some of the reviews in here, my car has been very reliable, sure there some quirks but I can live with it as it is.
After the turbo kicks in, I love the rapid and smooth acceleration as well.","Agree the air conditioner could do better and the turbo lag has proven to be significant, if I do not keep that in mind while i am driving.
I usually try to keep the RPMs up a bit and that normally keeps the lag at bay."

It requires regular maintenence every 80,000 miles tat makes one think they are buying a new tranny. Add to that a new timing belt at 90,000 miles that will run another $1200. So you see, you pay for that economy. I love the car but will not buy another. Oh yeah, a faulty fuse holder for one bank of headlights is another $520.00.Last maintenance service, computer indicated a ""possible"" cracked exhaust manifold, along with some other suggested items. Estimated cost to repair all, $7,200.00. Car unsafe to drive; could stop at any time. Since cost of repairs was about what the car is worth, I declined. Had the car repaired locally for $400.

Overall, a very nice upscale compact that offers a lot of value and quality for the money.","VW customer service and support needs a lot of improvement. Dealerships are indifferent, technicians are under-trained, and VW corporate just doesn't seem to care. If VW is serious about running with the big dogs (Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Chevy, Ford), the entire organization needs a complete culture overhaul starting at the top focusing on extraordinary customer service. The car itself is OK, but service is abysmal when needed. Furthermore, VW really misread theirmarket when the dumbed-down the 2012 Jetta & Passat. They ruined & cheapened 2 great cars thinking this is what we want. A better support organization is what we want. Not cheap cars. Lexus has already proved this."

Safe, comfortable, good handling in snow, and amazing MPG (44 hwy, 37 city over 20K miles). However, the TDI has a faulty high pressure fuel pump design and complete failures are showing up all over the US due to the poor quality of US diesel compared to Europe. Bottom line? at 21K my pump failed and shot metal particles through the entire fuel system. It was all replaced (tank to injectors) at a cost of about $10K. This was covered by warranty and the dealer was great-- but there is nothing to prevent it from happening again, out of warranty. And who needs are car that may self-destruct without warning at any time?

It has many squeaks and rattles, which seems unusual for a newer car.

4.5,Fuel Filler Issue,Roady ,07/05/2010,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,5,4,I like my TDI very much but there is an issue with finding a small automotive diesel fuel fill nozzle in rural areas.   The big nozzles used at truck stops and most small town gas stations that sell diesel will not fit in the TDI fuel filler opening.  When in dire need I have held the big nozzle against (not in) the opening and slowly added fuel.  This is hard to do because the truck flow rate is also much higher than the VW can accept - so an overflow onto your shoes is very likely.  Because of several bad experiences I always start looking for an automobile diesel pump way in advance of running out.  McGyver-types will figure out how to survive but this is something that needs consideration,Very stable at highway speeds.

Only about one (non-truck stop) station in five has a diesel pump, and it is often off to the side and not under a canopy so larger vehicles can access it.

I drive ~350 miles/week, mix of highway and city, and average appr 41 mpg w/ a fairly heavy foot. My best is 47.5 on a trip from Bham to Nashville. The TDI's torque is impressive, and the turbo spool/blowoff sounds cool too! The interior is well built (even though I had an annoying rattle in the rear C- pillar, dealership fixed on 20k maint. visit). I appreciate the modest but functional interior layout. Even the sunroof is well designed! The gearbox shifts well and engages fluidly. My only beef w/ the car is the lack of option for cloth seats and the spongy brakes. ","Fuel economy (main motivation for purch), surprising performance, interior material quality, dash layout, very supportive seats (almost thought they were too small at first, but I love them now). Drives just as well at 100mph as it does at 50. Huge trunk. Did I mention fuel economy?","Perhaps a reconsideration of speaker placement is in order - the sound comes all from beneath you.

4.5,The US needs more diesels like this,Rickallen ,01/26/2010,,,5,4,4,4,,5,4,5,5,"I bought this car as a replacement for a hybrid that just didn't cut it for me.  The VW makes up for all of the performance and comfort trade-offs of a hybrid but with little penalty to the MPG's.  I actually average about the same or better with diesel than I did with the hybrid - about 39 mpg over the life.  Acceleration of the line makes passing slowpokes easy and squirting in and out of stop and go traffic is a breeze since it gives you ""right now"" torque.   My only disappointments have been some annoying rattles, an audio system that gives me headaches, and no aux in if you have the ipod adapter.  Other than that, I can't complain.  I think I'm spoiled for anything but diesel.","Torque, seating position (I'm 6'4""), highway handling, DSG transmission, 3- blink turning signal for lane-changes (simple, yet genius), trunk size(plus it opens on struts, not goose necks that eat trunk space)","Better cupholders, ipod control that actually lets you control the ipod (not just cycle thru your playlists), LED tail-lights and DRL's, AWD option, thicker glass, more sound insulation in floor and firewall, bring the new 7- speed DSG to the TDI."

4,Well built car that is fun to drive also,jet25s ,12/30/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,I have had the car for three months and it has been good to me as a daily commuter car.  The engine pulls hard from the low rpm range and the manual transmission shifts very smoothly but with assurance.  The suspension is dialed between comfort and handling so it is not very cushy but it has more body roll than I would like.  It feels as quick as my 2500lb Miata in the straight line acceleration.  I have autocrossed the Jetta and it pleasantly surprised me in its stock form with the all season tires.  The rear view mirror developed a crack this morning when the heat came on when it was frozen.  I am hoping it will be covered under warranty...,1. Standard heated seats! 2. Smooth revving capable 5 cylinder engine. 3. Very quick rear defroster. 4. Clean and ergonomic interior layout. 5. Standard Heated exterior mirrors.,1. The seat bottom is tilted back too far so it is uncomfortable on my lower thigh area when making gear shifts.  I had to add metal bushings under the rear bolt holes of the seat rails to raise the rear end.  2. The radio reception is bad. 3. Put thicker sway bars and reduce the body roll.

We were between this, the Altima, Fusion, Accord, Sonata and Elantra Touring.  This car offers a lot of options on the base model and good acceleration for its class.  While not quite a ""pocket rocket"" as I would have liked, it definitely is a fun car to drive.  The Mazda 3 was sportier but this just feels like a nicer car.  This is a very comfortable car and is just big enough for my wife and I.  I felt the midsize cars were just too large for city driving.  The Jetta is an excellent city cruiser.  It performs quite well in the snow.  The Jetta has a lot of character. I just hope it holds up as well as my Focus.",I like the heated seats and mirrors for those Chicago winters.  The traction and stability control have been handy.  The ergonomics of this car are untouchable by anything in the price range.  I love the overall comfort of this car.  The fit and finish of the Jetta is excellent except for hubcaps.,Could use a little more sound dampening as highway trips can be a little on the loud side on unrefined pavement.  I would also like to see a little better fuel economy (I average 23 city 31 hwy in mostly city driving).  Hubcap fell off and was not covered under warranty.  Make power seats standard.

My previous car was a Volvo T5 S40  and I must say the TDI has plenty of power.  Diesels have so many benefits but they also offer great power at any speed.  Always wanted a VW but didn't like the quality of the gas motors.  Decided to take the leap from Volvo (longtime owner--last 4 cars were S60 and S40 turbos...well one Acura TSX in that time also) after having some quality issues.  I am very impressed with the quality of materials and how the car fits together.  The ride is firm and sporty.  It drives like a front wheel drive version of the BMW 3 series (if only the Jetta was RWD it would be the perfect car!)  Average 40- 43 mpg.,"2.0L diesel motor, interior/exterior looks, comfort, power, fuel mileage is GREAT, loads of Torque, Bluetooth, iPod, handling and safety rating.  Very solid feeling car.  WOULD BUY AGAIN WITHOUT HESITATION.  Probably the smartest car purchase I have ever made.","Improve bluetooth handsfree function (my Acura was much better at this), stereo is good but not great, automatic lights (2010 has them).

However, the dealer experience leaves a lot to be desired. I've been told by the service dept multiple times that ""VW doesn't cover squeaks and rattles after six months"". I made an appt & dropped my car off first thing in the morning for a routine 90 minute service. Four hours later I telephoned for a status and was told that customers who wait there are given preference and they'd call me back in an hour.

We can drive from Kamloops to Vancouver in 6th without much problem.  It has loads of passing power.  Even with hills and high speeds combined fuel use is 6.7 L/100km.   That said, vehicle totally failed at 1000km and had to be towed to a VW dealer for repair.  The problem was identified as a leaking turbo hose.  This was fixed but the engine warning light subsequently came on frequently until the engine computer was ""re- mapped"".  Carpet in rear is coming out from the interior sill and the carpet on the back of the rear seats is falling off.  This is all scheduled for repair but is a bit disappointing.",It's got to be the engine/ gearbox combination.  Great power and the ability to eat long and steep hills without losing speed.,"As noted by another reviewer, the smell of heated windshield washer fluid in the cabin, following use of the wipers/washers, is pretty unpleasant.

The airbags didn't hurt me.  I was fine, and I was lucky, but I think this car kept me safe because it pretty much crunched in to absorb all the impact.

Very smooth shifts while accelerating, and seems to find the correct gear for each situation.  However,at very low speeds there is too much engine braking due to no fluid coupling so some small amount of lurching is sensed. The interior is very attractive and seems well made.

4.875,Jetta TDI - What a car,tdibeliver ,05/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,After waiting for 4 months I got my TDI in early December. We have about 6500 miles on it now and have had no problems whatsoever. We usually drive around town averaging 36 to 38 MPG. I drove on a highway trip of about 200 miles and got 49.6 MPG keeping the speed to no more than 65. We really enjoy driving the car. It handles well and is very comfortable. The 6 months of free satalite radio was a plus I didn't expect. The height adjustable seats are great. I'm a little taller than the wife and with both of us driving the car it makes it easier to get a comfortable driving position. We really enjoy the car. If your thinking about buying one check it out! ,"Acceleration, Sat. radio (sounds pretty good to us especially the sat), heated seats, 3yr 36K free service, no tune ups - ever, sunroof, driving it, the ride and of course the MPG",Does the multifunction display have to be red?? A full power seat & mirrors with a memory option for different drivers would be nice to have available.

And that is the only thing that will make you realize it is a diesel. However maintaining speed in traffic is annoying. Especially when braking. It seems the auto transmission wants to help slow you down. This should make the brakes last , but a real pain trying to maintain driving distance.   The cruise control must have been designed by Mr Volkswagen's kid. Long over due for modernization.   The wipers are backwards to every one else's.   Fuel cap is on right side, real handy AARGH ","Quiet engine, even quieter than the gas during normal acceleration.   Got 40mpg on the only tank I used before trading back to Sonata. That was 200 miles hwy and about 300 city.  ",  Go back to torque converter type transmission. I am afraid VW tendency to be different is loosing as many customers as it is gaining.   The speed control is the most backward of all the quirks.

I would say they are spot on!! this is a very fun to drive car amazing torque and handling zipping around in city is a blast do not under estimate the low end torque you absolutely do not need to rev to pass or make a quick lane change.  averaged about 4o MPG on a 800 mile HWY trip cruising 65-75 mph, still breaking in, I heard it takes about 5000 miles for diesel to just break-in","MPG, solid feel, and the fact reducing my carbon foot print on the environment  $$ Tax savings :))","Stereo could be better, feels too loud and noisy start giving headaches after a while  Suspension too sporty but cornering on my X5 TRUCK makes me feel more in control Suspension could be softer for a diesel car, as MPG and cruising becomes important "

5,I love this car!,Ereimjh ,04/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love the ESP which makes winter driving less scary for me: a noticeable improvement on my last car, a Sentra that performed horribly in winter weather, no matter how careful I was. It will even let you know when the tire pressure is low. Throw in heated seats,  heated sideview mirrors, an outside temperature gauge and a nice, non-plasticy interior and the 2009 Jetta becomes a classier economy car. I stick with premium gas. Yeah, I know it's more expensive but it all comes out in the wash. The fuel efficiency on premium is noticeably better and I can actually accelerate up steep inclines even without putting the transmission into S.  It's comfy, too. Instant comradery with other VW drivers.","ESP, apparently standard on all 2009 VW models, is great! The sensors adjust tire rotation when one wheel slips (in winter weather, for instance) and synchronizes rotation to improve traction or it will apply slight breaking pressure to the wheel if slipping when accelerating to provide stability.","I rather like the boxy look of the older Jettas from around the 03/04 model years. The shiny,silver front end makes it look a bit like a  my car has a bib. The power windows seem a bit touchy, opening all the way when I only want them to open a little. a minor complaint. "

The VW wagon ticked both boxes, and was actually the roomiest wagon in this price range.  If you can swing for the diesel, do it, but the base 5-cylinder has quite a bit to recommend it.  Throw in standard heated seats and a telescoping wheel and you get a very refined and functional package for not a lot of money.  Tall guys fit well, and legroom in the back is decent.  Spring for the winter floor mats.  Niggles are few.  First gear is too short, and gas mileage isn't what it should be for a car this size.  Still, I'd buy it again.","Great stereo, fit and finish is out of its price range.  Wheel has a nice heft in character with the torquey motor and stiff suspension.  Very little body roll on a turn.  Storage and seats are well thought out.","HUGE blindspot in the driver's B pillar, next to your head.  Makes lane changes a little woolier than should be on a car this size.  Radio turns off when you remove the key, should be when you open the door.  Throttle on low-speed starts is a little abrupt, could be the car's age."

The DSG transmission is extremely smooth and a good investment.  The ride is smooth and comfortable at highway speeds.

My reliability rating is based on only 1 week of ownership, but so far so good.  Since nothing has gone wrong, I give it a 10.",TDI TurboDiesel is amazing.  And so far I love the DSG transmission.  It's the best of both worlds.  Expect an easy 45 MPG on the open road if you keep your speed down to about 60.,"The factory ""premium"" sound system is horrible, probably mostly due to bad speakers.

A very practical wagon with loads of cargo room, interior design that's far more like an Audi than  Honda or Subaru, and the gas mileage of a Civic! The car feels wonderful on the road - solid and much more powerful than 140hp would lead you to believe. Yes you pay more for diesel fuel, but with a 40-cent spread between unleaded and diesel in NY, you still come out ahead, and put less CO2 in the air to boot.

My wife wanted me to buy a Civic but relented to my choice of car.  Unfortunately, she drove it to work last week and now she wants it for her own.  The car is very comfortable to drive.  I can tell it was designed to drive the freeways for long trips.  You don't hear the engine at all at cruising speeds and you are at the peak torque @ 60mph.  At first start up, and at a stop sign, the signature diesel sound is there but very muted compared to a bigger oil-burner.  Finally, we are very pleased with the mileage.  At 1K odometer, we are getting low 40's highway, around 35 mixed driving.","Heated Seats, Fast shifting transmission (see improvements).  Wife loves the satellite radio.  Of course the fuel economy is a big winner as well!!","The DSG shifter slips (from sport mode) past ""Drive"" way too easily to neutral.  Also, I think it shifts ( at low speeds) about 500 RPM too early.  I'm sure this is to save fuel but the sound the gears makes me think I'm starting to near the threshhold to stall the car. "

The 2L turbo engine is sweet with strong response and quite decent mileage even if it does require premium. I try not to look to closely at the Consumer Reports reliability charts as all  German cars appear to be lacking but I previously had an '04 Jetta GLS that never skipped a beat in 50K miles! I have no reason to think this Jetta won't be just as reliable but time will tell.","Solid body structure, great balance of ride and handling, superbly responsive engine, and strong breaks.

Seats are comfortable and supportive. The VW TDI diesel is much quieter than I was expecting after previously driving a Mercedes diesel years ago.  Great Car all around so far. ,"Handles and drives like a BMW, gets great MPG, panoramic sunroof is a nice option, Sirius Sat radio standard, rear passenger airbags standard,  Wagen has great room for pets and cargo, wife loves the standard heated seats, TDI diesel engine is awesome.",Why no steering wheel controls for radio!

It is very fuel efficient, for those who have only managed to get in 350 or so miles, the mileage does improve drastically over time.  I average mid 40's for primarily 50 mph driving on country backroads, and high 30s in city driving.  I decreased my weekly gas bill for my Subaru from 180 dollars to my current 52.00 per week!  That cannot be beat, and it only requires one fill per week, with me driving 600 miles per week on average.  My only complaint is that I have 3500 miles so far, and the check engine light just came on.  The dealer has been very helpful, but I am a bit concerned that maybe they have not yet worked out the kinks in the new engine.","the Sound system is fabulous, with 6 disc CD changer, holds up to 18 presets on the memory, comes with Satellite radio for 3 months, has an ipod adapter/jack, very comfortable, very fuel efficient.  Fun car to drive!","I love VW, I used to have a new beetle, 1999, and loved that car too.  I have a real issue with their working out the quirks in their cars.

The only cars that came close in their standard configurations were the Nissan Sentra-S and Altima. The VW's features, handling, and interior quality were well above anything else I tested. Plenty adequate acceleration, torque-y little engine, great handling, and a well-crafted overall package.  It feels faster than it is, but that's good because it's really easy to misbehave in this car. A nice entry point into German-designed cars - sporty, solid, and wonderfully engineered. A classy commuter that's also fun to buzz the backroads with on the weekend.","Premium VII stereo package is pretty darned good for stock audio - solid bass and clarity even with windows down. Cabin fit-n-finish is excellent. Intelligent convenience features. Crisp, confident driving feel at all speeds. Really good driving position for me personally - car fits like a glove.","Better OEM tires (Turanza E400s are a bit noisy).

This one seems to be more refined, I had door rattles in my '04 model that couldn't be found by dealer.  Torque on the '09 is crazy! Very fun to drive. At hwy speeds, expect  ~40 Mpg. If you slow down to 55 ;), you can get 50 Mpg.  The MFD display is neat, as it tells you instant and average economy. Love my TDI - and get better mileage when I use B15 BioDiesel!

This car is a joy to drive and the mileage is fantastic.  I drove a friend's hybrid Camry, and a Prius, before testing the TDI.  There is simply no comparison.  Toyota's hybrids are great at what they do, but I couldn't imagine driving one on a daily basis.  This is my first VW, and I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the diesel option in the new Tiguan so my wife can have a little fun.

The first one was a 2003 1.8T w/ 180 HP which then traded for 2005.5 150 HP 2.5 L in which i drove  54,000+miles, a perfectly reliable car with the exception of burned out brake light when it was about 1 year old and a recent burned headlight. So overall, i'd say that this new Wolfsburg is the best overall. It has huge amount of power. I love the way the engine sounds in the freeway when I'm speeding up a bit. I got the red Salsa and it's great. Although i do miss a few features that the previous model but it's okay. As far as fuel efficiency, it's not that great especially during aggressive driving and driving up the hill. But it's better than driving an SUV.

I can feel the quiet diesel engine purring under the hood as it speeds effortlessly down the road. The firm ride adds to the feel that I'm driving a tamed beast! Months of research convinced me that no other car gives you the value the TDI offers.

Outside the car design just looks sharp, love the unique wheels.
