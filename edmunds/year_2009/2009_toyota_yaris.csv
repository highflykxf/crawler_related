Bought new and have put 117,000 miles on it as I commute 30 miles each way to work, mostly freeway. MPG is pretty darn good at about 33 in winter and 36 summer.I change the oil regularly and the only thing I had to replace other than tires and wipers was the battery. The problems are that Toyota messed up with the instrument panel. The horrible Amber color is hard to see at times and dims when you put the headlights on. At night its not an issue, but daytime it can be.I live 6 miles off the highway on a very curvy and hilly road.  It's great around corners, but the long steep grade isn't so good.

Its been just under 2 years and I can report a little more since I first submitted a review. This car is so roomy for such a small car. I have rented a bunch of cars on travel and all of them all less roomy than the Yaris hatchback. I just rented a Corolla and it was so crampedcompared to my Yaris.The fuel mileage is fairly consistent. I get about 39 MPG on the interstate and 31 around town. I drive 70 MPH on the interstate so getting almost 40 MPG with the A/C on is really good. The car has very little road noise. I do notice that around 70 MPH, it is a little difficult to hear conversations on my cell phone, but it isn't a problem. ","The design of the interior is so roomy. You don't have a lot of room between the front seats, but except for that, it is more roomy and comfortable than almost any other car I have driven. I also have a Rav4 and this car is more comfortable.

The cup holders directly in front of the air vents is genius. Cold keeps cold in the summer.....coffee keeps warm in the winter. In between you can shut the vent off and it doesn't effect the cup. 

","Wow.....don't know about improvements. I would like some little creature comforts. Dual auto windows instead of just the drivers window would be nice. I would love to have the outside temperature show up on the display. Better radio options would be nice too.

I needed a car in a hurry and I was craving reliability after that car maintenance fiasco - so I went straight to Toyota. I've had the car for a year an a half and 18,000 miles. I love it. No problems at all, drove it from St. Louis to Galveston and back comfortably with 2 people and a dog on board. It has better acceleration, a smoother and quieter ride and overall better quality than any other small car that I've ever had - or been riding in for that matter. Also easy to get in and out of, even the back seat, even for my 6'4"" brother. I would recommend this car to anyone, 100 times over.","zippy acceleration, comfortable ride, amazing mileage (usually around 40 mpg), incredible price tag, low routine maintenance costs - I've learned to love the gauges in the middle of the dashboard - doesn't blind me when I drive at night.","My one and only complaint - that center console is in an awkward place. I have an automatic and rather short arms, and I still bump my elbow when I put it in gear. I pity the person who gets a manual and has long arms.

I sense that Toyota has slacked off on some of it's products, but I think the Yaris is worth the buy. ",Cup holders are cool. Just right for a commuter car. Fits easily into a parking spot. ,"Better seats would be a help- my back usually hurts from the cheap and lack of cushion. Reduction of engine noise and tire/front end noise would be a great help.

Getting about 400 miles per 11 gallon fill up from 50/50 city and highway driving. Very responsive handling and without bending my neck do not hit my head while getting behind the steering wheel. I'm 6'0 tall. Car seems much larger sitting inside than when looking in  from the outside. This is the first time I was able to get 2 vehicles inside my 2 car garage and with plenty of room to spare. The lift back door does not hit my garage door when both are fully opened and I can still stand up straight underneath the lift back fully opened with a couple inches to spare.,"The instrument panel ""cyclops"" central location is an excellent idea. I no longer have to look over or through the steering wheel to see the speedometer. There are 3 large compartments that open up on the dashboard. One is right in front of the steering wheel and  other two on the right side of dash.",The only thing  is a visible temperature and oil gauge instead of lights.

3.25,Too Americanized,viztor ,08/05/2009,,,4,3,4,4,,2,4,4,1,"Great car except for driving.  Poor handling, steering imprecise at highway speeds, shifting into 5th is clunky, visibility out of vehicle poor (thick door posts, headrests block lines of sight), bigger blind spot than my old car.  Our old 1978 or 1981 Civics would eat the Yaris alive and spit out the pieces.  Driving is now a chore, not an enjoyable experience.  No ash tray (good for storing insurance card, etc.), no external antenna (degrades  reception), speedometer needle hard to see when wearing sunglasses, have to check proper operation, but rear seat seat belts seem to be obstacles when the seat is down.     ",Air conditioning.  ,Give it good handling and lower the price.

My wife drives a Prius but we did not feel like spending 24,000 for another car.  We got the Yaris for 13,000 out the door and it has been great.  No problems at all. Fun to drive, first few tanks of gas has been averaging 36- 39 mpg.  Very fun to drive. ","Gas mileage is wonderful.  Not 50mpg, but, 40 for a third of the price.

So your arms get EXTREMELY tired in a very short time (And yes, I've checked the alignment SEVERAL times). I had a friend's 2000 Geo Metro Hatchback for a couple months last year, and that car tracked waaaayy better (and that's a $1000 car for crying out loud!!!!!!!).

3.875,"Well built, ""fun,"" economical car",harddrivin1le ,02/17/2009,,,3,4,4,5,,3,3,5,4,"I feel the greatest value in this car is found in the base models and that people who want more options would be better served with the Honda Fit.  That being said, I love my Yaris.  Mine has the dealer-installed TRD suspension parts (springs, shocks and rear sway bar).  The package utterly transforms the cars ride and handling and gives it a Mini-like feel.  The TRD package yields a very well balanced, fun to drive car and I'l highly recommend it to any enthusiast.  I also installed the leather wrapped TRD shift knob, which flexes less than the factory rubberized plastic knob and yields a more direct feel to the shifter.  Nice brakes, nice steering, acceptable seats, lots of storage, MPG!","Brakes are nice, optional TRD suspension parts are fantastic.  Acceleration with the 5 speed manual is surprisingly brisk.  The little car will pull past 110 MPH without much effort.  I love all of the interior storage spaces.","The stereo sounds bad; I replaced mine with a Pioneer and four Infinity Kappa speakers.  Seating could be better, but is fully acceptable in this price range."

5,A fun little car,Very Proud ,02/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We traded in our ford mustang for this car. We got the high end one with the McPherson suspension and manual transmission and so far we love it. Have had no problems, handles bad weather good and gets excellent gas mileage. The rear seat is surprisingly roomy for a sedan. Handling is fun to drive!! Will recommend to anyone. But only the manual transmission the automatic seems to stressed out.",Everything,More isolation from wind noise

4.875,Too Cute for Words,tempron ,02/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Having weathered the past 3 years in an expensive German car lease (including $4.75 unleaded premium), I am a good example of the change in trend of consumer behavior.   Bought my Yaris after a quick test drive and am in love with this cute little car.  I obviously wanted (and needed) a car that was both inexpensive to own and operate, but also stylishly quirky and fun to drive.  ","Styling, high MPG and build quality.",Keyless entry should be standard.

4.75,Excellent choice,Blaze ,02/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"I love this car, both inside and out. I am getting 35 mpg on average and I think this number will go up after the winter is over. This car has everything I need and is a great commuter vehicle. It is roomy inside, I had two snowboards and some other equipment in the back with the back seats folded down and another person on the passenger side, no problem at all.","Simple design, manual transmission, great fuel economy, versatility.","Heated mirrors and nav system. These features are offered in Canada on the same vehicle, why not in US."

5,The best car out there!,cad ,02/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was looking for a vehicle that was great on gas mileage, reliability and safety. After two + years of test driving and research, I settled on the Toyota Yaris 4 door lift back. I have no regrets over my choice. This car is fantastic! Lots of fun to drive and peppy to boot. It won't win any drag races, but the handling is fantastic. Tight turns, gets up to speed on the highway and is very stable even on windy days. Performed admirably in recent ice storm. I commute on a heavily trafficked highway with lots of construction vehicles and not once have I felt overwhelmed in this car. My gas mileage averages 38mpg with 70% highway, 30% city with conservative driving (no speeding).","Gas mileage, reliability, performance, lots of storage/trunk space, fold flat seats",

4.625,Only Small on the Outside,Sean Kecskes ,02/03/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,I've had my Yaris for six months now and I still love it. I get over 40 mpg on the highway and mid to high 30s in the city. It doesn't accelerate fast but that isn't what I wanted. This car the best you can get without going hybrid. I got it on a lease but if it lives up to Toyota standards I'll probably buy it out at the end.,"Gas economy, cargo space with the rear seats down, more leg room in the back than almost any VW.","More than just the one power outlet, and the one that is there is weird. Everything I plug into it feels loose."

4.875,The real smart car,Havana ,01/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a smart car to own. Relatively inexpensive to buy (unlike Prius), cheap to operate & maintain, and high resale value. Whenever I see the car from the outside, I think it's so small but inside, there's so much room for both front seat passengers. My wife didn't even want to look at one. After a test drive, she liked it more than the Fit or Versa. After 4 weeks and 1500 miles, I'm averaging 37 mpg, that includes some 80+mph freeway driving and steep mountain driving. The power is very adequate. The quality and resale are better than a Versa. The price was significantly lower than a Fit. The Korean makes are in this price range but aren't even in this league when it comes to resale. ","Unique, clean interior with lots of storage compartments, I like the gauge location and love the driver's side glove box, ABS and 6 air bags now standard on 2009 models",No tach? Every model should have a tach!!! The 5 door isn't available in the US with a manual transmission. This almost cost Toyota a sale. We loved the car so much that we compromised and bought the 3 door.

5,Finally got one with a cruise control,daf62757 ,01/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My daughter bought a 2007 Yaris and I fell in love with her car. I would have bought one much earlier, but they didn't come with a cruise control. Finally, the liftback came with a cruise control and I bought one. The ride is great. I drive from Indy to Chicago every week and have gotten 34 MPG in mixed driving. This is a fun car to drive and has a really smooth ride. It isn't a Lexus so you have some tradeoff, but overall, great value for the money and since it is a Toyota, I know it will last a long, long time!  ",Turning. It is so small it can turn around in very tight spaces. Large cabin for such a small car.,"Heated side power mirrors. It has power mirrors, but they aren't heated. Navigation and bluetooth would also be nice options. Finally, Toyota sells the Yaris in Europe with a digital speedometer and tach. That would have been a nice option and I would have paid more for it!"

5,09 Yaris review,Hoody ,01/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Picked this little thing up on a Sat night Dec 27th after testing it a couple days.  I found it to be fun to drive and has a peepy little 1.5, it did 70 on the interstate with no sweat.  I bought it mainly for the wife for a local run about, replacing the 92 Chrysler T&C which was getting to be a pain.  I like pretty much everything about it right now, it has all the stuff it needs.",the CD that plays MP3 and WMA standard. The 60/40 split fold down rear seats.,"A small higher console between the front seats, like on my 05 Corolla. Other than that its pretty complete for a small car.  The speedo should incl the tech on all models. and maybe the same outdoor temp gage. And the clock should be separated from the speedo, with date and time."

4.25,Amazing on icy roads,BIll McCabe ,01/08/2009,,,3,5,5,5,,5,3,5,3,"I've always driven big cars like caddys, Lincolns, and even a 24 Lincoln stretch. The vehicle I turned in off lease to buy my Yaris was a 2005 Saturn Vue with a 3.0 6cyl and all the bells and whistles. I bought a baseline 2009 Yaris and was skeptical as to how well it would handle the roads and weather where I live. Today we had ice everywhere. In weather like this my Vue was useless but the Yaris handle the ice and the hills like a plow I swear never slipped once or even felt like it was going to. I will recommend this car to anyone who will listen I still think its a shoebox but man what it handles like a half track in bad weather.","Handling, big inside, performance, and style. Mine is black in and out. I love the tight feel it has peppy little engine for a 1.5 4 banger. In all a hearty 2 thumbs up Toyota you made a believer out of a guy who only drove American!","Brighter interior lighting, inside light should stay on longer too. Move dash back where it belongs. "

3.625,2009 Toyota Yaris Sedan Manual,Jack Santos ,01/04/2009,,,3,3,3,5,,3,3,5,4,"If you are looking for a cheap, reliable car, the Toyota is the way to go. My family has been using Toyota for 20 years and never has had problems. The Yaris is no exception. The styling of the car catches glimpse even more than the Honda Fit and Nissan Versa. The center mounted climate control, radio, and odometers create a very nice V look. Not the fastest car out there, but one that will get you from A to B at a decent pace. Acceleration is slow however buyers are not looking for a fast car.",The car's driver seat can be set to a perfect position of comfort even with someone of my height of 6 foot 3 inches. Gas millage is excellent. A lot a trunk and interior room. Nice style with the S model.,Needs a better suspension because it shakes with every bump. Interior has a cheap look and feel. Better cup holders. The transmission has to soft of a feel and requires a lot of acceleration upon take off.

4.625,Great Little Car,Luke ,12/11/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,4,"In my opinion, people give out too many 10s these days, so I'm trying to make my review as realistic as possible. I've always driven a truck, but seeing the way the economy is and fluctuating gas prices, downsizing is the smart thing to do now. I don't have a lead foot, but I'm not always the most conservative driver and I'm getting 38 mpg doing about 30% city/70% highway. Looks great on the outside, the build quality is good. As far as reliability, I believe it was consumer reports that put it in its top 10 list of reliable cars at #7 so that's definitely a good thing. Overall, I'm happy with the car and recommend it to friends when they say ""Nice bubble, do you like it?""","Gas mileage. Reliability (so far). Look of the vehicle. Simple maintenance. Surprisingly roomy for a small car. Heating and A/C work great. MP3 jack. Daytime running lights. Power package is a must (spend the extra cash for it, you'll thank yourself later).","Centrally placed gauges are a bit awkward but not a deal breaker. Cup holder placement is a little awkward too. Seats were uncomfortable at first, now that I've got 3500 miles on it, they're much better. Center armrest should be standard. Rear bumper protector should be standard.  "

5,Great small car,hwbucky ,12/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We recently bought our Yaris and are very pleased with it. It is important to get the armrest as an accessory though. The fuel mileage is great so far. About 38 mpg. This car does not feel crowded on the inside though, but it fits nicely everywhere. If you are looking for a fuel efficient, economical car, this is a great choice.",Size and mpg. I really like the body style too. ,I would like it if it had cruise control.

5,Get your hands on a Toyota!,John ,11/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Friends thought I was crazy selling my '07 Civic Si, and perhaps I was.  Yet one month later I purchased the Yaris and don't miss the Si at all! Who needs 0-60 in 5.3 seconds?  The Yaris is an economical, quality, and well thought out car by the Japanese automaker. I like the aerodynamics of the car, not to mention all the nooks and crannies.  Fuel economy is on a par with the Prius, and the Prius costs about 10k more.  Frankly, I'll take the Yaris at 15k and 10k of free gas.      The hatchback is also fun to drive.  I am 6'3"" and have plenty of head and adequate legroom.  The convenience pkg upgrade is worth the price. ","styling, economy, vision out of windows",60/40 split rear seat on base model.

3.875,My new Yaris ,Pat ,11/07/2008,,,1,4,4,5,,5,3,5,4,I just bought a hatchback Yaris because it was a Toyota and I wanted a small car w/good mileage. I previously owned a VW beetle which I loved but it was getting too costly to own - so I went w/a Toyota mainly because of the reliability of the company. I owned Toyotas in the past and a Honda - I would've bought a Honda Fit but it was more expensive than the Yaris,"Size - I like small cars. Pick up - for a small car, it accels well",Cup holders that are usable! Putting the dash information like mileage reader in front of the driver instead of in the center - hard to read

5,YaY For Yaris!!!,yaris fan!!!! ,11/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've owned a Yaris for two years now, just upgraded to a 2009. I love it. There is so much space in the back seat, friends never complain, storage everywhere, I love the center console area , cup holders positioned perfectly. AMAZING  gas mileage. Low cost maint. Because the car is so light weight it takes off quick even when getting on the free way. So no complaints about power. For the price it's worth it. The value of the car held on great. It's a great Car. Compare it to other cars similar to it and it stands out in price, style, comfort, and reliability. ","The cool storage compartments. In one above the steering wheel I keep quick handy items like my cell phone, sunglasses, iPod. It's great. The center console  looks cool. It streams down like a waterfall. It catches a lot of attention. And of course the gas mileage. It does great on freeway.","This is saying a lot about how good this car is. The 2007 Yaris I owned had one complaint , it had no power locks or power windows. But that was my fault for trying to save money. For the new 2009 i got power everything and the only complaint here is the  orange center console light. "

5,Echo Lovers Come On Over,Carol ,10/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I owned a Toyota Echo, and drove it for 8 years with excellent satisfaction. I was hoping to drive it 8 more but was hit by another vehicle running a red light. Even so it handled beautifully and stayed upright. I searched to replace it and couldn't find another Echo. I looked for the closest thing..a 2009 Toyota Yaris. I love it. I recommend it. Gas mileage highway miles about 43 mpg. Plenty of pep and handles well. Try it, you'll like it:)",I always spilled pop on the cup holders in the center. Now they open and close and are hidden when not it use at the top dash area. I like that feature. Easier to clean. Good looks. Compact size maneuvers into parking spaces easily.,"Wider front span. Substantial, but I think the Echo was a tad larger in front."

5, Best Value Among It's Competetiors,Austin ,09/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After my research & comparison on Toyota Yaris & Honda fit, I decided to get Yaris because it wins in most category & fit my needs for daily use.   For two fill-ups, I got 41 MPG ( 40% city/ 60% highway) by driving it gently. It's amazing & almost as good as a Prius. The finish is excellent & the dashboard & charcoal fabric are nicer than others. The ride is smooth & relatively quiet. It accommodates 4 adults comfortably.  The  power & acceleration is outstanding for this small 1.5L engine.  There is nothing to dislike.The only thing I don't like is that the power door lock/keyless entry is not standard.
