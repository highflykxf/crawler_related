2,2009 Routan Nightmare!,Riri ,02/08/2016,1,2,3,,,1,1,2,4,,,"I was excited to buy my 1st VW, but sadly lost all trust in VW shortly after owning a Routan. The Routan is very unsafe to be on the road. Corporate doesn't stand behind their poorly made products, and this minivan has broke me due to constant major monthly repairs. Most repairs have involved the braking system (replaced master cylinder twice, abs unit & flushed brake line). Wheel barrings all needed replacement & problems with engine (censor replaced & another major part that I forget what it was now..I've lost track at this point). In the last 2 1/2 years it's required 11 major repairs that have cost me over $6,400! It's the most Ridiculous & UNSAFE vehicle I've ever owned! I can't wait to get out from owning a VW.",,

The Routan felt more comfortable, more powerful, my wife really likes the amenities that it has and how it handles.

I've seen cites comparing the Routan with Kia and honestly, they aren't even in the same league.  ","Leather is plush, seats comfy, the navigation/media center is awesome. Performance is also great, less than 9 seconds 0-60 in a minivan!

The interior leather looks cheap (thanks to the Chrysler design).  The kids constantly bump their heads on the DVD players when going in and out of the vehicle so keeping the screens closed helps!  Other than that, we have not taken it on a long trip, so I can't judge comfort or gas mileage fully.  It has 6k miles on it and I hope we are one of the lucky ones that does not incur any mechanical issues.  We love the sched. maint. We love the options i.e. remote start and heated rear seats, for the money it is a good deal.  I have owned 4 VW's so far.  Hope this one is built just as well.?!

We know its essentially a Chrysler, but the interior has enough VW feel to be fun.  The dual-electric doors are great (Toyota Siennas seemed to offer only one electric door on some models).  The exterior has strong lines.  Will have to follow up later with a detailed review of reliability.  Basically, its a minivan for those who promised they would never get one.

MPG doesn't really matter when you put as few miles on as we do!  Best handling/riding minivan I've driven!  Way roomier & more useful than the SUV we turned in.  Quality issues include sliders that don't open in temps below 30 degrees, a tire pressure monitor that is constantly on, and some rattles.  Over time I've noticed much more suspension noise.

Best of all, the ride comfort and quietness give me and my family a peace of mind, and I learned how very important it is to be able to carry a normal conversation on a long trip, which you cannot do if you're in other popular (for no real reason) minivans that produce wind/road noise.

I woke up one morning to the side of our new van wide open getting soaked in the pouring rain. The power windows are very sporadic. Sometimes they work, most times they dont.

I drove Honda Odyssey for 10 years and I loved it as well. But, it has that minivan feel which most of my friends used to joke about. Routan doesn't make you feel like you are driving a minivan. Also, the seating really helps towards that feel.  I was not looking to won Routan as I wanted to stay with Japanese maker as I never had any issues with my 2000 Odyssey on which I drove over 200K.

Rear ceiling height is a problem if you get the moon roof. The moon roof needs room to slide back, so you lose several inches of ceiling height.  This means that the rear seat TV is low enough to block the rear view mirror and that the rear seats can't tip forward because they hit the ceiling.

Only rated it an '8' on reliability as we had a 'no-start' situation this past Monday but this is the reason for the review -- VW's roadside assistance arranged a tow to the dealer who handled it quickly -- it turned out to be loose connections in the master fuse panel.

Needless to say I was very impressed with all the features you get with a SE model. It drives like a dream and my daughter loves watching movies on car rides to the grocery store. Don't buy a mini-van, buy a Routan.... :-)","Comfort, Style, and Ride.",TDI model please!

4.625,Pretty nice,vwfan ,11/17/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I'm not a mini van guy but we needed something that seats 7. If I was going to consider a mini van it would have to be a VW due to their style and class. I was very impressed with the overall design and style of the Routan. I love the captains chairs. They really give it a roomy but cozy feel. I recently found out that the Routan is pretty much a Chrysler with a few VW touches. I would still recommend a look and a test drive. It's still more hip than a Toyota, Honda, Chrysler ect.",Ride quality is nice and quiet. The brakes are quick and smooth. I really like the entertainment system.,"VW inspired gauges, larger sporty wheels 18"" or 19"". TDI?"

4.75,Awesome for what it is,cfeigenbutz ,10/22/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"There have been many complaints about this being a rebadged Chrysler.  For what it is, the Routan is outstanding.  There is no way to get a Wolfsburg designed and built minivan to the U.S. in this price range.  VW is trying to capture the market for their customers who already have a VW and need a family hauler.  We have a Jetta, and needed more room for our growing family.  While every aspect of it may not be ""German Engineered,"" it surely is ""German Inspired.""  The ride is great, the layout inside is well though out (we have a bench instead of the captain's chairs for the 2nd row, much more convenient in my opinion).  Would definitely recommend.  ","The ride.  For a van, it handles very well. Very quiet inside.  Handles bumps well.  Braking is amazing.  Easy to get little ones in and out of.  I don't feel as silly driving this as I would a Honda or Toyota.","Put the DSG transmission in, the Chrysler one is twitchy.  While VW did redesign the inside, I wish they went a little further.  (Add blue and red gauges).  Other than that, it is excellent."
