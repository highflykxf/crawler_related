I towed my car to Huntington Chevrolet because I was Only allowed 25 miles or so. They Charged me $750 to replace the Lock Cylinder and my remote start didn't work anymore. they said they didn't cover the remote start and Robert Chevrolet was responsible for that only if they put it in. in which they did. yet they still weren't responsible that Huntington was because they played with the ignition. that was last year. now my car is Locked Out and I can't start it once again. have no Idea how to start it. i'm probably going to have to tow it to a dealer so they can reset it. and figure out how to by pass the pass lock wich voids warrantee but I won't have to pay the dealer a couple hundred every year to reset the lock system. I get 14mpg. constantly carrying tools so its sluggish going up hill. electric mirrors, blue tooth and all my electronics either don't work or don't function properly all the time. and the AC only takes in outside air. so if I'm behind a school bus in the rain. and need the defroster on my car smells like diesel exhaust and I have a baby in the car and I have to go through a dirty wheel well to change the blinker from under the car. it because of this car that I HATE CHEVY.",,
1,STEER CLEAR OF THIS VEHICLE!,Chevy Junk! ,05/12/2016,1,1,2,,,1,2,2,1,,,"At first, I LOVED this car. Smooth ride, lots of room, pretty decent gas mileage. Four years later, all radio speakers, except the small one in the dash, stopped working, unless the outside temperature was at least 85 degrees. After calling Heritage Chevrolet in Chester, Va 3 times to get an appointment, I was told there was a short in the speakers. This affected the On-Star, back up alarm, and turn signal volumes. Heritage said to replace the radio, it would cost $750!!!! No radio is worth all that.  Maybe when the radio catches fire, Chevy will do something about it!  So I lived with no radio 9 months out of the year. Now, after the warranty expires by 8 months, but much less than 100,000 miles, a plate in the transmission breaks causing the car not to change gears. Repair costs....$4500!!!!! Again, Chevrolet will not help with the repair costs. Never again will I buy a Chevrolet product. Poorly made parts only last a few years. I have bought 2 cars from Heritage, one of which we paid cash for, but never again. They do not stand behind their product because they know it is JUNK! And adding insult to injury, my independent mechanic tells me that the power steering will need to be replaced very soon. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!!!!!!!",,

Our Traverse has been a vehicle that we brought to the dealership most because of recalls, back jobs, and now a shot transmission at just 117k (min $1,500, max 3k+ repair cost)?  Our other cars certainly did better!  I usually don't complain but we are not happy. I found out that this transmission problem is a common issue, I don't understand why it isn't a recall!

We bought this because Americans help Americans especially in GM's dark times.  But now we realized, who's going to help us now?  We don't have the budget for this now, so our Traverse is sitting in the garage.

If you insist in getting this, get an extended warranty.","It is huge.  Fits everything that a family of four + some more needs on outings and lots more for shopping.

Fuel economy.","Since middle seating spaces in 2nd row is narrow, the middle buckle is in the way of your bottom when you sit.  It will definitely hurt your bottom.

Needs improvement on reliability.  I brought this car to the dealership for different reasons such as interiors (carpet clips always breaking off), interior controls (drivers side window control stopped working but fixed and now the passenger side stopped working).  The steering squeaks, Chevy dealership never found the problem and now I am out of warranty, I am sure they wouldn't care.

Well, from the beginning I had problems with the car. I was experiencing a stalling type of drive. I would be driving along and all of a sudden the car would jerk and go extremely slow almost killing myself and my family. At times the vehicle would jerk and lose all power and shut off in the middle of the highway, street, anywhere! I have put so much money into this vehicle that I am embarrassed to say. I don't know what to do or who to contact because this is not a safe vehicle. Do Not, I repeat, Do Not purchase the 2009 Chevy Traverse EVER!",The inside of the vehicle is all that and more!

Barely, made it home alive and took it to the auto center.  They informed me they would not work on it because it would happen again and so when I tried to move it, it would not go in reverse.  
We have had problems with the power steering and 3 recalls on it.  Something is wrong with the 2009 version of this car.  My brother had the same problem and when we were at the repair shop the owner said his sister had the same problem.

Had higher miles in it for the year but that seldomly bothers me considering my driving needs.  Terrific car!  Have had to fix one thing since 2011 and that was a minor repair.  (Actuator ... Controls hot and cold air)  Haven't had to jump it, tow it, fix it, absolutely nothing!  No joke either!  Ridiculously happy with this car!  When I need my next, I'll buy another one, wouldn't think twice about it.  ","The drive is nice, no it's not a performance vehicle.   But if your buying a Traverse you're not using it as a high end performance vehicle either.  Dual temperature controls makes it comfortable for everyone in any seat.  Lots of room for people and things! Middle seats also move forward and back, so you can make adjustments if the very back seat is filled with people as well.  Had the car full of softball players to grown adults and it went great for all!  I coach ball during the summer so equipment and players are in and out all.the.time.  Buy all weather mats, much easier to clean with all those cleats. 
","Of course like any SUV mpg's are always the complaint.  Fuel economy.gov is right what I get.  I drive both highway and in town miles.  Combined I'm at that 17 mpg mark.  As usual, that's my only complaint.  I don't baby my cars, i drive them.  Just a very nice all around car, low maintenance, typical oil changes, cheap gas (doesn't need the pricey stuff), reliable.

I went back and this time they said that the window was out of alignment and they aligned and lubed it.

GM finally saw the light and has produced some fine vehicles that compare and surpass in ways the Japanese vehicles. The Traverse is one such vehicle. The smooth quiet ride, the agile handling, the options to please. It may not have an over 30 mpg, but it's a welcome gift for large guys like Myself. It surpasses the Honda Pilot and anyone looking for a roomy SUV/CUV should definitely test drive this vehicle! It also heralds some great safety ratings as well...and the AWD is great in winter conditions. Try it you'll love it! ","The Bose stereo is second to none.

My kids love the DVD and XM radio. Gas mileage blows. I think GM needs to be honest in that department. I've had this car for a month now and I can't seem to break 16 mpg no matter what I do.

Tire chains will not work on the Traverse which could pose quite a problem if you want to go skiing and you're not allowed to go up the mountain because the stupid vehicle was built so you can't use chains.

I would highly recommend the Traverse to anyone.  I have two complaints. It doesn't always know what gear it wants to be in and will sometimes have a bit of an acceleration lag when you have slowed down but then press the gas (like when the light changes from red to green). I will press the gas, then press the gas some more until it figures out what gear needs to be in and will then accelerate excessively. The other complaint is that it is surprisingly large and takes some getting use to.",The ride an build quality. The Traverse feels very solid.

I see a lot of posts about poor mileage but we have consistently got 20 to 22 mpg in mixed suburban driving which in my estimation is great for such a large car. My only regret is that I did not buy an LT2 or LTZ package to get some of he features like backup camera, power folding mirrors, temperature controlled climate controls, and upgraded radio.

2,"Traverse, sorry we bought it",Linda Silvey ,09/14/2009,,,1,1,3,3,,3,2,1,2,We bought our traverse in June2009.  The headrests are very uncomfortable and force a short person to keep their head bowed if they don't put a pillow behind their back.  My husband has nearly wrecked it three times when trying to make a left hand turn due to the poor visibility when looking to the right to see if another vehicle is coming.  It is hard to park because you cannot see the front end and it's very hard to back up due to the small window and the many blind spots along the sides (we have the economy model). The gas mileage is awful.  We took a long trip and the highway mpg never got above 18 mpg. My biggest concern is safety.  It is an accident waiting to happen.,The color,Headrests need to be able to be removed or turned backwards.  Backup camera needs to standard on all models.  Something needs to be changed to improve the gas mileage.  My old beat up van gets 22 in town.  The frame support between the windshield and the front doors causes lg dangerous blind spot.

My combined mpg has been 17.4mpg with roughly 50-50 city/highway mix.  This is AFTER driving like I am 80 years old.  I have never owned a vehicle so far below EPA mileage estimates.

The seats fold and move very easily to make more space for hauling when necessary.  The back- up sensors and camera are great.  My biggest complaint is the size of the buttons for turning A/C on or off, front or rear defrost on/off, etc.  There's a cluster of 8 buttons and if you don't know just where the button is you're going for, it's a bit confusing and takes your attention from the road for a moment.

We purchased a loaded 2LT and the ride quality is outstanding. The cabin is incredibly quiet, even with the sunroof opened. Our other vehicle is a 2007 PT Cruiser and the Traverse is doing nearly the same gas mileage of that small car! We're averaging 18.6 MPG with a heavy amount of in-town driving. When calculating the mileage with all the horsepower the Traverse has, I can see that if you are quick to take off at a green light, you can easily lower your MPG greatly. For the size of the vehicle, the fuel economy is good.

4,A few concerns,DParler ,08/23/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,3,4,"I bought this SUV over a Toyota Highlander because I could negotiate a better price & I had $3500 worth of GM card points to further reduce the price.  I also favored this vehicle over the Highlander because (1) it seats 8, not 7; (2) it has greater cargo room, ESPECIALLY when the rear seat is up; and (3) the seats split 60/40 so that one can go on vacation, comfortably seat 5, & still have room for luggage. As an owner, I have my concerns & disappointments.  One of them is MPG consistently around 15.5 mpg.  My wife's Sienna van gets 20 mpg under same conditions.  You need to evaluate for yourself these ""awkward features"" ( 1) headrests; (2)seat comfort & adjust ability; (3) rear visibility.",Split-row seats; easy access to third row; adequate cargo space in rear with third row seat up.  On-Star is really cool and XM radio rocks ... but remember you are buying a vehicle and those are services taht require continual (paid) subscriptions.,"They REALLY do need to work on those headrests.

The 2nd row (bench seating) can be moved forward and back, we thought this was great until we realized the the track it runs on creates a little crevice on the floor.  We've lost kids DS games in there not to mention the ""stuff"" that is getting stuck in there. Also when moving the seat to get to third row, it crushes the mat on the floor, it does not accommodate for that - bad design.  The car drives great on the highway but does not shift down very smoothly making city driving a little jerky.  We almost bought the Ford Flex and are having buyer's remorse. Traverse still kinda looks like our old van on the outside.","Back up camera!  LOVE it!  Also has lots of good front storage! Very quiet on highway. Plus love the ""toys"" - XM radio, GPS, DVD player - but you can get this on any car.",Change front headrest! Gives me back pain that I've never had before. Also re-think the sliding bench seat - that crevice - not good.  Plus getting into 3rd seat shouldn't ruin your car mat.  It's like you forgot that that seat was going to move.

We bought this because it was very similar to our Cadillac SRX which was also fully loaded (and it actually has a real 3rd row!). We did some research and found that the safety rating was perfect and the airbag system was top of the line. We wanted this to be our family vehicle. However, within two weeks of our purchase we made a cross country trip to Chicago for a family members funeral (I don't fly and always drive.) That's when I first notice our ""CHECK AIRBAG SYSTEM"" warning light came on. Well, to make a long story short.

I feel every bump in the road.  The headrest on the seats points forward such that I hit my head on it with every bump.  There is no way to adjust it or the seat to stop this from happening.

Quiet on the road and you can't tell that the engine is running sometimes unless you check the tach.  Wife tried to start it several times while it was running...no problem it locks out the starter. Very good power although apparently the transmission has been optimized for mileage (at 60 mph it's running at only 1600 RPM) so it's slightly sluggish until it downshifts out of 6th gear. The mileage is MUCH better than I expected getting 21-22 mpg in suburban driving and the advertised 24 mpg on the highway. That seems remarkable for such a big car.

Gas mileage is 22 on Highway...1 trip to Florida and back...very comfortable.  Only one problem...have a burning smell that cannot be located.  Seems to be intermittent and 2 dealerships have looked.  People stop me all the time to comment on what a great looking vehicle it is.  So far, best car I have ever had including 2 Cadillacs.","The seating...so comfortable with lots of leg room both front and rear.

So we needed room, my husband Mark was against a mini van and the gas mileages on most suvs are not  good. We look at different vehicles for about a month off an on, mostly imports  because of their reliabilities. Test drove the Honda Pilot and was about to buy when we saw the Traverse drive by. Read reviews,& went to dealer. Fell in love, At first we were going to buy one with the ench seat in the 2nd because of having 3 kids. Decided on capt's chairs. The kids all have plenty of room and fight over the the 3rd row because they sit in middle & stretch they leg between the capt's chairs.","Very roomy, handles more like a car then a suv or mini van. Navigation with traffic updates have been right on so far. My favorite is the power 281 hp and we still get over 20 mpg. Most suvs that get that good of mpg are 250 hp or less.  ",DVD Player screen to small does not look right. A vehicle this size should have a screen bigger then it is. Also would like to have a rear window that opens and I mean down into the door not like a hatch back.
4.25,Great car with a few problems,Chevyforlife ,05/12/2009,,,4,5,3,5,,5,4,4,4,"Have owned car for 3 months, very stylish outside.  Have LT1 version, interior seats are very nice though a bit uncomfortable especially for your lower back.  No carpet in the back seats, basically a big floor mat latched down.  I get 20.2 MPG.  My biggest problem with the car is the location of the oil filter.  I have changed oil on dozens of vehicles (new and old) but never had to change the filter from the top of the engine.  There is not enough room to place a filter wrench on the filter, it took 3 hrs for 3 men to unloose the initial high torqued filter by hand.  When the filter was loosened it went all over other components located underneath the filter.  Otherwise a great car and roomy.","Very roomy inside, stylish outside","Please fix the oil filter problem, I have always changed my oil if I would have looked at the location of the filter before buying I would have passed on the vehicle.  Whether you do it yourself or take it somewhere, oil will go all over the engine causing burning oil smell & eventually damage"

This is a solid built vehicle with a smooth and strong engine.  It provides good acceleration from a standstill or passing on a highway.  It has a great amount of cargo space and it very easy to fold down the 2nd and 3rd row seats.  The interior design is very refined with clean lines and symmetry. The feel and quality of the plastics and leather seem of higher quality than previous Chevys.

They were good, but if you're in the need of large-ish SUV, take a Traverse for a test drive, I was sold. It's very comfortable, quiet and nimble for it's size. High-end powertrain and engineering all around. Great for larger families and if you rate safety high on the list.","Interior and exterior look great. Comfortable seats, in a GM!

But, our first baby is due in September and we needed a family car.  So we went off and test numerous SUVs; Honda Pilot, Acura MDX, Infinity FX35, Mazda CX-9 and Nissan Murano.  All most of them had the same options and features, but somehow the Chevy Traverse stood out from all of them.  First, the design was eye catching (Generally I don't like the look of Chevy cars) sexy and aggressive at the same time; Second, the features where all comparable or even better than the other top-end models of the other manufactures I mention above. Finally, the price and interest rate from Chevy BEAT all competitors. GO USA!!","All the controls were easy to use, especially the touch screen enter/Nav System.

We tested, Hyundai Veracruz, Kia Sorento and Borrego, and GMC Acadia. Chose Traverse over Acadia due to looks, price, and Edmunds reviews.

So far, it's been everything that I've expected, and I expected great things.   There is plenty of room for my family of four (2 yr old and 7 mo old).  Sliding the 2nd row seats back as far as they go gives a ton of room to get the kids in and out of their car seats.  The cargo room behind the 3rd row fits our ginormous double stroller with no issues.  I get 22-24 MPG on the hwy and 19 overall.  Not bad, but I feel it could be better.  The roof rack cross rails whistle terribly above 50MPH (I've removed them since).

We are extremely happy with the vehicle, but last night while driving in the interstate one of the tires split in half while going 70 miles per hour. We are extremely concern with the quality of the factory tires in this vehicle.The tire was melting as I was exchanging it. To replace a tire is one of the most challenging task you will perform. The tools included are not the best for the job. Our main concern is the safety of our family and we are not sure with the tires on the vehicle.

We looked at many vehicles and this was a great selection for safety and gas mileage.  The vehicle is really comfortable and my children love the space and comfort while traveling.  We were reluctant to get a minivan so this seemed to be the perfect fit because it looked sleek yet had many nice ""minivan"" qualities.

She didn't like the style of Honda and Toyota. The Buick did not have a strong feel to it on the road. The Acadia was her favorite but I kept after her about the fluky transmission leaving her somewhere. The Mazda was my favorite by feel and tranny.

We've been very happy so far with this car.  My 4 year old son throws a fit if we have to take our other car (a Pontiac Torrent) somewhere.  I love the bluetooth phone technology and the AWD handles great in the snow.  I highly recommend this vehicle for anybody who drives a lot with a car load of people. ,"Bluetooth, auto start, backup camera, rear seat entertainment with wireless headsets.",There should be a shutter or something hiding the backup camera from the weather elements as you have to wipe off snow/dirt often.

The car drives and handles much better than the escape it replaced. The gas mileage is acceptable for a vehicle of this size although not much better than a Tahoe. Power is adequate even in mountain driving. The transmission is very smooth shifting. I find that is isn't slow to down shift at all but very quick to up shift.I assume that is to improve the mileage. So far we are averaging 19mpg in combined driving.

I laid on my horn and steered left as the car that pulled out still was crossing left with no signal. I slammed on my breaks thinking that I should have gotten gap protection when the entire car locked up and stopped me from smashing into this guys rear end.

The Traverse is not only comfortable for me but offers incredible passenger room and storage capacity. Lots of great/thoughtful design choices in the cabin. Front seats are the most comfortable in the crossover class by a mile. I've been impressed by how well the A/C system heats/cools the large space, as well as how good the Bose speakers sound. The drive is superb: quiet, powerful, smooth. This should be high on the list for anyone in the SUV/crossover/minivan market. It's been years since I've had a GM, but the Traverse might well have brought me back for good.","The ample safety features and thoughtfulness of the interior design are great. There are cupholders and places to store things everywhere you turn. Exterior styling is also nice. Back-up camera is very useful, as is the rear sonar system. Bose speakers work as advertised -- essential upgrade!","Would like to see a little better mileage, but it's not easy to propel a 5000 lb vehicle down the road.

As far as just driving it for my wife and I, we love it. However if you have kids and use the seating, not so much. The way the seats fold to get to the third row is not a smooth procedure. The seats ride on tracks that you have to kneel on to lift your child into the back seat. Very uncomfortable on your knees. Also toys, and small things get dropped into the tracks, effecting the operation of the seats. When you try to dig them out, you get grease on your fingers. If the rear window opened up (like the TrailBlazer does) loading would be easier. when you open the hatch, everything falls out.","We do like the OnStar, the rear camera, sound system, dashboard features, and glove compartment space","Apparently the engineers don't have kids, or have to get groceries.

I had 3 in the past and new I loved them. The dealer had the Traverse LTZ on the show room floor.  I test drove it & was so relieved to have that Solid, Chevy SUV feeling back. Test drove the Tahoe & decided I loved the Traverse LT2 in silver! Love it! Get one!","Black leather seats, DVD/entertainment system, the rearview camera, the space, the smooth ride, the solid feel, heated seats, turn by turn directions, ease of use. Value for the price (fully loaded Chevy vs. stripped down Benz)",None that I can think of yet! 
5,Great family car,mjm ,12/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"4th in a long line of SUVs (Ford, Honda, BMW, Chevy). This SUV looks the best and has the strength the others do not (towing). Very comfortable driving position, plenty of room for a family of 6 and everything needed for long vacations. AWD has performed as expected in inclement weather (ice, snow). The qualtiy of this vehicle seems to be better than the previous Chevy I have owned.   ","Backup cameras, sensors. Driver's side leg room, driving position. Remote start. Smooth ride. Audio system is intense. Exterior styling","Hill holder feature to stablize vehicle in hill conditions, larger DVD screen."
4.75,Is this really a Chevy?,chevy guy ,12/15/2008,,,4,5,5,4,,5,5,5,5,"If you took the bowties off this SUV you would not believe it is a Chevy. My wife and I are very impressed. It was a leap of faith to order one without actually seeing one like it and driving it.  We are not disappointed.  Maybe I am too much of a Chevy man with some bias, but this is one great vehicle to drive and ride in with excellent build quality. We got the LTZ in Black Raven (I think that is what it's called) and it has some metallic it in.  Beautiful especially in the sun. ","Drive ride and build quality. Lot of room with plenty of cup holders. Love the sliding center console arm rest and storage area. The top of the dash has a nice storage area, too. The inverter is a very nice feature with the 115V outlet in the rear of the console.","Not sure about the bold 2-tone interior color options. If you get certain exterior colors (ie, black) the color mated with either the cashmiere or grey is dark black. We got cashmiere & it's a little bold for us but getting used to it. Whish they had more color combo options. "
5,Great Vehicle,ChevyTrav ,12/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Can't find too much to complain about yet with this car. It's roomy and rides well. A lot of nice features come with it standard (i.e. XM radio, OnStar, built in phone). Gas mileage has been as advertised so far. I guess there are two things that are slightly bothersome about it and both have already been mentioned by the editors. It tends to be a bit slow to downshift and there is a fair amount of plastic in the car. However, these two minor imperfections really haven't bothered me that much. Overall, I feel that this is a quality car that Chevrolet has put out. I would recommend this car to the person who needs space, towing capacity, and decent gas mileage to go along with it.","Split seating. This is a wonderful feature! I also like the quiet, smooth ride.","The air ""recycle"" button for the air conditioning and heating will only recycle the air when the knob is set to send air through the panels (or panel and floor).  I want it to recycle the air even when I have it on defrost so that I don't have to smell other people's exhaust!"
4.875,Great SUV,Ken Miller ,12/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The Traverse handles much better than the other GM ""clones"" and the new direct injection engine revs so quick and willingly.  Mileage is running 19/20 overall except when my son drives it and then it drops 2 mpg. Traded in a 2008 Mazda CX-9 and this is a far better vehicle. ",Engine provides quick power for merging.,Give us a 288 HP model in the LT series.
5,New Owner,Steve ,12/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We just purchased our Traverse last month. I drove it over 800 miles during the Thanksgiving weekend. So far, we love it!  Smooth, quiet, roomy, and with the leather and LT2 package, luxurious. Kids are comfortable in all seats (16 year old son is almost 6 foot). Ride quality is tight and free of any shakes or rattles. Great time to buy with GM adding bonus money  I would definitely recommend one to family or friends.","Smoothness of the ride, bluetooth phone feature, turn by turn nav system is simple to use and outstanding.  Engine/transmission combo operate very well. Great looks. I could go on but you get the idea. I'm very happy with it.",Nothing has come up. A great package.
4.875,Great people mover!,Patrick ,11/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a nice all around crossover. For people that love an SUV it delivers. For people that love a mini van it has the qualities without the looks. The styling of the interior is well put together and I love the easy use push buttons for the climate and audio controls. The best part is the way it drives! Fun, fun, and more fun. GM seems to have put a lot of thought and quality into this vehicle and I just hope that it performs like this for many years to come.","The way it drives, the quiet ride, leather seat styling, 10 speaker Bose audio system with the XM radio, auto start and alarm system, rear audio controls for the kids. ",None that I can think of.
5,Amazing SUV!,Narg ,11/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This SUV is an eye opener for what it delivers to it's driver. I've purchased driven a number of GM products over the past 18 years, and love how the quality and features that GM provides has grown continueally during that time. Yes, they used to be bad 20 years ago. But today, wow! Do not miss out on trying a Traverse before you buy anything. Even the dealership experience was the best I've ever had too. I'm moving from a full size pickup to this mid-sized SUV. Originally planned to buy a Tahoe, but the economy has downsized my buying ability slightly. Thank goodness GM made this SUV, it fits perfectly!","The ride must not be missed, it is excellent. The nav system is very nice and quick to respond to controls. Room inside the Trav is actually bigger than a Tahoe! The remote auto-start has a nice feature with also auto-adjusting air/heat/seat heat/defroster depending on outside temp. Wow!","I tried hard, but really can't think of anything. I did notice one very slight misallignment on dash parts, so what. And, I'd like to see a small increase in the rear DVD screen size. Overall though, this vehicle is amazing."
5,Fabulous Crossover,tunxton ,11/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I downsized from my Tahoe. I can confidently say this vehicle is the best I have ever owned. I do a lot of traveling for my company and the room in this vehicle accomodates for my stuff very easily. It is also extremely comfortable on those long road trips. I would definently reccomend this to anyone in the crossover market.,"Bluetooth, 2nd and 3rd row folding seats, air conditiond seats.","Nothing, keep up the good work Chevy."
5,My New Car - Love it,Sherri  ,10/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This car is quiet and fun to drive. I love the DVD system with the wireless headphones for the kids. The interior space is not much smaller than my Ford Expedition that I traded in. I actually have more cargo room while all 7 seats are up than before. ,"2 toned interior, moon roof, and sky scape",Not any that I can think of at the moment.
