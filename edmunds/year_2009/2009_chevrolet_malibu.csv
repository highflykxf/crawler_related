4,Chevy making cars that appeal to people,Andrew ,03/26/2016,5,3,4,,,5,4,3,4,,,"One time in my teens I has to drive my Grandpas old 1997 Lumina for a year. I hated everything about it.  It sucked gas, it turned like a bus, it had a giant V-6 with no power, it was ugly it, it was dated, the bench seats were terrible. The interior was from a bygone decade where you essentially had a couch in front of a slab of gray plastic with other black plastic bits stuck in haphazardly with no  What I haven't told you is this was Grandpas brand new 1997 Lumina in 1997. I was a German car fanatic and I used to make jokes well at least a VW is not an American car.  Anyway we went to Vegas and we were given a rental car 2012 chevy malibu, I fought tooth and nail to not get a Chevy. Give me a Toyota, Nissan, anything but a Chevy.  But the lady said it was spring break and the Malibu was a mid-size and I was waiting in line at 12:30 AM so I reluctantly took it. I went out to go get it and when I first saw it I though not too bad looking of a car.  And then I opened it up and the interior design was so thoughtful it shocked me.  There was an actual flowing design that was multicolored with accents and nice lighting.  I was very surprised by every aspect of the car.  My wife liked it and how it drove.  in 2013 my wifes X5 finally became too expensive to repair.  So we looked at Malibus and I found a 2009 LS  with 80k miles and they only wanted $9k.  Fast forward 3 years the car goes in for maintenance 3 times a year and we generally do whatever Chevy recommends. Last year was about $800 dollars in repairs. Leaking transmission pan/transmission service tie rods and a tune up.  The car has never failed us and has never needed a major repair.  $1500 dollars in year in total maintenance is awesome.  I used to pay $1500-$2000 year to service our 2 BMWs.  I have actually thought of getting rid of my M3 and buying a Camaro SS or Vette just because of how reliable our Malibu has been.   Were looking at getting my wife a 2016 Mailibu when our Malibu hits 200k miles roughly 2 years from now. Cons: Visibility is hard at 45* looking diagonal out the front because the A pillar and mirror are so large, the visibility out the back is also poor.  The trunk opening is small, and most large things need to go in the back seat. The whole front end has to come apart to change the light bulb but it's nothing a harbor freight socket set, some cold beer and a lazy Saturday can't  fix.  Chevy fixed these issues in later Malibus",,

It was great for the first month but afterwards it started to give me nothing but problems. The headlights continuously to go out which is a major issue seeming that the person that designed the car thought it was okay to make it to where you have to take the whole bumper off just to change a light bulb!!!!!! The brake lights also go out but thank god that's an easy fix and you don't have to pay over 100$ just to get it changed as you have to do with the headlights. The radio system sucks all my aux cords and devices do not work plugged in. My back doors do not unlock when pressing the unlock button. The tire pressure light is always on no matter what. The traction in the car sucks. I have took my car to the dealership over 3 times because in the front drivers seat every time it rains it gets wet. The cup holders are placed in a odd way to where there is not enough room for 2 cups. The turning signals do no turn off automatically when turning ever. This car sucks!!!!!!!!!!

Now at 140K miles I haven't had a real issue. The car was and is well kept with the oil change,breaks. Only thing is that the accelerator is kinda slow to pick up to a high speed. Changing the car light is a pain in the butt. Chevy was charging me 150.00 to change one light bulb because they had to remove the whole bumper. Lucky we know a guy who knows a guy that had a shop. We ended up paying 50.00 to change 2 light bulbs which isn't bad at all.Love Chevy.We have a Malibu and want a Silverado !!!",,

Keep in mind I""m a neat freak who washes his car daily, doesn't smoke, and cleans the inside weekly.  It's a 4 cyl, 6 speed auto, LT2.The Traction Contol Module / ABS module has been replaced 6 times!  Yes, it's been recalled now, but has been replaced twice since then, too.The transmission completely failed (wouldn't shift out of 1st gear) at 94,000 miles.  New one installed under warranty occasionally slips, too.Both brake lights have been replaced.  This is an easy fix.Both headlights went out the same day.  This does require removing the front bumper as indicated elsewhere on here.  Cost was $200 per the pair.The radio occasionally stops working.Bluetooth capability hasn't worked since the most recent reprogram by the dealer.The rear door locks must be manually activated on one side (passenger).The key fob failed at 8, 000, 15, 000, 22,000 miles, then the transmitter unit on the car itself failed at 60,000 miles and hasn't worked since. Now the car can only be unlocked manually on the driver door.The leather on the shift handle began wearing off at 100,000 miles.  The leather on the driver seat began wrinkling at 90,000 miles and has completely torn since then.The turnsignals won't shut off automatically after making a turn ... sometimes.  Sometimes they do, sometimes they dont.The power steering sometimes fails for a few minutes, then begin working again.The engine, however, has worked very well.

Recall after recall for some odd reason does not apply to my car and I've spent well over $1000 to replace steering column, power steering, stability control, traction control module.  The biggest joke on these cars is replacing the front headlights because you have to take off the front end to get to the headlights to replace the bulbs.  I was determined to not take it to the dealer so my son and I found a YouTube Video and 1 hr later had one replaced.  This is ridicules because on my Honda and Acura it takes me all of 3 minute tops!!!  My stereo also quit working so I ordered one for a reasonable price on E-Bay but as you might imagine it's not just a swap.  No that would be way too convenient.  You have to schedule an appointment with the dealer to have it programmed which is around $45 labor charge.  The Malibu is a great looking car and has good styling and features BUT Chevrolet and their engineers should be embarrassed they have produced such a mechanical FAILURE!!  Chevrolet should recall every Malibu manufactured from 2009-2012 and admit the created a ""LEMON""!",,

At first, I was in love with this car. However, after 9 months, that satisfaction has turned to disappointment. ","Dont get me wrong, there are many positives to the car. For starters, the car looks fantastic. The leather/suede seats are quite comfortable and the controls are easy to use. The quality of interior materials is nice as well. Thats where the positives end, unfortunately. ","My biggest frustration is probably the trunk. The opening is extremely small. I bought a new printer and the box wouldnt fit. I also couldnt fit my suitcase in it. Plus, the trunk floor is so weak that it sags down into the spare tire.

The performance is disappointing. Granted, I came from a V6 201HP to this I4 169HP, but this car is very sluggish. Its adequate, but doesnt hold a candle to my 04 and 06 models.

The stereo isnt anything to brag about either. Its clear, but lacks any umph. Also, a minor nuisance is the controls for the heated seats digs into my left leg. Lastly, there are many blind spots, especially in the rear."

Visibility is also poor to the rear. For me the visibility issue is the worst feature of the car. Four   items have been replaced on warranty: right rear door window gasket, the steering column, power steering rack, and the intermediate steering shaft. The piece above the mirror that holds the sun roof and garage door controls had to be reattached.

I like the quiet ride and overall feel of the car. With 9,500 miles on the car there are absolutely no problems.  Fuel economy is better than the EPA rated.  I live in a rural area & my city driving has very few stops.  I keep an Excel spreadsheet for fuel economy and the calculated economy is even better than the readings on the dash.  The lifetime fuel economy so far is 30.4 mpg overall. The 2.4 engine is quiet and reasonable for acceleration (not a hot rod).

The back seat fits our Britex carseat very well with plenty of leg room for our son. I like the controls easy to reach. The radio has 6 memories with 6 stations each which can be changed on the steering wheel. The remote start is great and easy to use with locking the keypad twice (turns on the alarm) & then pushing the remote start. The back seats fold down. We got a cargo net & mat package. The nets are great to keep items from rolling around. The driver seat has power seating.I was worried about the pick up and go and it does have this. Great rebates for 2009 models.

We bought this Malibu with all of the options available including even the extra cost Red Jewel Tint paint that has a nice subdued gold metal flake built into the paint color.  This is one very classy and upscale looking car especially with the two tone (mocha w/cashmere)leather interior.  The car has gotten many compliments especially once people have ridden in it.  It is very quick for a family sedan and the V6 seems to always be loafing unless pushed. ,"OnStar, 110V rear seat port, feeling of very solid build and especially with doors that close with that distinctive bank vault sound.

The 4 speed is adequate but I think the 6 speed might be peppier. Carefully check your fit and finish. I've discovered that my passenger door isn't properly aligned and that my folding rear seats don't latch properly. All in all it's a pretty smooth riding car and adequate for the usual day to day driving. I wouldn't want to take it on an extended journey though. Maybe the LTX model is more comfy?,"There's really nothing that jumps out on this car. It does have smooth body lines though. If you price Nissan Altima, or a Toyota you will probably buy the Chevy I got my 2009 for $19750 out the door. They wanted 34k for the Altima!

Actually, my previous car had 200 horsepower and this is 252. I owned 1997 and 2004 Monte Carlo's and put 100,000 on each without requiring repairs prior to turning them in. Chevy certainly did their homework with this car! It's first rate! My father owns a DTS and always buys Cadillacs, but he thinks this car is fantastic as well.

Excellent ride quality, handling, steering feedback, and braking. Love the satellite, OnStar, Bluetooth hands free phone, leather-wrapped steering wheel. Base stereo is very good. Ride is moderately firm and comfortable, but corners well with acceptable lean. ","Squishy factory Goodyear Eagle LS2 tires are quiet, but very poor performers that contribute to a choppy/jiggly highway ride. The vinyl seat trim has a greasy feel and could be more leather-like.

There wasn't anything special about the Camry and the Mazda 6 didn't handle very well so it eventually came down to the last three and overall I preferred the Malibu over the others.

From my perspective, the one thing I can't live with is the front entry and egress. The stylists clearly won the battle here. Exiting the car makes me feel like I'm in an Italian sports car.

It's a real feat of American auto engineering.  Just take all the controversy surround the GM company away and think of the vehicle as a piece of machinery.  The design is outstanding, both external, and internal. The fit and finish is at par with many Japanese manufacturers.  The cabin is accommodating and the drive is comfy and noise-free. The six-speed auto transmission is a marvel of engineering. In fact, GM went ahead and beat Toyota to it. Toyota followed with its own 6- speed soon after though.","Fuel economy, drives on regular, silky-smooth 6- speed auto, very comfy and hush-hush quiet. Lovely American engineering.

A full tank of gas lasted me SEVEN DAYS, and when I went to fill it up, I still had a quarter of a tank to go.  That's just awesome. Now, the bad.  First of all, who's idea was it to put such a tiny armrest in the vehicle?!?  I am short, so I have to pull the seat up.  I managed to be able to rest the very tip of my elbow on the darned thing, and had to rest my hand on the floor shift.  Floor shift not necessary if vehicle is automatic.  Suspension needs work, could HEAR and feel every bump hit while driving.","Great stereo, A/C, easy to use controls, EXCELLENT fuel economy, attractive interior and exterior design.  Very FAST!","Eliminate floor shift altogether, or make optional.  Enlarge armrest.  Entire body of car can be felt and heard shaking and rattling when driving over bumps or potholes.

So far, they have ""repaired"" the following items.  - fuel pump controller - engine computer - sun roof - driver-side power window - electronic compass  I emphasize ""repair"" because although a number of parts have been replaced, the dealer has no idea why so many things are going bad all at once.  Obviously in terms of a root cause, nothing has been repaired.

They can't explain why the computer went dead, why the sunroof and windows are blowing fuzes, etc.  With each new malfunction they assure me that the car is now fine.  Right...  The message from GM is that all these problems are unrelated and there is no single underlying root cause.  Right...  At this point it is plain that my brand- new 2009 Malibu LTZ is defective and unreliable.  I will never buy another GM product",Good-looking car.,My car is obviously a lemon.

When we took the Accord for a test drive you could instantly tell the improvement in the ride of the Malibu over the Accord.  Accord was noisier at acceleration and the wind noise around the mirrors was horrible!  She also stated that the Honda seats always felt like she was on a hard park bench but the Malibu felt comfortable.","Mom loved the comfort, quite ride, and smooth handling of the car at highway speeds.

This is something the Honda does not offer as well. The competitors do offer 18 gallon tanks and perhaps a bit better MPG but not enough to trade the pros of this car in for.

5,Great car,silverbullet ,02/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Checked out the Saturn Aura as well. I worked for Saturn for a year and had driven the 08 Aura very often, great car I knew it would be my next.  Once 0% was offered almost across the board for GM it was down to the Aura XR 4cyl vs. the Malibu LT2. The one thing I can say from my experience driving this car is if you are looking into 4cyl the 6 speed is a must. The original 2008 4 cyl 4 speed was loud!  Pitted local Saturn dealership vs. Chevy dealership and went with who had the better bottom line out the door pricing. I will admit I liked the subtle differences of the Malibu interior, especially the suede leather and leather around the shifter to make clean up easier.","Sunroof air guard is great hardly any wind when sunroof fully open on highway. Ambient lighting is nice touch, but hope you like blue.  Absolutely great ride smooth and silent.  Trunk is huge!  Bluetooth in 09 models make OnStar phone minutes obsolete. ","Poor rear visibility, large rear pillar and high seat backs.  Mildly awkward getting out of car but maybe that's how I sit?  I will definitely go with cargo net/trunk mat aftermarket package the $185 sticker price for this option can be beaten, yet because of large trunk this may be a necessity."

The 4 banger is more than adequate to get me down the road.  The 6 speed was a really ..REALLY needed addition to the 09 line-up.

5,First Chevy since 1954,Kansas City ,01/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Decided on the 2009 Malibu after looking at Camry, Accord, and Hyundai Genesis. This is the first Chevrolet we've owned since a 1954 Bel-Aire purchased in 1964. We've owned a Buick, Mercury, BMW, Acura, and several Ford trucks. This car was a replacement for a 2000 Chrysler 300M.  My wife was skeptical about the 4 cyl. after driving the 300M for 8 years.  She drove the 4 cyl. for a day and was impressed. I had voted for the fuel economy from the beginning. We are very satisfied with the car.  We drive a car for 8-10 years primarily for local trips and put about 8k per year on it. However, with the price of gas decreasing---the 6 cyl. was tempting. ",Interior design. Quietness after driving a very noisy Chrysler 300M-- road noise was awful. The 6-speed automatic is great and the 18 inch wheels were a pleasant surprise when shopping for a car. About 2000 rpms at 65 mph. This is our first time for an XM radio and we are sold on it.,Manual shift paddles seem funny on a 4-cyl.  I used the manual shift option on the 300M which was fun at times.

I've had a lot of cars but nothing this good for the money. I had no intention of getting a Malibu until I test drove it (I was set to buy a Camry.)  The Chevy won in ride and performance, and interior styling was way better than the Toyota. And the deal being offered made it thousand less. I know everyone talks about how the Camry delivers more on resale, but you're paying way too much up front.  And the Malibu is way more fun to drive.

I took the Malibu 4 cylinder for a test drive and really liked it, until I took the 6 cylinder for a test drive. Wow! What a smooth ride. Very comfortable and tight. The car handled our pot-holes very nicely during the test drive. The ride was supple and controlled and the noise level was very very low. The car handled like a vehicle that should cost much more. Nicely appointed and fun to drive. I touch the gas and I go! No lag in the 6 cylinder. The 4 cylinder was a little laggy for me. After my test drive, I wanted the 6 cylinder. My Prius was boring and low powered and I couldn't wait to trade it in.","OnStar, the car has it's own phone number, XM radio, and an automatic starter which is a plus in our snowy state. The exterior is pleasant and the trunk is almost too big.","The only improvement I would make is to place beefier speakers.

It comes with ABS, traction and stability control, six airbags, OnStar with turn- by-turn directions, Sirius-XM radio and so much more all standard. Ours had no options. We love the golden pewter metallic color which looks light blue sometimes and gray/silver others, depending on the light.

The six comes with hydraulic steering that gives just the right feedback.  Mileage so far is satisfactory--19.7 mpg on short hauls around town.

The 4 cyclinder engine has ample power for interstate passing and gives excellent gas mileage. We averaged 33 on the highway and 26 in the city. Priced at just around 20K Malibu is an excellent choice for those bored with Japanese cars. ,"Cabin silence, nice engine.",None.

4.75,GM finally gets it right this time,Les ,09/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,Purchased this vehicle about a month ago and now have 1300 miles on the odometer. Fuel economy in combined city/highway driving has so far been below expectations at about 24 MPG. - the same as on my 6-cylinder BMW which is much more powerful. The car handles well and is very quiet.  The black suede cloth interior is attractive and comfortable.  The  faux wood trim is tastefully done and understated. The dashboard controls are easy to use but I would have preferred to have the trip computer information made accessable and cleared by pushing and holding in the headlight stalk instead of looking for the right buttons to push.,6-speed automatic transmission. Good that GM finally replaced their outmoded and less efficient 4-speed. This new transmission is smooth and always seems to know the right gear. Confidently merging and getting up to speed on a freeway ramp with the 4- cylinder/6- speed powertrain is easy and safe.,Need to improve actual fuel economy on the 4-cylinder engine irregardless of how good the EPA numbers look on paper.  Maybe direct fuel injection would help performance and economy. Fold-down seat back on rear passenger side will not latch.  Replacement part is on order.

5,Really nice car!,Dave NJ ,09/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We traded in our '03 Malibu LS with 104,000 miles on it. No problems with the car, just miles. Our 09 Malibu 2LT is really nice. I can't get over how much better it handles and how quiet it is. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a well built fun to drive car. Chevy has really put together a nice vehicle!","I really like the driver information telling me oil life, tire pressure, gas mileage etc. seats are comfortable, remote start, sun roof everything!",None.

5,Luxury Car and Fun to Drive,Tony ,09/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The 6 speed 2.4L v4 is definitely the way to go. It has great fuel economy and is built as good as a BMW in my opinion. It is great to see that you do not need the v6 (which I had in my last car) to get the quiet ride and good acceleration. I was looking for a good family 4-door sedan that would also be fun to drive back and forth on my long commute to work (on the congested roads of NJ). Based on my budget of 20-25K, I had considered many new cars and also a low mileage BMW used car. After test driving, the Malibu was the clear winner.  My wife and I were actually shocked at how smooth and quiet the ride was (though tried to keep the smiles off our faces before negotiating the price).","Very smooth quiet ride. Great power in a small fuel efficient engine. Interior is really sharp (like a luxury car) and comfortable (despite me being 6'6""). ",Warranty requires you go back to dealer - like a Japanese car - but I can live with that

5,Camry Can't Touch This,Evan ,09/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We purchased a Camry last year for my wife because I thought they were supposed to be reliable. Well the warranty was over in one year for us because we drive alot, then we had the interior panels falling apart and the thrash engine noises and slow downshifts. Since the reliability rumors obviously wernt true, we decided to go with the facts and choose GM because they had a warranty to back it, and we couldnt have made a better choice. The interior is gorgeous and very sturdy and soft feeling. The 4 cylinder is so smooth that at 70 you can hardly hear it. Our black one with factory 19's looks very cool and you really stand out. Its a sharp contrast to the very common and boring camry we had.","Brick on black interior, sound system, seats very comfortable, responsiveness, smooth ride, gas mileage, rims, looks, stands out from the crowd in a good way","OnStar nav is really nice and surprisingly simple, but I should've waited until the screen version came out, because that is always nice to have"

5,Love this car,campbell ,08/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I did a lot of shopping around before purchasing my 09 Chevy Malibu. I have to say I fell in love with this car from the time I got behind the wheel. This car is by far the best in value and performance of other leading vehicles. I have the 2.4L4cyl and I am getting about 28 mpg on an average highway drive. It has enough horepower for me to take control of the highway driving. Love the new design of the Malibu, I have been asked by several people if the car was a BMW. This car has a European luxury style to it and looks sharp. The interior is very roomy and designed for comfort. You want options, this car has them. Love the free OnStar and the discount from the insurance company.         ","Style, fuel economy, comfort, quiet, OnStar. Roomy, 5 star crash rating. Child friendly vehicle, carseat attachments everywhere, built in sunshade, hard plastic on seatbacks, (foor little feet) airbags to protect all around. A car I feel safe and comfortable driving in. ",Chevy should have thought of this vehicle sooner.

5,I love my 2009 Malibu LTZ V6!,laurainlouisiana ,08/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had my red Malibu LTZ V6 almost 2 weeks and I absolutely love it. It looks like a million bucks - everywhere I go people ask me, ""What kind of car is that?  It's so pretty!"" It drives like a 4 door sports car and handles like a dream. So far it is getting 30-31 mpg on the hwy and 18-22 in the city. It seems to get a higher avg mpg as I get a few more miles on it. The OnStar nav is great as I have no sense of direction. The seats are beautiful and comfortable and the trunk is roomy enough for a trip for 4 for a few days in N.O. The elec plug in the back is awesome.  Everyday I find more to love about this car!  I feel like a celebrity when I drive it because everybody stares at it",OnStar navigation; electrical plug in backseat; blue ambient lighting for nighttime driving; sound system/XM radio; great gas mileage; remote start; just the overall beauty of the car itself!  It's hard to narrow it down to just a few things.,Can't think of any right now except I hope the city mpg goes up a little. The only other thing I would say is that mine did not come with side repeater lamps that LTZ is supposed to have.

5,Best all around car for the money,REN ,08/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"What's not to like about the car. It has great looks, great interior, and great on gas. This is the first car we have owned in years (Its been all SUV's for 10 years) and we love it. Nice features on the LT2. Love the dash and blue accent lights. The only down side is that after only 2 days, we had all 4 rims stolen of the vehicle!  So we had wheel locks and a ""tilt"" sensor added to the factory alarm.","Interior look - very classy looking - not too over the top. All the standard features, remote start, heated seats, nice stereo look, blue accents.","OnStar is nice for emergencies, and maintenance updates, but I'd prefer the traditional navigation system. The 4 cyl doesnt have much pep, but I'd much rather have the MPG's right now."

5,2009 LT2 4 cylinder 6 spd. automatic,BJN ,08/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We had a 2007 GM with a V6 so we were a little worried the 4 cyliner would not have enough power. To our surprise the 4 coupled with the 6 speed automatic has enough power but is also very quiet. The downshifts are subtle. Car runs 70 to 75 easily, gets excellent gas mileage getting 25 average with mostly intown so far and its only got 450 miles on it. I think when on a trip car will easily get in the mid 30 MPG range after full break in. Car is very comfortable ","The interior in the LT2 is better than many higher priced cars that we looked at. The steering wheel controls for radio, cruise and some OnStar functions are great. Also like cargo nets on sides of trunk instead of across the back",

4.75,The clear winner in it's class.,FINNS ,08/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"My wife and I tested the Altima, Camry, Accord, Mazda 6, Sonata and Ford Fusion before deciding this car was the winner. Each car had its strengths and weaknesses with options and price, but for overall solid feeling ride quality, and value the Malibu beat them all, in our opinion. I had the opportunity to drive a 2008 LS rental for several months for work and thought it was great. Testing the 2009 LTZ with 6 speed transmission seemed like a different and much nicer car altogether!  The interior is roomy and the cocoa/cashmere leather with wood accents is very attractive. The interior LED lighting is very soothing at night.  Had strangers tell us how beautiful the car is/ask questions.","The 4 cyl engine is not race car ready, but it is smooth and quiet, and merge ready. The difference between the 6 speed trans and the 4 speed is night and day! The remote start is a great factory feature, as is the auto climate control. Overall, the styling, inside and out is my favorite feature.","Maybe a bit more horsepower ( Accord is over 25 ponies higher ). The moving pedals option was removed for 2009, should have left it! Trunk space is large, but the opening is rather shallow. Upgraded stereo sounds good, but doesn't seem to reflect the large wattage. Stronger sub-woofer?"

5,2009 Malibu LTZ 4cyl,Tommy ,08/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is so sweet to drive. 4 cyl 6 speed auto transmission. On highway 65MPH tach is under 2,000 RPM. Fit and finish is good. Also very quiet 18 inch wheels. Just a sweet ride all around","Ride is so smooth yet very tight on the turns. Might be the electric steering, plus 18 inch wheels don't hurt the cornering",Nothing at this time

5,Chevrolet Rides Again!,donna ,07/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Outstanding vehicle! Think before you buy a Camry or Accord because they can't beat this vehicle. 4 cylinder has plenty of power especially when paired with the 6 speed. Turns a lot heads. If didn't have the bowtie on it you would never guess that it is a Chevy.,"33 mpg, great two-tone leather interior, great ride and performance, 6 speed transmission",None

If these are the cars coming from GM now and in the future, by stock now!  I just can't say enough great things about this car! Love It!",MP3 player and OnStar is cool! I really like the blue lights on the gauges. Awesome!,None

5,Better than expected,Duke ,07/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Our Malibu has V6 option. Very good feel with power and handling. Looking forward to after break-in to see true gas mileage. Beautiful auto.,Appearance and color. Gold Mist Metallic. Doors open and close very quietly. Easy access to all dash board features.,None at this time.
