3,"6 years, no major problems",Rail ,01/25/2016,5,,4,,,,,4,,,,We just traded our touring after 6 years of ownership. Overall a great car. Mechanically perfect until the dealer incorrectly serviced the transmission allowing it to leave the lot with no fluid. After that it would shift poorly at times.  That's not the cars fault. Otherwise it needed a new battery a couple times and that's it. Other small issues where a lift gate that would rattle at times and a brake pedal that creaked.,,

(put in a new battery recently after 100,000)  In comparison to newer cars, the real world mileage isn't great. 22- 23 city, maybe 28-30 on highway but clearly this 4 cylinder non high tech engine was not designed to be super thrifty.  That's the weak link in this car but in the end everything else, in my humble opinion, more than makes up for that, and with gas being cheap nowadays...  Oh, and the lack of blue tooth connectivity is dated.  Also compared to my other car the heating and a/c fans/outlets are weaker than most. No fancy lane change safety electronics and no knee air bags. Back storage area surface scratches easily.  Be wary of some of their dealerships.  After routine maintenance at the dealership where I originally bought the car (a bit of a distance from my home), as I was driving away, the entire rear driver wheel fell off 1/2 mile from them. (too busy to check to  tighten all the lug nuts, which I found scattered on the road) Fortunately I was not hurt and the vehicle did not sustain major damage. I had to fight with that dealership to get reimbursed for their careless and dangerous work.  Have since switched to local dealership and local private garage with good results.Had a minor issue while driving car in Canada, while still under warranty (Check engine light).  Dealership up there said that the 100,000 mile warantee did not apply over the border. I appealed this decision here, but Hyundai USA said no go. Seems absurd that they wouldn't cover a problem within the same continent.  I later learned that other companies pretty well have that same ""rule"".HOWEVER, on the MUCH larger positive side, the driver (as well as front passenger) seat is till super supportive and comfy.  Easy to drive and the I and the rest of the family still use the exceptional hauling capacity often.  Handles and parks very nimbly. (Go to car when we go to big cities because of size and ease of parking)  Visibility is really good especially compared to other car I drive. . With snow tires the vehicle is awesome in winter. I got up my steep driveway this winter, with 12"" of snow.Sad that they don't make these any more. The GT, which replaces this model, is a totally different vehicle with no where near the same hauling capacity.",,

Not easy to find with the manual transmission - but I preferred the performance of the Hyundai 2.0 engine with 5 spd over the Toyota Matrix 1.8 engine.  Some reviewers have found this car to ride a little rough, but personally I think other Hyundai models are a little too spongy.  This car is very roomy for its size - I managed to get a 9 cu. ft. freezer in the back with room to spare.  More than enough space for four adults - rear seats are another advantage over the Toyota Matrix or Mazda 3 hatchbacks.

I now have a bone spur on my heel, so this very reliable car suddenly did not meet my needs. I had to trade up to a small crossover SUV, which wound up not being another Hyundai. Like Honda, the Hyundai seats seem to be made for durability rather than comfort. Big people like me may find them a bit uncomfortable. Also, it seems that most other drivers on the road hate the way this car looks, so they are constantly trying to push this underpowered car out the way. It also looked like each driver behind me was sitting in my cargo area. A bit unnerving!","The iPod interface, but many other auto makers now also have them.

Good list of standard features for the price opted for the sports package with 17 inch wheels and sunroof.,Driving experience handles great stops on a dime.  Can't beat the warranty. Nice and tight vehicle.,Sometimes a little tough getting into reverse and second gear.  Needs highway gear.

The elantra touring was perfect. Plenty of room, great road manners, quite and great warranty. She was driving a rodeo and at first missed the seat height of the SUV, but really loved the way the elantra touring drove. Every day she tells me how she loves her new car.

I was looking for another wagon and was really happy when Hyundai returned to the wagon market with the touring.  I've had the car for a little over 2 months and 4000 miles and am very happy with it.  I live in a mountainous area and average 37-38 MPG in mixed speed driving, all 65 mph or under. There is almost as much interior room as the '99 wagon.  The seats are comfortable for driving long distances.  The Edmunds site was very helpful in purchasing and knowing what price to expect.","Never thought I would like XM radio, but it's great.  Wagon body style is great for carrying ""stuff."" Reasonably good mileage.  Height adjustable drivers seat. Lots of features included at a reasonable price.",Roof carrier option would be good and rear seats to fold down flat.

4.125,This is not a good stepdown for a SUV,SUV step down? ,10/06/2009,,,4,3,4,5,,4,4,4,5,This is not a step down vehicle from a SUV or minivan as i was told and as i reviewed for several reasons. Do not get me wrong It is a good vehicle but it is not a step down vehicle as there are several flaws for it to be that. See below. also the hatch area is flimsy at best and do suggest getting a heavy floor mat as a jug of milk that hit the side actually dented the built in felt mat. Towing capacity is less then smaller cars I was looking at and so is usable space. No roof rack or attachments to put your own.all in all don't get a touring get the base model pick your own trim level. Get to another vehicle if you need any storage space over what a trunk will hold. This is disappointment.,Looks great I had to get the sports package as they where out of the lower package and made no difference to me. It looks great handles well. I Like the warranty and the brand They dealership is top in its class for service and now i see why. This is a perfect car if you want a small hatch back.,heavy build in rear area felt. more usable space they way it is designed no object even at in angle that is four feet fits. It has less usable space then several smaller hatchbacks and the front passenger seat either dose not move enough to be helpful even six foot object wont go in with seats down.

Needless to say, I hit my head on the steering wheel (no airbag deployed!), and my knee hit the dash/column really hard (no air bag here!).  I've been waiting 1 month to get it back from the autobody and let's just say that once I get it back I'm selling it and buying something bigger and more substantial.  I do not feel safe driving this car any longer.  It's too small, and not built to withstand accidents.

Took one long trip so far, and did manage to get little over 26 MPG on that trip. That was in the rolling hills of CA. I would question why AC in the glove box. My bigest complaint is the position of the steering wheel post on the lower part of the steering wheel. It is right where you would put your hands. I assume they had to put it there to support the air bag? It is unconfortable to hold the steering wheel on the lower part. Drivers seat could be fore confortable!",Large cargo area for a small car.

I have also owned VW GTI S I can't say that this even compares but my dollar bought one sweet ride. The real deal would have much more needed power and some quite tires they are really loud on some roads. Its a poor man sports wagon I hope I have similar luck with this Hyundai as others have with the Sonatas it seems like every body likes them even when they have hundreds of thousand's of miles. So as of now I only have a few thousand I would recommend this wagon to a friend or even my brother that I did. Good luck on your future purchase other cars to check would be Mazda 3 but will cost you a few more dollars and they don't have a warranty as good.,So So much there's to much to list it comes standard with all you really need  ,"turbo power, 5 speed AT. rear spolier, and factory dark tint windows for rear"

Best mpg to date is 37 mpg on a long cruise-controlled drive to New York state and back! Someone else, here, noted an issue with the cd player: cracks and pops from a brand new cd. But I don't care, really. Who even WANTS to listen to cds what with the fabulous XM radio music selection?! Contrary to my earlier request for more horsepower, it really doesn't need it. The Touring has ample get-up-and-go for this 55 y.o. And I'm still discovering neat design features that Hyundai engineering deserves great kudos for. ",Headlights shutoff automatically when car is locked via remote. Five-speed manual transmission. Cornering capability. XM Radio. Plenty of storage in rear end. Plenty of passenger compartment storage cubbies. Comfortable cockpit. Excellent headlights.,I honestly can't think of anything. Hyundai engineering REALLY thought this car's design out well.

A Chili Pepper red Elantra Touring just begging to be bought. Took a quick test drive and told the salesman to put a sold sign on it. Easiest decision I ever made. I absolutely love this car. Quick, precise steering, peppy enough and, to my eyes, a beauty to behold (love the color). Throw in great brakes, XM radio, handling that makes Ozark mountain curves a blast to drive and lots of room to haul stuff in and you have one happy owner. I'm getting 29.7 MPG combined. The stiff suspension (which I like)is the price you pay for good handling.                ","Roomy, well designed interior. I appreciate the little touches like the retractable tonneau cover in the back. XM radio was an unexpected extra that I enjoy. The brakes are exceptional! The exterior styling is as good looking as any hatchback on the road. Oh, did I mention the color?  ",After almost 600 miles I have yet to find anything that would improve this car without driving up the price. Sure a turbo version would be nice but it would probably add too much to the price of what is really an outstanding bargain.

The Toyota well for the older car it was great on fuel but I couldn't ask for a better car.,"Its got the Jeep feel with GREAT fuel economy.

I am planning on having the sunroof put in around tax time, but the chilli pepper red is sharp looking.",I think out of anything the plastic tape wrap on my driver side door there are a few chips on and Hyundai doesn't want to fix it.

The elantra touring is the same model as one they sell over seas and it shows in the handling, the car handles like a sport car. It comes with eltronic stability control which also helps in this department. I got 30 mpg second tank and the driving  consisted of about 45% city and 55% highway driving. I love the bluetooth which will dial your cell phone with voice commands. The only dislikes are the dinky horn,  come on Hyundai with todays quite cars it likely won't even be hear if someone has their Windows up and the radio on, also the key and remote should be combined.","bluetooth,dash design,handling,blue lighted instruments,xm radio,quiet ride,good gas mileage","louder horn is a must, combine remote and key"

4.875,Duly Impressed,pseudo ,08/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Got this towards the very end of the clunker deal.  I settled on getting the Touring after looking at a variety of hatchbacks, from a Nissan Versa at the low-end to a Subaru Impreza at the high end.  Unfortunately for me, these things are extremely popular and after looking for one for nearly 2 weeks, I got the color I wanted (Vivid Blue) but I didn't get the premium package I wanted in time(sun roof, etc.)  Immediately noticed is the quality of the interior and how pleasing it is to look at.  I'd say only the Mazda3speed is more sporty looking. Got the Automatic & drives like a breeze.  Not real sporty but way more so than my old Pathfinder.  All in all, a great car! Highly recommend it!   ","Interior is surprisingly nice, in my opinion.  XM Radio, Ipod hook-up. Speaker system is nice.  Comfortable and smooth drive.  Pleasing exterior. Better than advertised gas mileage. (about 32 hgwy). Very quiet inside. Great AC.  Plenty of compartments for stuff.  TONS of cabin and luggage room!","I started looking around August 8th but couldn't get the exact thing i wanted. (no sunroof)  Now that I have it, I also wished I went Manual transmission, but there were none of those in the NJ,NY,PA area at the end of Clunkers.  A little more pep while maintaining gas mileage if that's possible."

Looks like they took all of the good features of all the other look alikes on the market and put into this model.  Its got just enough more room in it than the competition to be noticeable, and comes standard with all the features we wanted. So far we're getting about 30 mpg in mixed driving.  We bought a Mazda 3 5dr last year and between the two, the Mazda's a little more fun to drive - better handling and power, but the Hyundai is more comfortable on a long trip.","Lots of inside room and very comfortable for a large driver like myself. Lots of nice small touches, holder in the right places, controls very logical, retractable privacy cover in the rear - they really thought out this car. ","Only thing I've found to dislike is the stereo display.  It's big and blue, and can't be turned off at night. It absolutely wrecks your night vision. We ended up making a cover for it for extended night driving. A touch more power would be nice, but I'm not sure I've give up mileage for it. "

While many wish for more HP, I feel it is satisfactory for what the car is designed to do, get you from point A-B as economically as possible with as much comfort as possible. This car achieves these goals. The steering is certainly lacking that ""Hug the road"" feel. The brakes work well with plenty of stopping power.

That's 39.2 miles per gal highway at 70 mph. I think it would have been higher if we did not get stuck in a 5 mile crawl to the Bourne bridge. In city seems to be about 31.5 miles per gal.   The ride was very comfortable. No back pains like in other cars. The car handled great on uneven surface for repaving. I am loving this car more now than when I first got it. Good going Hyundai!,Plenty of room. Good layout of all components. Great car so far. Will wait for winter to see how it handles then. XM radio great. Plenty of power outlets.

I test drove everything in this class, and some larger, and found nothing that compared to the Touring, especially in its generous features.  My touring has solid handling, turns on a dime and delivers everything it promised.  I love the sporty exterior look and the roomy interior.  I am amazed that Hyundai could offer so many features for the price...sunroof, blue tooth, xm capability (3 months free), 17"" nitro-fill tires and much more, .  The others I tested couldn't come close.  This sweet car is a keeper! ","Easy to enter and exit the vehicle (seats are a nice height).

Fuel economy is as expected 27-32 MPG, averaging 29 MPG in mostly highway commuting. It is very comfortable and easy to climb in and out of. Luggage space rivals an SUV.

Loading and unloading is a breeze as the cargo area is wide, flat, and at a good height. The hatch door is not too tall to reach when I need to close it and I am short (5'2"").

The cargo space, dash controls, satellite radio, gas mileage, and most of all the safety features won me over.","Safety features, cool exterior/interior designs, gas mileage (31mpg highway), hatchback-so convenient and voluminous! Great stereo and satellite radio.","The back of the seats make you sweat a little, driving feel is a little off - I'm taking it to the dealer tomorrow to check for alignment."

4.125,Good car for SUV withdrawal,Gearcrasher ,06/02/2009,,,5,4,4,5,,3,4,4,4,"Lots of interior room for SUV owners like me looking for better gas mileage. Steering is a little strange but getting used to it. Power to weight ratio is not very sporting but can keep up with traffic. Driver's leg room is shorter than specs suggest. I've never had a car that stopped as well. Styling is very Euro and to my liking but doesn't turn heads. Nice exterior finish and good quality materials on interior,(no mouse fur). Some sloppy workmanship in more hidden areas, i.e. messy chauking in door jams. Wiring looms hand wrapped with cloth electrical tape,(didn't know they still made that). Getting 23mpg in suburban driving. That's almost double my Hemi Durango!",Excellent value for cost. Roomy. Stops well. USB port. XM radio. Alloy wheels. Comfortable seats.,"Bring Diesel to US market. Allow drivers seat to slide back further. ""Shiftable"" five speed automatic. Smoother engine."

4.25,Elantra Touring great buy,mark ,06/02/2009,,,4,4,5,4,,4,5,4,4,"I traded in my 2000 Elantra for this new Touring. You will like the new improved model.  Outside the car it comes with a euro-style which is a much better upgraded than the old Pontiac nose.  Inside plenty of room. Seats are very comfortable front and back. Plenty of hiding place for stuff. AC glove box to keep a can of soda cold or medications cool in summer.  Radio is great for what you get, it gets the job done.  The motor has good pick up for a Wagon, that's what it is. Would like to see a 2.3 or 2.4 liter motor though. Getting 30.7 mi. per gal. Over all good price and ride for a under 20,000 dollar car. Warranty can't be beat.  ","AC great, Radio good. Dependable car. Good family car with a little sportiness. ",2.3 or 2.4 motor 170 to 180 horse power. needs blue tooth capable set up. Gps option would be nice to.

4.625,New and it's a jem,John R ,05/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"Nearly perfect sporty commuter with room for the toys on the weekend. Fantastic value for the money. Gives 30 mpg in very mixed driving. Nothing seems cheap. It's very well done. It's the most car you can put around a 2000cc engine. Not a rocket ship, but more than enough go for a great daily driver. ","Room, everything standard, interior, ride & handling, value (traction control, esc, etc.),fuel mileage. Even looks great (in silver with pin striping).","A little more padding for the front seats. A little more feel in the steering, and add some reclining to the rear seat backs."

4.875,Love This Car!,psimm215 ,05/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I bought this car (my second Hyundai) a couple of weeks ago and I love it. I picked the car up on my way out of town for a weekend road trip (500 miles round trip). My destination was in the Tenn mountains, on the way back I got a surprising 38.9 mpg. The ride was very comfortable and pretty quiet. We put the back seats down and filled the cargo space with donations for a local food bank, it held over 600 items with room to spare so we only had to make one trip. I live in Atlanta so my city mpg has only been around 25, I expect that to improve as the engine breaks in. Rick Case bumped up the warranty to 20 yrs, 200,000 miles so I think I will keep this car for many years. ","Ipod connector, moon roof and sport wheels. Love the chili pepper red!","Better lumbar support and tinted windows, black interior really heats up here in Hotlanta"

4.875,Love the Touring,Liz ,05/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Had a 1992 Honda Civic hatchback before this and wanted another Civic but I found I could get more for my money with the Touring. I've driven if for about 600 miles so far and I love it more each day. It has everything I was looking for and more; good safety features, lots of cargo space, fun to drive, my tall friends say the backseat is much more spacious than expected and very comfortable. I got the vivid blue color and it's awesome. I also love the black interior but it does show anything left behind of the fabric like lint from clothing. I would suggest the sports package (sunroof, 17 inch alloy wheels, and heated seats). I'm getting on average around 24-25 MPG (mostly city driving).","Comes with a lot of extra features I wasn't even looking for but I really like them. Sunroof, fog lights, silver trimming on knobs and lights, XM radio, iPod adapter (although I've only used XM radio so far), display blackout, steering wheels radio controls, cruise control, perfect arm rest location","While the gas mileage is ok, if this car got slightly better gas mileage I would find it perfect. I also think it would be cool if the hatch window went down like in SUVs."

4.125,Solid Compact Utility Vehicle,FamilyontheWay ,05/16/2009,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,4,4,"I'm ""stepping down"" from a decade of owning cars costing $10k more. I bought this for the high reliability (I'm expecting) and the value it represents. It may be hard to wrap your head around that fact that this is a compact car, with a midsize wheelbase and tremendous interior space. It IS fun to drive, though not sporty, but torquey, taut and surprisingly refined. It's not fast, but competent and capable around town and on the hiway. It has a ""do anything"" demeanor, but rides like a car, not an SUV. The biggest drawbacks being the 4 speed auto, oddly weighted steering and the 2L engine that makes only 140 Hp. But brakes are excellent, built quality high, and the interior well thought out.","Am getting about 28mpg mixed. I've got bluetooth, which is okay. Have all my music on a USB stick, plug it in to the ""secret compartment"" and 170 watts sounds good enough. Oh, and the dash lights in red, white and blue - very classy. All in all, the cabin is well appointed and fun for the price.","Hate the steering feel. It fights in sweeping turns a little like a shopping cart with a bum wheel. Maybe there's too much caster in the alignment? Wish the interior cloth was nicer, maybe not so black. Really want the The taII motor w/160 Hp and a stiffer chassis. A little sharper exterior styling?"

4.625,Lots of bang for your buck,frankjanet ,05/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"We've owned it for over a month and had one long road trip.  We've loaded it with 3 passengers and 18 2""x10"" four foot long boards along with a roll of fencing.  We love the capacity and functionality of it.  It was comfortable on the trip.  Gas mileage was decent, but a 5 speed auto would be great. We've been getting ~26mpg and that's mostly around town including a carpool line.  Considering it is a compact car, it's a great car for a small family.  We got the premium package and the ride isn't very bumpy.  We also haven't found the steering to be vague as mentioned in some reviews.","iPod adapter, interior layout, cool blue lights at night, heated seats and cargo capacity.","More power to assist in merging, a five speed auto, and more manuals available."

5,Great Small Hatchback,CityDriver ,04/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Wanted something smaller that my Camry, without giving up comfort or rear seat space.  This car has both, along with a big cargo capacity due to hatchback instead of a trunk.  Compared to the Toyota Matrix, the Elantra Touring has more standard safety and convenience features, and slightly more space.  The 2.0l engine with manual transmission is a great combination - very good acceleration when I need it, but the gas mileage is much better than EPA rating of 26 overall (more like 30 but haven't been running the A/C).  Haven't had it out for a long trip yet, but for commuting and light hauling, this is a great size and a comfortable ride.","XM radio, standard safety features, good space for passengers and cargo, sporty handling in a practical car. Ability to black out the radio display at night is a nice touch.",Fold-flat front passenger seat.

I never had any problems in six years which is why we bought another one. I can't believe all the standard equipment it comes with. Very fun to drive and sporty looking in the silver. Got right on 26 mpg city on the first tank. Can't wait for a road trip!","all standard safety features, XM radio and sunroof, large cargo area",lighter grey interior since black shows every speck of dust and lint immediately. 5 speed shiftable auto.

It's the Euro Wagon from Hyundai. Price was much lower than a similarly equipped Mazda3.","16 inch alloys, iPod/mp3 plug-in, 8 airbags, fog lights, touring seats, what's there not to like.

Still haven't figured out if it's a car, crossover or what, but who cares, it is a pleasure to drive.  I saw this car, searched for an automatic, and bought it at once.","Radio, stability, performance, handling ",Can't think of any except the air conditioner button should be a little more difficult to engage.

4.5,better than you'd expect - by far,frequentt buyer ,03/26/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"I bought an 09 elantra touring on Monday.  Got $500 of sticker, and $1000 rebate.

Peppy acceleration, tons of room and legitimate 30+ mpg highway/26 in town.  100,000 mile warranty too","shiftable automatic (slap sideways to go from 4th to 3rd), fuel economy, acceleration, standard abs, esc, traction control, disc brakes, heated mirrors.  huge cargo area behind the 2nd seat.  huge legroom in the second row",tinted windows not avail.  maybe a 5th gear to kick highway mpg up to 35+?  great car overall.

4.625,Brand New CAr,scottygirl ,03/14/2009,,,4,5,5,4,,4,5,5,5,Just bought the new Hyundai Touring brand new to this country. So far it has been fun to drive. I like the way it handles in the city.It was between this car and a Honda Accord. The touring sits up a little higher then the Honda. Also got more for my money and a trip odometer.,I like how the dash board lights up with displays (LED lights),I have only had it for 24 hours  to early to say right now.
