5,My favorite ugly duckling,Richard Kelly ,06/25/2016,,,,,,,,4,5,,,"I will start off to say most hated the first glimpse of the new fourth generation TL platform when it released in late 2008, but I believe it is an acquired taste. My previous car was a Honda S2000 and when I was exiting my ownership of that vehicle I was worried I would soon be stranded into a mundane driving experience. This was not the case. For a near 4000lbs car that barely breach's 300hp at the crank it moves quite nicely. I live in a rather snowy climate (number two snowiest city in the US) and while I got around with snow tires in the S2000 just fine, the SH-AWD TL was awesome even on all seasons, not to mention a blast of mash, steer and go. The car is well laid out as far as controls and technology and is very user friendly once accommodated with all the functions. It is incredibly spacious for my height and for a mid-size vehicle. Most of all, the build quality and material choice makes me appreciate the interior when compared to other vehicles in its used price range. The technology package delivers a pretty nice stock sound system with a very conservative navigation display. Beware that with this sound system the door speakers are prone to blowing out. However they are $25 to replace and this vehicles door panels are by far the most user friendly to take on and off. Seriously if you've taken door panels off before they are usually a nightmare of clips breaking, but that is not the case here. Overall I am very pleased with the value of this car for roughly $19,000 used with 50,000 miles when bought over a year ago. The Mayan Bronze Metallic color is quite beautiful as well.",,

I thought I was the only one. this is my 2nd TL and I really don't know why I ever got rid of the first one. I recently traded in my 3 series BMW for this and needless to say I am not disappointed. The TL has a great features ( even on the base model ) that BMW does not offer. the acceleration is phenomenal and the ride is quiet and smooth. it is very easy to set up the electronics in the vehicle as well. the one thing I am missing from the Beamer is the how tight the steering is. in the Acura it is a lot easier to just push the wheel from side to side. also, the leather could be a little better quality. other than that, I think the car is amazing and would recommend it to anyone.  as for the design... I think it is a very attractive car. the grill is aggressive looking while the rest of the car just looks luxurious. all in all I am pleased with the trade.",,

I was looking for something comparable to my '06 525i and struggled with the decision to trade it. But after owning the TL for over a month & a half, the trade was well worth it. I'm a big techy person and having all the features that the TL comes with was like putting a kid in a candy store. My 525i didn't even have a quarter of those features & to get them would've cost thousands. I was also concerned about the speed between RWD & FWD. But the TL has proved itself to be just as good in that area. Also, I believe the TL has the reliability that I've been looking for...which I didn't have with the 525i.","Tech pkg (HDD, Bluetooth Audio, Voice Commands, Nav, Paddle Shifters, Keyless Entry/Ignition...I mean the list goes on & on.), Sleek exterior design, Comfortable interior, Smooth ride, Luxury feel with an affordable price tag.

This is my third Acura, the first, a 1999 model, was the best car that I had ever owned up until that time, the second was a 2002 (all TLs) pretty much like the first, and this 2009 model is fantastic...  The only problem that I've had was with the driver's seat bolster wearing prematurely...worth the money spent...",Back up camera in the tech package... Handling ability...

Having driven the 330i, decided it's no longer for my taste; the BMW demanded my attention at all times. One wrong move and the kidney grills head into the wrong lane. TL is more forgiving for daily driving. It just depends on what you want. My goal with the current purchase was fast, quiet and comfortable, plus solid reliability to boot. Styling is purely subjective, so say what you will about the TL styling, it's just an opinion and preference. Build quality is excellent compared to my previous cars, Lexus IS250, BMW 330i and 525i.

Overall, though, the ride is good and the cabin is very quiet. Also, the tech package is a must. Easy to use and I use the real time weather a lot more than I thought I would. And I like the front/back design. It is edgy/different.",Technology package; handling; paddle shifters; sound quality of the stereo system (I find myself not wanting to get out of the car); gas mileage is surprisingly better than I thought it would be; interior quality (just feels/looks luxurious); seats--they just hug your body; engine power/acceleration.,"Like a lot of other reviewers, I wish the TL had rain sensing wipers; power telescopic steering wheel; more ambient lighting in the interior; a little bit less of a stiff ride."
4.625,This car turns heads!!  (in a good way),chuckz53 ,09/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"I absolutely love the styling inside and out.  There has been some criticism in the press about looks, but to me it looks strikingly different and fresh.  Same with the inside.  There's a knock on the the multitude of buttons, bit I rarely go to the console because everything is voice activated, and besides, that's so much more fun.  The novelty of saying ""set driver temperature 70 degrees"" still isn't wearing off. Being a Honda, I'm sure reliability will be bullet proof. Acceleration is OK, but I do give it low scores for handling - my only disappointment.  Once you set up for a turn it's stable and secure, but transitions and aggressive moves are not this car's forte. Still, a great car.",Tech package gives you features that cost $15K extra in the German cars. You pop in a CD and guess what? It's automatically copied to the hard drive. You can just sit in the car listening to beautiful music being bathed in soft leather and it doesn't matter if the missus is 45 minutes late.,Handling.  If torque were biased to the rear the car would feel more responsive.  Steering could be tighter and the shocks more athletic. Then the car would be damn near perfect.

Technology beats other competitors like G37 or 08 TL. But not sure why such an advanced car has to skip auto-dimmed side mirrors, ventilated seats, rain-sensing wiper, etc. On a 08' TL I don't have to pay for the tech package to get ELS sound system and the perforated leather. Still a very good car for the price level, but option-wise, you want to ask yourself what's really important to you vs. what it has to offer.        ","Nav, ELS sound system, handling on SH- AWD when pushing it, aggressive look and feel, interior room (better than 5- series). ",SH-AWD too sensitive and stiff. Better OEM rim and tires (avoid Turanza EL400). I would say replace the stock tires with better ones on SH-AWD if you care about needless stiffness. Larger trunk size.

I recently purchased 09 TL AWD with the Tech Package. I upgraded from a 2004 Honda Accord V6 that had 163K Miles on it. What convinced me to buy and Acura was the reliability of my Honda and the trade-in value of my car. When the dust settled I walked out the door paying $30K with my trade-in.  I looked at several competitors but kept coming back to Acura. The handling of the TL AWD and the Tech Package won me over. I plan to keep the car for 5-years and expect it will be very reliable and hold it's value when it comes time to trade it in.  If you don't look at the TL you miss out on an excellent vehicle.

Cons: 1) suspension is too stiff that you can feel every tiny, tiny bump of the road. Any ride longer than 10 minutes in the city is not enjoyable. 2) back trunk is relatively high for putting away heavier objects and it's small as well. 3) Some of the interior materials feel cheap: plastic of door pockets bring the car down. 4) seats are not comfortable as the previous two TL models I had driven.

However, in city driving, I am only averaging 14.3 mpg (according to the computer). Hopefully, the mpg will get better as more miles are racked up. I have had nothing but raves from friends and co-workers about the exterior and interior of the car. I chose Palladium Metallic with the taupe interior.

Trust me, when you see this car in person, it looks great. It's very bold, distinctive and really stands out. Beautiful lines everywhere. The interior is also beautifully designed. You can see the beautiful lines and really see and feel the high level of craftsmanship. As well done and even more so compared to Audi interiors. Everything feels great. It has a powerful and smooth engine that can satisfy all but the most discriminating owners. The ride and handling is a perfect balance between sport and comfort. Drive the TL and you'll see how special this is. It's style, technology and luxury at its best.","Distinctive styling, well-crafted interior and the quiet and smooth, but still sporting ride.

Every detail was thought of, even windshield wipers that no longer leave a streak of water on the windshield in front of driver's eyes. The interior is very high tech, functional and not boring. The suspension is now softer and the bumps are forgiving. It's wider and longer, so it gives you a lot more space. The tech package makes this car even better.

The SH-AWD system is amazing, and after driving it back to back against the 335i and G37, there's simply no comparison.  While the other two might be a little quicker in a straight line, they can't match the handling of this car.  Plus, their interiors looked really cheap compared to how luxurious the TL is, and both felt really cramped. Concerning all the comments about the exterior, I have to admit I wasn't sure about it at first.  But the more I look at the car the more I love it.

Because I'm hearing impaired, I've never been able to enjoy a car sound system.  Now, I open the roof, turn on the XM radio and hear clearly....wow!

You think about going around a corner and you're there.  The ride is a little stiff but that's the price one pays for the performance, at least until you get into cars costing three times as much.  The gas mileage isn't great, but after all its not a hybrid.  Still, if you go easy on it, it's a lot better than you'd expect.

I've never seen a better nav system and I come from owning a Lexus ES350. The screen is gorgeous. Power is incredible for a car that gets this kind of mpg.

Steering is razor sharp, suspension is just the perfect combination of compliant and firm (the SH-AWD package was too firm for my taste).

We traded a 1999 TL for the 2009 TL. What really sets off the new TL is its sculpted looks and flowing lines; however, I must admit that the front grille is a bit overdone. Although the dash controls look complicated, they are well marked and do not take long to figure out. Seats are comfortable (but not pillow like), with great support for the back.

The radio and navigation packages are simple to use and the resolution of the navigation screen is almost high definition.  The overall quality of the car is also top notch, it is a very well made car. And the  ride is that of a luxury car, it does not ride like a sports car. So it's fun to drive on the expressway, when you are going 70 mph, but around town it doesn't handle like a sports car. A little boring in the city.

5,Beyond expectations,al ,01/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've waited for this car since first trying the 2005 RL, which I found to be too soft. This 2009 TL is really superior. Even in low speeds, on side streets, there's no feeling of nose-heavy understeer. On highway on/off ramps, in spite of having had snow, sleet and wet pavement, it's been holding the road as if on rails. The brakes are superb - which is the first time in an Acura (I've owned six before), that I do not feel that need to be upgraded. So as I stated, this car is, definitely, much better then all Acuras that I greatly enjoyed before, as well as much beyond my expectations of it.","Seats fit like a glove.

Love the rear camera, and Acura reliability is a plus.",Upgraded wheels and tires should be standard on a car with this much luxury.  I chromed mine and it made a big difference.  Could have a bit more room for passengers in the back.
4.875,Awesome new TL,PMcK ,12/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love the new TL.  This is my third TL in a row (04' and 06') and it is by far the best one I've every owned.  Like many I was skeptical about the exterior styling, but I've had nothing but thumbs up.  I live in Canada and with the winter tires it handles fantastically well.  I love the iPod interface and the bluetooth.  I also love the ticker steering wheel, I only wish it was heated.  I also love the paddle shifters and that you can shift gears while the transmission is still in drive.  I'm a little disappointed in some of the material used like the interior door handle.  Overall I definitely would recommend this car.","Paddle shifters and seamless shifting , bluetooth, iPod interface, keyless entry and the SH-AWD.  Nice engine noise.  Great sound system (much better than previous TLs)  Nice supportive front seats.","Heated steering wheel, Bi-xenon headlights, coin slots, heated back seats."
4.875,2009 TL with SH-AWD,MikeATL ,12/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"My first TL and I now understand all the hype surrounding Acura engineering. The attention to details, the technology, superior handling in snow and ice conditions, and respectable performance for a luxury sports sedan. Looked at Mercedes, BMW and Caddy... no contest!! I really enjoy all the conveniences and I am quickly getting a handle on the voice activated command system. Keyless start is a really is a nice feature as well. Paddle shifters really makes it feel like a performance vehicle. The safety features are second to none, meeting 2010 standards today!","Build quality and long list of standard equipment. Safety features. Quietness and sound system. Finally a comfortable driving position for my 6'3"" frame! Engine smoothness and responsiveness. Ride smoothness. ","So where is the sunglass holder??  Also ride quality is a bit too firm on rough roads. Minor problems, but it might just complete a near perfect car.  "
5,Harry Potter's Broomstick,Harry's Fan ,12/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was debating between the 2008 Lexus ES350 and this Acura.  I am so happy that I have made the perfect choice to bring it home.  I love it.  The driving is very smooth and powerful.  I am driving a lot everyday, the MPG is around 28 on freeway.  The seats are very comfortable.  I love the design inside out.  I did not purchase the tech. package, but came with the car are the bluetooth, iphone connection features.  ","Heated seats, sound system, comfortable leather seats, USB connection, horse power, personal key setting","At this point, I have not found anything to add yet."
4.75,Fun car to drive,bronzeacura ,12/16/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I have owned my Acura for three weeks now. I am a little disappointed, because I had to take it back to the dealer for a problem with the rear passenger door. A sensor is not working properly and causing the alarm go off. Otherwise, this car is a lot fun. The technology is second to none. No other car offers the same package of technology. This car is much smoother and better built than the 2006 model which I had owned for three years. My only regret is not getting the AWD. ","The technology package! Live traffic, iPod interface and hard drive to upload all your CDs, weather forecast, which is limited but cool. Key less entry and start!",Remote starter! 
5,2009 TL-tech,JeffXP ,12/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"As soon as you start to initiate a corner the suspension grabs the road feeling even more secure; I don't know how they accomplished this and I wish I had a picture to show you the linkage near the rear tires. There's days I like to slumber home and the new TL coddles you home. Put the gear shifter into sport mode using the paddle shifters and the suspension seems to tighten up (I wonder if it has to do with the transmission either advancing the vehicle or slowing the car down when you let off the accelerator) when you want to race around, nice. Ipod, flash and hard drive integration are easy to use and once you get used to them you wonder how you lived without them.","Second day I was coming home from the gym and threw my bag in the trunk and couldn't close the door, the trunk wouldn't lock and kept popping back open with an audible alert (I thought oh no is it broken), but finally I realized the key fob was in my gym bag, won't let you lock your keys in trunk.","If I had to search for an improvement, you can never have too much light for the high beams. Otherwise the car is a pleasure to drive."
4.875,First Time TL Owner,Randy S ,12/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I've owned Hondas in the past and upgraded to the TL.  Love the car.  Lot of tech w/voice controls, XM radio, etc.  Holds the road well, good acceleration and getting 27 mpg on the highway commute with about 600 miles on the car.  My only complaint is the seat is very stiff and will probably prove tiring on a long trip.",The nav display is very clean and easy to handle.  Backup camera is a nice touch and the voice commands.,"Vented seats and larger tires for sure.  Make the backup sensor standard instead of a dealer add-on because even with the camera, there are blind spots."
5,Bold,Bold ,12/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I compared the RL with the TL and there is no comparison. The TL has a better drive, better gas mileage, more pickup and cost $5,000 less. I was surprised that the two models are about the same size. The AWD is great in the snow. I previously had a BMW 750 and am not disappointed. It takes time to learn how to use all the features. ","Nav system, style, AWD, handling, and acceleration.","Would like to have had a remote start, power trunk closer."
4.75,What's not to love?,OldBarr ,11/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I love this car. Its my 3rd Acura and my favorite by far. I wasn't sure about the rotating wheel on the navigation system at first but now that I have driven it for a few weeks, I have completely changed my mind. No more glare on the screen, it almost looks high def. I looked at other cars (infinity G35, Honda Accord and Nissan Maxima) just to see how it compared and I think I got the best car for my money. Its luxurious in the inside and and the tech package makes a tech freak like me very very happy.","Back up camera, iPod connection, HDD, XM traffic/weather, bluetooth, etc., just about EVERYTHING standard in the tech package. ",No premium tires.
5,New TL owner,Zman ,11/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5," My last three cars now have been Acuras, an 04TL and a 06RL. I've been waiting for the 09 all summer. The wait was well worth it. Having driven the SHAWD RL, I wish I didn't have to sacrifice that option for the tech package but I wanted the audio upgrade more. I am very happy. The car handles great with a nice feel for the road. Plenty of power with a luxury interior. The audio and nav system is great. Big improvement over the 06RL.This car is really a cross between the TL and RL. I realize there are many choices out there for $40K. But for my money the 09 TL Tech fills my needs quite well. One more thing, just get in it and drive. Don't worry about all the tech stuff, settings, etc., figure out later.","Audio/Tech system. Just getting used to iPod thing so I miss the 6 CD changer. 5.1 audio is awesome. Weather updates incredible. Back/up camera, wow. I'm driving home backwards from work next week. Seats are very supportive and comfortable. Plenty of interior room. This car is a head turner. "," Add a CD changer, nicer wheels along with vented seats of course. "
4.875,SH-AWD TL is a monster,SDGates ,11/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This week I drove the first new TL SH-AWD off the lot here in NYC and this car is nothing short of an absolute black top carving rocket. I drove the front wheel drive model which was nice but can't hold a candle to the power and handling of the SH-AWD version. The tight power and control carves through turns and is every bit  the powerful car Acura has ever built. The Tech package give you everything you could need from a fast, clear nav system with tons of features, iPhone integration including music and phonebook. I owned a TL from the previous generation and this new version improves on everything that I didn't like about the old version and the SH-AWD makes it into the car I always wanted.","SH-AWD power and handling, nav system (fast, clear with tons of features), iPhone integration including music and phonebook, voice recognition that can control about every feature of the car",Ability to change incoming call tone
5,Class Value Leader!,TLDeac ,11/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Having driven many competitive vehicles (bmw, lexus, audi, cadillac, infiniti, etc), the value of the 2009 TL is simply in a class of its own.  With excellent power, a very comfortable ride, and an amazing tech package, this car has been a blast to own.  Also, after a couple of 600 mile road trips, I am averaging 28 mpg highway and around 20 mpg in the city.  Outstanding fuel economy for a car this powerful.  I do miss having a RWD powertrain, but Acura has mostly eliminated the torque steer from their previous efforts, and I am sure the fwd helps with fuel economy. A little more body roll than I want, but a comparable 5 series bmw that offers better cornering was 15K+.","Tech package is a blast, with iPod, bluetooth, doppler radar (crazy), and a nav system with 7M+ points of interest.  Shift paddles make ramps and passing more fun, as well as engine breaking.  Styling has actually gotten great reviews from friends as well as most passerby (many thumbs up)","Upgrade the wheels! 17"" look SMALL on this vehicle, and make handling a little softer than need be.  Also would like to see ventilated seats, and maybe a wood package interior, although the aluminum is sharp."
5,Gimme More!,frankrizzo ,11/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"What can I say, 4th Acura and it gets better every time. I didn't like the grille at 1st, but I had it painted to match the body color and its a lot better. Walks away from the competition in every aspect!",280hp!!!,Nicer wheels would be nice. But the aftermarket options are endless!
5,Honda engineering = Peace of mind!,japruss paddington ,10/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"A few weeks ago I purchased this 2009 Acura TL and absolutely love it! This Acura TL is super quiet, super smooth  super fast and super solid. It tracks like a locomotive and never loses its composer. I traded a 2008 Lexus ES350 for this Acura and I am very proud of my decision. The Lexus felt cheap and sloppy when compared to this Acura TL. This is the best choice I made!  ","Everything: powerful engine, gas MPG, as solid as rock, smooth and quiet, Honda reliability!",Nothing but six speed tranny would make it even better then it already is!
5,Great  Car/Great Price,BensTL ,10/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Have had the car for about 2 weeks now and so far all I can say is awesome. Had an '04 Infiniti G35 AWD and it rattled like crazy. Then a '07 Lexus ES 350, great car but boring to drive  and expensive with options. The new TL takes the best of both those cars and puts it into one attractive, fun to drive package. The nav. system and sound system are top notch. Fit and finish are great and with only 600 miles on the car I am avg. 20 mpg in the city, not bad for a car with 280 hp. The seats feel good and the steering wheel has a nice feel to it. The kid in me loves the paddle shifters.","Back up camera, sound system, 280 hp, paddle shifters, features for the price.","18"" wheels and tires. Improve headliner material"
5,Super Car with Polarizing Style,True Enthusiast ,10/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The 2009 Acura is Superman with a Robin costume on.  I'm sure there are some who love Robin's outfit but more I'm sure more prefer Supermans outfit.  The styling is too love it or hate it in my opinion.  Besides that Acura got it right.  They really should get rid of the stock wheels as someone as mentioned too.  The upgraded wheels are what should be standard on this car.,"Push start, size, Tech Package",Replace stock wheels with nicer ones on NON SH AWD models.  Redesign the front end.  I hope I get used to mine because I love the rest of the car.
4.75,2009 Acura TL,ms ,10/24/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"I am a fan of Acura cars, having owned a 2003 Acura TL, 2004 TL and 2008 TSX. Overall I found the 2009 TL to be an improvement over the 2004 TL, but there are some little things that I dislike: The soft armrest for your right elbow that slides forward that was present in preceding models is now gone. I miss this.The trunk lid is now higher so you have to lift things higher to put them in the trunk. When accelerating, the engine revs more than the older TLs. What I dislike most is that the steering is too light and feels unnatural. Pros: The interior feels luxurious and upscale. The navi is quicker and the screen sharper and brighter.","Navi system, stereo","Armrest, steering feel, front grill, trunk lid"
4.375,Bold New TL!,PetesTL ,10/21/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"Overall, this car is a great value for all that's included in the price. I like the bold exterior styling that sets it apart from all the other boring ""vanilla"" cars out there. Performance, handling, ride, features and build quality is much improved over the previous generation. Interior is also greatly improved and roomier than before. The nav system and ELS surround system are both top-notch. Fuel economy is also decent: I'm averaging about 20-21 in city driving.",Nav system w/live traffic and doppler radar is incredible! Quiet ride. Quick throttle response. Very good handling and braking for a FWD car. ,"Ventilated seats should be offered. Stock 17"" wheels are too small on this car--so I upgraded to 19"" wheels/tires. "
4,Fast and high-tech,Eli ,10/14/2008,,,4,3,5,5,,4,4,3,4,"Engine is smooth and powerful, but produces some torque steer on the FWD model.  Without the AWD option its easily the best value compared to competitors.  This car is a geek's best friend. The interior is full of innovative technologies such as a nav system that routes around bad weather and automatic climate control that tracks the sun's position in the sky. The stereo is impressive, but the built-in hard drive is limited to playing ripped CDs, no directly loading mp3 files.  The car is very easy to control with electronic steering and downshifting the transmission for engine braking is extremely smooth. But it would be nice if Honda moved to a 6-speed or better to match Toyota.","Engine performance, best of breed navigation system, build quality, stereo, perceived reliability","Six speed transmission, full-size spare tire, ventilated seats, rain-sensing wipers, RWD, cleaner interior design"
5,BEST IN CLASS,TK ,10/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I owned a 1999 Acura TL with Navi and drove that for 120,000 miles.  It was a very good car.  10 years later, Acura does it again.  I had to get used to the front and rear end of the car, but after a couple of weeks I love the design changes.  If you put any other car next to it, other cars just look dated.  The standard wheels that come with the car are my biggest complaint.  This car really deserves the upgraded wheels which cost me an extra 2500 dollars.  I got the ones that are two tone.  There are way too many advanced features that I wont list all of them.  Go to your Acura dealership and check out the tech package.  It simply blows away anything else out there.  I am very happy.","Tech package features, more specifically I love the new audio set up and NAV system, side profile and unique look and POWER","Basic wheels on non SHAWD models belong on a Honda Accord and not a 40K luxury sport sedan.  Acura, stop being stupid and give us the premium wheels and charge us $1000 more.  We are willing to pay for it."
