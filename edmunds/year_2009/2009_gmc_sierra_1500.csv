First, after 2 years the Evap Vent went out covered under warranty, they replaced the vent. I went out again shortly after year 3 after warranty. Had to pay 500.00 for a special kit to be installed. This was a known problem but GMC would not pay. Year 4, the alternator went bad. 480.00 to replace. Now the steering is making a loud groaning noise when turning. Said may be a bushing and could cost a small fortune to fix. So I would never recommend GM to anyone and will never by another.

The transmission sometimes feels like it is going to break apart; there are loud clunking noises quite frequently. It seems like the truck drives differently each and every time that I turn it on.

","ride,power, looks,american made( mine was made in mich.)",level the nose up . i do not like the slight nose down look. i know it was done for gas mlieage. i will be buying a spacer for mine to level it up! 1 and a half inches is all it takes to make a perfect truck.

I did have some issues with the brakes (high spots on rotors and drums) when first purchased but those have been resolved.  The reason why I purchased the truck was to consolidate; traded in a S10 and Nissan Xterra for a 4 door pickup b/c twins were on the way.  This is the first year of the 6 speed auto so it still needs some refinement.  Love the gas mileage but can't wait until they put out a pickup with a smaller diesel engine. Handling and torque are excellent.","The ride is excellent for a truck. Towing, no problem.  Towed 3 people out of snow banks like they were a piece of cotton.  I love the front bench seat with the fold down center console.  ","Go back to disk brakes on the rear. Should put in an overhead console on every model with a place to put sunglasses.

When it was all said and done; the GMC is the truck that stood out above all others.  A combination of its appearance, comfort, features, and just the way the truck felt and drove simply overshadowed the other trucks.

Using the electo/manual shift button, you can chirp the (18"" chrome clad) tires in 2nd gear (it hits quick!).  Just traded a 2008 GMC 5.3 w/4A.  3 reasons why I traded/upgraded so quick: 1) Cloth seats collected lint, 2) Slow (20"" wls) 3)Fantastic trade-in value on the 08. I have no trouble getting 20mpg highway at 75mph.  If you drive it like you stole it, you can't get much worse than 15! Easily 10% better than my 08. The leather seats are great for long trips.  Deep floor mats, nice touch. Added Retrax bed cover, black nerf bars & black wheel well liners for the rear wheels. Looks good with white paint.","The remote start is cool and practical. The 6 speed is why I traded.  The Bluetooth connection is an excellent addition.  The BOSE w/ subwoofer is awesome, although the standard radio is fine. I like the 18"" wheels better.  I would prefer 20""s, just not the style nor penalty on speed and mpg.","The SLT interior, while very pleasing, looses a lot of storage space compared to the standard interior.
