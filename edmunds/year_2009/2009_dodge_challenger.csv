The Challenger beats them all hands down for quality, power, comfort, and performance.  You can drive this car daily as it is extremely livable or save it for weekend jaunts.  I am thrilled every time I get in the car and turn it on.  I get so many compliments on it from total strangers.  This car has a style that will never go out of style.  I'm keeping this car forever and a day.  If you have the cash, I highly recommend you pick one up if at all possible.  It has true collector car value in my opinion.",,

Sometimes the car will start and run and other days it will not. It started this at 36000 miles. After weeks of online info browsing I've come to the conclusion that this issue is rarely resolved correctly at the dealers and is not an issue I can fix myself do the the complicated programming and tools needed to do the job. As for now, I pay a payment for a car that is no where near as reliable as my 2nd car...a 2000 mustang with over 200,000 trouble free miles on it. This is my first dodge product and clearly my last.","Looks and performance, but I have owned late model mustangs that are faster.",remove the keyless go system and win module so the car will start and run dependably like the millions of ford products on the roads today.
4.875,Blue Nostalgia,quickjack ,09/01/2012,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought my B5 blue SRT8 in October, 2010 with a 6-speed manual. I have loved putting each and every mile on it since. The transmission shifts are crisp, the engine pulls like a freight train, and what a glorious sound track. The interior is comfortable and practical but no styling frills here. The well bolstered buckets are comfortable on the longest of trips, and even heated for those cold mornings. The back seat is for children or small adults, but nonetheless comfortable. The trunk offers ample space, with a 60/40 rear seat split. If you buy this car, prepare for attention. Even still, I get people craning their necks to have a look. After 2 years, I still wouldn't trade it for anything.","Thunderous 6.1 V-8, NASA quality 6-speed transmission, Great Brembo brakes, handles very well for a big car, comfortable, awesome stereo","Dump the terrible 1-4 skip shift, stability control system is too intrusive, an in between setting would be nice, no quick release for driver's seat"
4.75,39 years later it was my turn,smart_shopper ,11/11/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"As a child in 1969 I went with my dad when he picked up a new 1970 Dodge Charger. I sat in an orange car that I later learned was a Challenger.I've owned a lot of cars over the years, including a new 1997 Trans AM WS-6, which is a beautiful car until you have to do any engine work. I can say the Challenger is arguably the best new car I've ever owned.It is huge, it's larger and weighs as much as my truck, a 1st gen 5.9L Durango, yet it gets almost 24 MPG on the Interstate. It has many bells & whistles never thought of in 1970, and it's the best looking retro muscle car in my opinion. Due to size and weight, it's not as fast as the smaller Camaro, but to each their own.","The styling and Hemi Orange paint did it for me. The 6 speed manual transmission was icing on the cake. The entire engine is accessible. One of my gripes in working on cars is the people that design them never have to work on them. The Challenger has a huge engine bay, and routine maintenance is fairly easy- just pull off the plastic cover underneath and you can access the oil filter and pan. I've added HD cooling to mine- the SRT2 radiator, a lower temp thermostat and fan control, and an oil cooler w/ thermostat from a Mazda RX-7. The car runs a lot cooler here in the South.","Do away with the skip-shift feature that locks out gears 2-3 under certain conditions, so people like me don't have to bypass it. I realize the skip-shift is more federal intrusiveness into how our cars are made, but maybe someday we can again build great cars in this country that people want to buy and drive (contrary to the Revolutionary War ad, the Challenger is made in Canada).

The nav feature could be a little more user-friendly when trying to find a named business.

I'm not a fan of wagon (huge diameter) wheels. The 18"" wheels were plenty large, and my car came with 20"" wheels.

Rear visibility takes some getting use to. I added a camera over the license plate."

However, at speeds over 100 the challenger handles better is quieter and more responsive then the E 320.  If I had a had to get rid of either car, it would be the Mercedes.  The only thing bad about the challenger is it is not a family car.   The back seat is hard to get into, but it is so much fun though, that the grand kids (ages 7,6,5) do not mind.   My Grand children and I have so much fun, and it tickles them pink when I pick them up after school in my 2009 hemi orange challenger R/T.

I drove both, and just couldn't shake the fact that the Challenger is just a better looking car that provides the perfect blend of retro muscle car thrills. Yes, it won't outhandle or outrun the mustang, but I smile every time I look at it and love listening to the sound of the engine and the smooth ride on my drive home. Navigation and bluetooth phone are much improved. Soft handling that still corners well when pushed. Love this car.  ","Just a very successfully executed tribute to the American muscle car.  Love the manual, the engine sound, the modern conveniences, and the surprisingly good seats.

At full open throttle the exhaust sounds like music to my ears.  ,What I like most is the body this car has one if the best bodies I have seen on a car in decades. The fact that it has a 6.1 hemi under the hood is just the cherry on top.

I'm glad I did. This car is pure power and an eye catcher. I have owned a few sports cars in my day and this is by far my favorite.

I get compliments every time I take it out for a drive, and have had a few impromptu photo shoots in parking lots.  Great acceleration.  The exhaust configuration specific to the RT manual delivers a confident, but not obnoxious exhaust note.  Interior noise is not an issue, even at hwy speeds.  This is not a sports car, so you're not going to corner with a Mustang or Camaro, but you may find it more comfortable for cruising.  After 10k mi, not 1 issue.  Visibility takes getting used to.  Hill start assist and skip shift are easily disabled (most if not all muscle cars have this.)","Incredible torque and acceleration with a comfortable ride, suitable for cross country road trips. Highway mileage is good considering the power.  I get 27 mpg at 65 mph.  Not so good in town, depending on your foot. Great looks and build quality.

5,2009 dodge challenger,Dan ,12/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The only reason I rated the performance a 9 instead of 10 was the manual shifting should not have the skip sifting from 1st to 4th.

Great power, handling, ride, comfort, mileage and looks. It can get 28 mpg if you drive it under seventy and will run up to 140. This car is incredible for long trips. We had a family member go into the hospital 900 miles away and couldn't get any quick flights so took off at night. Got 24 mpg running 84 mph and after my wife fell asleep at midnight averaged 90 to 110mph for 400 miles on I80 and it got 19 mph.","The combination of looks,power,comfort and economy.

I have owned Ford and Chevy products, but Dodge got theirs right! The ride is smooth yet planted, but if you want to get squirrely just mash the accelerator.  As for gas mileage, I typically get 12mpg in city, and 23mpg on the highway.  But I didn't buy this car for it's gas mileage, I bought it for it's retro styling and performance.  A throw back to the 70 Challenger, and Dodge didn't miss a beat with this car.  Also the DriveSRT Experience that is included with purchase of any SRT, WICKED COOL!!  This little perk allowed me to race all the SRT vehicles available in 09!

5,Torred SRT 6spd,tbonesrt ,07/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The fun to drive factor on the SRT is off of the charts. Agressive driving on the streets does not challenge this car in the least. It is quiet at highway speed.  At 75 mph (western States speed limit) It gets better gas mileage than  than most 4 cyl. cars. It doesnt brake a sweat cruising at higher speeds. How many econo boxes can average 25 mpg at over 80 mph and do it all day with no issues. America has been fooled into believing that an econo box that gets 35 mpg on the highway will do that at high speeds. NOT!!!...Love this car.,"Lots of trunk space, very comfortable to drive long distances.  Very quiet on the highway.  Lots of horsepower to play with.  Corners very well.  Handles bumpy roads extremely well. Stops on a dime and gives you change. Outstanding sound system, it will put the ricers to shame.  ",gremlins with sunroof operation. Too quiet on the exhaust note. Too heavy 
4.75,A blast to drive,navyretired ,07/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,This car is a blast to drive. It really makes you feel like a rock star when you drive it. Everybody and I mean everybody loves the look of this car. People just stop and stare.,MyGig and of course the HEMI.,Nothing major really.
4.75,"New School Tech, Classic Muscle",byuchallenger ,07/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I have had this car for half a year or so, and I absolutely adore it! It is a very quick car that has a large aftermarket following to make the car screaming fast. The styling is by far one of the best of any cars out there right now while still being usable. I can fit myself and 3 full sized friends in the car with ease and comfort, something I know isn't possible in the competition. The ride is amazing, seeing as it was fitted with mercedes tuned suspension, and the attention it gets is unmistakable. It's not the fastest car on the road (stock) but there will always be another car that is faster. The looks of this car and the feeling I get is purely unique to the Challenger. ","I love the styling more than just about anything. I'm a young guy who wasn't alive during the original muscle car days, but I surely can appreciate amazing styling when I see it! The 6speed and the 5.7 HEMI (that still gets almost 30 mpg on the freeway as I calculated over a 3000 mile trip) is great","My only wish is that it didn't weigh quite so much. It's great to know I am very safe in the car due to the airbags and safety features, but I wish they didn't add up to a 4000 lb car. "

Since I have owned this car, it has not disappointed me. It accelerates, handles, and brakes like no other car that I have owned.  Its retro shape and Hemi-orange color turn heads every where I go.","Under 5 sec. 0-60 mph acceleration and fantastic retro styling.  Dodge ""hit a home run"" on this car.  The SRT Track Experience and 1-year free Sirus radio are nice bonuses.","The SRT auto. needs a louder exhaust and a fix for the intermittent working key fob.  Also, Dodge should provide a spare tire rather than a tire pump and flat sealant."
5,Feel Like a Celebrity,johndm ,07/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a great car, probably the best I have ever owned.  The car is quiet, runs smooth, gets a lot better gas mileage than I anticipated, and has power to spare.  The most fun is that I feel like a celebrity. I have had this black Challenger R/T for about 4 months. I have met more people who just want to talk about the car.  I constantly get the thumbs up.  The Japanese can't design and make a car like a Challenger with this styling, power and performance, and at a great price. This is American automotive know-how at its best.

4.875,First Muscle Car Owner,Scott Caldwell ,07/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The 2009 Dodge Challenger SRT8 is an absolute BEAST!!!  I was first drawn to the Challenger by its incredible retro- styling.  The broad sholders and intimidating front grill (much different from any other Dodge grill pattern) just made this car stand out and grab your attention.  Although the car looks great, what really sold me on the car was the way it drove.  Once I sat behind the wheel and drove the SRT8 (with the 6 speed manual transmission) I was simply blown away.  The car growled and rumbled with sheer power and accelerated like nothing I have ever driven before.  The 6.1 Hemi with the 6 spd transmission convinced me that I would enjoy the Challenger for years to come.",the 6.1 Hemi and 6 speed transmission sells this car.  The sheer acceleration and growl of the powerful engine is its best feature.  The car's navigation and blue-tooth sync system is also very nice.  Feels like a luxury car more than a rugged Muscle Car inside.,Gas mileage and an additional push to talk button for the bluetooth system on the sterring wheel are the only improvements I can think of for this car.  Gas mileage is hard to improve without sacrificing the power that sells the car in the first place.
5,Close to Perfect,BootCamp ,07/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Saw the Concept car in late 2006. Hadn't bought a new car since 1986 - nothing worth getting excited about - until I saw the Challenger. Ordered my SRT in March, got it in November. It was worth the wait. 6 speed is tight, limited slip 3.92 gearing is great. 425 HP from 370 cu in is better than the original 426 cu to hp ratio. Handles like a car half its weight. The styling is amazing. The Pacifica Studio folks did a great job! Hit the retro look nail on the head in every way! Can't go anywhere without someone wanting to chat about the car - and look under the hood. Huge trunk and back seats - compared to Mustang and Camaro.  The car has been flawless under all conditions. AMAZING RIDE!","The styling, power, Kicker Audio System, fit and finish, GREAT bolstered seats (heated and embossed leather), comfort are ALL great!  Best feature is how retro it looks. It;s like owning a classic '70's Challenger, but without the demand of regular repairs and adjustments. Just start it and GO!","Address the heat-related ""keyless go"" ""fob not detected"" problem.  Change out the rear bushings to help with the ""wheel hop"" issues launching from a standing start on the 6 speeds.  Ditch the 1st to 4th gear skip shift if theres a legal or financial way around it."
4.625,Love my B5 Challenger!,djpatrick35 ,06/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"Over the years, I've owned three Corvettes and while I loved those cars, nothing compares to the Challenger. As a 20-something driving an '07 Corvette, most of the attention I was getting was negative whereas the Challenger gets nothing but positive attention. The car is plenty fast for its size and the interior is large and comfortable. At 6'6"" few cars can fit me, but the Challenger is very comfortable and I can actually fit three people with me - something I couldn't say with a Camaro or Mustang. The shifts are a little long and the skip-shift, while annoying, is something I'm already used to with my Corvette's Tremec 6-Speed. Overall, I love the look, the character, and speed of my SRT.","The looks, bar none. I've wanted a Challenger since I saw the concept in 2006 and the production car looks even better than the concept did. The 6.1 isn't nearly as fast as my old Vettes, but with about 700 pounds more heft, that's expected. The pistol grip is to die for and I LOVE my B5 Blue color.","The Tremec is notchy just like it was in my C6, but hey, that's not Chrysler's fault. It could use some weight loss or power gain and the gas mileage is rightfully atrocious, but other than that, it's a masterpiece! I love my SRT!"
4.25,Fun Car With Glitches,moparfool ,06/11/2009,,,4,5,4,3,,5,5,3,5,"Generally a great car. I have always really liked the late 1960s Dodge B body (Charger) and E body (Challenger) cars. The new Challenger distills the old E body car design without the noise, handling, body flex, and 10 mile per gallon issues of the older muscle cars.  The acceleration and handling are great, IMO. I picked the 5.7 liter R/T as the best compromise on engine power, cost, and gas mileage.  There have been two glitches; at 3500 miles the airbag light came on for a few seconds while cruising. And at 4000 miles the alternator / battery light came on and stayed on until I shut the engine off and restarted. The dealer checked all wiring and found nothing.   ","Hemi Orange color sure gets attention. People love the car and how it looks. Twenty inch wheels look great; nice growl from the exhaust pipes; excellent boulevard and freeway ride. Has a wind noise free and quiet ride, and a great sound system. ",Turn signal indication location is very poor. Getting into the back seat is not for the faint of heart.

I had just got a 2004 Cobra the car of my dreams, or so I thought.  One thing I never really cared for was that Mustangs were so small and had no room for family, they also rode a little ruff after a while, definitly not a dailey driver or for road trips.  We went to the dealership and they had one left, they wanteed 42, but I talked them down to 34, wich is good considering I live in Cali.  My wife was hesitent but after we took it to Oregon to break it in, she fell in love with it.  As much as it weighs, this thing is still fast, and so smooth at the same time.  Such a head turner.","Retro look, I fell like I am driving an old muscle car, interior is awsome and roomy too, most comfortable car I have ever driven.

Acceleration is impressive be it gradual on surface streets after upshift, or stomping it on the freeway entrance.  Slower than the old 426, but does get up and run.  Excellent handling a joy to drive.  Moderate pavement noise.  Hope it doesn't get worse.  This not a young persons car.  First time in my life a vette picked a fight, they NEVER do that.

This car is not about economy, thrift, or ""green"" driving. This car says ""I love to drive!"" The acceleration is heart-thumping, the braking is excellent, the handling is very good and right down to the ""thump"" of the doors, everything is just as a muscle car should be.  The only thing that I wasn't prepared for was the ""rock star"" treatment from people everywhere. People stop their cars beside mine, the give me the thumbs up, I have even had some guys ask me to pop the hood. I have met quite a few good people through this car.

Employee pricing + 0% financing sealed the deal.  Even the wife gave me an okay and my father in law gave thumbs up.  Not middle age crisis, but middle age celebration.  Full Disclosure:  Never had a muscle car as a youth, only two stock 1980s Camaros, so this is filling a void for me - psychoanalyze that.  Teenage son and friends are drooling, and middle aged guys come up to me at the laundry, gas station, parking lot, whatever, asking about it, and it is embarrasing since one wants to be humble.  But in the end, it's an Ego booster.  Chrysler's final mark and legacy if they don't make it.","The sound of the Hemi 370+ HP engine.  The looks one gets.

",it feels solid and quiet when i drive. the fit and trim is first rate. the stereo sounds good. handling is sporty.,i also would have prefered a louder exhaust. perhaps use magnaflow from the factory. i might have liked the lime green paint offered. also an R/T badge on the rear spoiler.

For years I have wished that Dodge would take the body style of a 1970's era Challenger and put in on a modern chassis. This car has the retro styling without the drawbacks. I have the 5.7L Hemi mated to the 6-speed manual. It was the only option I wanted or paid for. That made this car a bargain high-performance car, especially when you factor in the incentives being offered. It is a blast to drive. It has a tight ride without being too stiff. It turns everyone's head. I love it.",The exterior design. The 6-speed manual transmission. The sound of the exhaust. The front bucket seats. The appearance of the gauges.,The Challenger needs driver-side access to the rear seat. It also needs the gauges most performance cars include like oil pressure and voltage. Eliminate the 1-4 skip shift feature.

I ease that clutch and she bites a chunk of pavement and begs for more road to eat up.Second day I had it we went for a 3 hour ride across the state. With 6 gears the motor breathes and sips the gasoline for 22 mpg. On the street people stare at this car like they are watching a magic trick.,"Its got a HEMI and rear wheel drive with a 6 speed tranny,leather heated seats, and it looks every bit as cool a classic muscle car from the 70's. Like a 'cuda with a Mercedes suspension and a Viper drivetrain.I like the fold down seats in the back and the trunk space.",I can not think of anything to improve this car.
4.625,Heart throb car!,Dave ,02/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I knew when I purchased the Challenger SRT8 in Hemi orange that I would get attention but I did not expect so much.  It is a social experiment every time I take this car out. Part of the effect is on me as I feel my juices flow every time I take it out. But the bigger laugh is all the comments, thumbs up, and gawkers everywhere I go. I could have bought a car for six figures and it would not have grabbed so much attention as this Challenger does. I have even had the county sherriff deputies following me in their Charger and scoping out my Challenger.  The best part is that it is as crazy fast as it looks and that Sherriff Charger would not have stood a chance.  ","Exterior styling, coolest seats, Power power, and more power.  And if you really want even more power, some fairly simple aftermarket mods will push this car well over 500HP.",Turn signal indicators are lame and hard to see.

If you want to be noticed and feel like a rock star on a daily basis, get behind the wheel of the Challenger.  I purchased a black 6 speed R/T and do not have one complaint with the car. The seats are more than comfortable, the performance is great and when you can keep your foot out of the floor, the gas mileage isn't bad for a sports car.  Back seat room is good for this type of car too. ","The looks, the 6 speed transmission, the leather seats, and the hidden ESP off feature.","The Challenger needs to have its own steering wheel and dash features. Other than that, nothing!"

The performance on the RT if great. 6 speed manual gives you the ability to drive like it was ment to be driven. I still haven't turned on the radio because I love listening to the car rumble as I drive.,The sound of the exhaust inside and out. Very comfortable. Looks great.,Shifting is a little hard. If you haven't driven a stick in a while you might have problems getting into 1st and 2nd gear. Maybe I just need to break it in. drivers side access to back seat is next to impossible.

My kids are 8 & 11 and they are already fighting over who will get this car when they can drive! I'm kinda thinking they will need to get there own! My daughter said I am not cool enough to drive this car. Maybe not, but I look good and feel good every time I get behind the wheel! I haven't felt this way about a car in a very long time! I don't know were Detroit has been the past 25 years but they finally got something right!","Smoking tires, parking lot fish-tail, stop light rev are all great but these seats are to die for!

4.875,Dream car,Gene ,02/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Ive been watching these since the concept car in 06 (owned Cudas and Challengers as a young man). I finally drove one and left the lot with it. Ive owned Vettes and Saabs and this car blows them away. I can't wait each day to go fire her up. Manual transmission is fantastic. Sometimes forget it has the 6th gear. Very comfortable, smooth ride.  Handles like a dream. With current incentives it made this car more affordable (comes with lifetime drive train warranty). Having owned old style Cudas and Challenger the upgrades done on this modern Challenger are superb. Many people give the thumbs up or stop me to ask questions. This is a keeper.","Manual transmission is fun to drive, very comfortable seats, large trunk, Excellent stereo (7 speaker with subwoofer), many computerized interior features (uconnect is great).  Exhaust has a great sound. HID headlights.",GPS and Uconnect can be confusing until you set them up (then they are an outstanding feature).

A bargain.  I have purchased over 20 cars since 1986, including some expensive German iron, and the Challenger is in a class by itself. You are truly the king of the road in this car. It is more than just a retro design excercise, it is a great car in its own right, and possibly the last of its kind.  If you are thinking about getting one, do yourself and the economy a favor and do it. You won't regret it.","The leather interior with its retro ""tuck and roll"" look is super cool as well as comfortable.

They took the offer and I gave them the check. The style of the car caught my attention, then after a test drive i wanted one. The interior is very comfortable, very nicely done leather seats. The power sunroof is an bonus feature.  The car still gets ton of looks but most importantly it has the look i want, the performance, and makes driving fun.","I love the looks, the leather in the interior is great, the car still has the new smell some 2 months after I got it. The performance is great, i just wish the wheel slip system would kill all the fun, but safety first.

Was considering all the known 40ish suspects - Acura, BMW, Infiniti, etc. but wanted to get something different and more exciting. Saw the Challenger and had to have it. Drove the Charger and liked it but fell hard for the styling and ride of the Challenger.  Love the way it drives - power, control and fun. Have already had several folks follow me to a stoplight or gas station to ask about the car. Lots of thumbs up and nods from other guys with cool car envy.

Long time import owner, never in a million years thought I would be driving a Dodge. Been driving it a couple weeks. Meets or exceeds most expectations. Inspect exterior fit and finish closely prior to buying. Some annoying body panel gaps and misaligned hood. Some materials are a little cheesy but overall package outweighs these minor issues.

4.5,An Ultimate Toy,Scottsman ,12/22/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"Drove my brother's 2008 SRT8 & had to have one. This isn't a car anyone needs, but if you have money to waste, you'll never waste it on anything that's more fun to drive. Because of it's size, weight & Goodyear F1 SuperCar tires, it feels as if it's actually attached to the road. No matter how fast that Hemi propels you, the suspension will control the car & those hugh brakes will stop you. You never feel as though you can lose it, except on as little as 1/4"" of snow. If you must drive in snow, do not buy the F1 tires. Let's face it, if you're one of the ""Green"" people, or one of the ""PC"" crowd, you'll find this car incomprehensible. If you grew up in the 60's, no explanation needed! ","Performance, retro look, comfort, and, the unbelivable attention this car gets.","For what this car costs (and it ain't cheap) you would think it would have rear parking assist sensors, a power passenger seat, ""automatic"" climate control, and, a spare tire!

4.75,FINALLY,Yankee ,12/02/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Oh man, this beast is absolutely awesome! Base non-leather seats are very comfortable and supportive. The pistol-grip 6-speed shifts very well and the clutch isn't heavy at all - the take-up is a little high, but you quickly get used to it. The hill- holder feature comes in handy on hills. The performance of the 5.7 is truly exceptional, and gets noticeably better after 1000 miles. Plan for some extra time at gas stops, as you'll get swarmed by various gawkers and wannabes - this car gets more attention than a Ferrari. The styling is absolutely spot-on, better than the 2006 concept - hard to believe this is the same company that makes the ugly Chrysler Sebring and Jeep Compass. ","Very deep, throaty exhaust note with the 6-speed - if I didn't know any better I'd swear it already has a Borla catback system on it. Very solid overall feeling. It really doesn't feel like it weighs 2 tons. Has all of the best features of the original 70 model (and then some) without the drawbacks.","Gets expensive quickly when you start adding options. Hood prop-rod is cheesy, should have the struts like the SRT model.  Driver's seat should fold forward, but it doesn't. Outside door handles can easily slip through your fingers.

The nav system and sound system are nothing short of amazing to me. The interior is clean and very functional. Only a couple things could be improved in my opinion. Once you get used to it, the blind spots are not a problem whatsoever. There is not much I would change on this car, some very small issues. Driving it is such a pleasure, I look forward to it every day! #1 of all the retro cars","Power, styling, quality of design and manufacture. The MDS engine gives great mileage on the highway.

It is a defintie head turner, I have people stopping me in traffic, at different places I park and want to talk about and how hot it is. Got to say Dodge got it right on this one.

I traded in a Mini Cooper S works car so the first thing I noticed is the roomy interior. A bit more power would be nice, but opted for better mileage.  Handling was a surprise for this size of car. Much better than I expected.  Road noise, what road noise.  Electrics are smooth and quiet. Comfort and driving position superb. Yup, happy I got it...",Style. Period. Both inside and out.

Blows the Infiniti away in every aspect.  ,Love the styling and power.  Better build quality than my old infiniti.  More reliable and gets more looks too.,Better gas mileage.  But I do get on it a lot though.
4.75,Love this car!,DsM ,10/09/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great car for the price. It has very decent acceleration for the size and can handle turns at fairly high speeds. I'm used to driving smaller Japanese cars so this was a change. Going with the 3.5 L helps with gas and the overall look of the car(did not like the silver gas cover or wing on the r/t) I also like that the price is 8k less than the r/t. If you go base model, get the G package because it comes with bigger rims and fog lights. It's only $2000 more. But the overall feel is the best I've felt in a long time and it gets the most looks(even in L.A.).I drive in a lot of traffic so I'm averaging a little under 290 miles to the tank. costs $58 to fill up where I'm At. ","The Sirius radio built in, and the self repair tires. The overall feel of the drive. Plenty of space in the front for being a two door. Almost everything. ","Well if you look into a 08 charger and 09 challenger, they look almost identical in terms of dash, gauges, and panel control locations. Dodge could have changed that up a little. "
4,Who Knows Yet,Al Mumit ,10/04/2008,,,4,5,4,3,,4,4,3,5,"Wife had to have it. I did not object. It drives easy and the ride is surprisingly smooth. There is plenty of power, it doesn't sound obnoxious, and the Boston Acoustics sound system is quite good. This Challenger beats the snot outta the Mustang in all respects. I drove the GT and the Bullit trying to find a comparable ride. The difference is astounding. I own a Toyota Tacoma, and have always been wary of domestic cars as there are thousands of horror stories. In all, this car is a solid winner. Retro/modern done right, if a little pricey. Never had a muscle car before, and now I know what the stink is about! People can't stop looking at it! ","Power, looks, and the wife is tickled. What more can you ask except maybe lower gas prices?","Only had a single problem so far, which was the key sensor transmitter thingy. I still don't love Dodge...but that is starting to change.

I have always had performance cars in my garage, but this one is way better than anything else I ever had.  I looked at the Nissan GTR and the 350Z. The GTR is just plain ugly in person and the dealers are marking them up way more than they are worth.  The 350Z was slow and the few I saw on the lots had trim pieces falling off them already.",Love the styling and the performance.  I get more looks in it than when I had my Acura NSX.
