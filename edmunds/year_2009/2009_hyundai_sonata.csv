5,A pleasant suprise!!,Michael ,08/31/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,"I purchased my 2009 Hyundai Sonata in 2010.  I was a bit hesitant about the purchase but I scored a really good deal and it had a great warrantee.  Looking back, it was one of the best decisions I have made.   I'm currently in the market for a new vehicle because my sonata was involved in a car accident.  But I've put over 70k miles on the car without hardly any mechanical issues. I had an issue with the power steering pump around 40k but that was it.  Besides breaks rotors and fluid changes, I have not had any other mechanical issues with the car. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for a good used car. It was just as dependable in 100 degree weather or 20 below with a foot of snow on the ground.  I hope I am as lucky moving forward to find such a reliable and dependable vehicle.",,

5,I love this car,Allison ,05/24/2016,5,5,4,,,5,5,5,3,,,"I previously owned a Chevy Cavalier. It was a cute, comfy, cheap car, but everything in the world went wrong with it and it was only three years old when I bought it. My 2009 Hyundai Sonata was purchased in 2013. I owned it for three years before it was wrecked in an accident. In those three years I never had to do anything other than oil change, wiper blade change, and new tires--all normal stuff. It ran perfectly and gave me no real trouble. Although it is a little too wide near the sideview mirror level, it is extremely spacious. I could sleep comfortably in the trunk or backseat if needed. It is super reliable. The one time the check engine light came on it turned out my gas cap was off. I love this car. It broke my heart when it was wrecked. But, even in that, it was a good car. A car clipped me while speeding. He was coming down the hill at a good speed and did not even brake. He smacked into the front/side of the car, and the car jerked but did not spin. The front was all smashed, but the damage was only about a foot in, and everything moved about a foot to the left from the side swipe. The rest of the car was fine. I could still drive it the few blocks home. The insurer just considered it a ""total loss"" because the cost of repairing it exceeded the retail value of the car.That is the main drawback. I don't know why, since it is a very good car, but it has very poor resale value (about $7,000 at just 7 years old). I owe more than the car is worth. I would highly recommend this car to anyone--but would recommend bargaining down to the Kelley Blue Book value, which is much less than what most dealers sell it for, to make sure you don't end up with a big gap to cover if the car goes kaput. Or, at least factor in the cost of gap insurance, which is really important if you get this car.",,

4,Like A Best Friend,Anthony ,05/21/2016,4,4,4,,,5,5,4,3,,,"I love Sonatas. This is my second one and it has been great overall! Pros:* This car is a work horse and a good cruiser. * Fuel economy is outstanding! I've gotten 40 mpg on the highway many times, during non-stop driving and doing between 70-75 mph. * The satellite radio is a great option, you can listen to your favorite station anywhere! Otherwise the CD/flash-drive (USB) is another good option. * Other than routine maintenance performed at the dealership, this car is solid.  * Love the stability control!Some cons: * The driver's seat is uncomfortable. It is narrow and lacks support, however, on long trips, you do tend to settle in and forget about it. * The 4 cylinder engine, while effective for, is somewhat under-powered. When the car is loaded for those long, summer trips, or with the a/c running, it can easily lose up to 20hp and you'll notice it when attempting to merge onto a highway. I should have opted for the 6 cylinder version instead. * Tires are very important! Do not go cheap on them and always get the original or better. You will be thankful, especially when it rains as the car tends to lose grip upon accelerating from a stop or going around corners.  * I wish navigation was available when I bought it.",,

Now 2/26/2016 has 55,000 miles and still drives and smells like a new car. Only problems I have had are the rear brakes, which I fixed myself with new calipers and rotors. Got tired of Hyundai denying the design defect and their refusal to fix under bumper to bumper coverage. The car is well designed, tight and as others have written the V-6 and transmission is fast. Pickup is faster than my 2006 Mustang GT. This is  one the nicest cars I have ever owned and I have had Lincolns and Cadillacs. It isn't a plush ride but it is soft for a small car. Staying away from the Dealers and doing maintenance and repairs myself. Doing a brake job takes 30 minutes a wheel and changing the oil is just as fast.  I just refuse to pay the Dealer  $59 to have a $9 Cabin filter (another 15 min.) replaced.AUGUST 2016-UPDATE: Front speakers became intermittant. Always thought there were only two sound systems in the 2009 but found out I have a third..one with an external amplifier in the trunk passenger side wall.It is not an Infinity System. Repair price $275, replacement from Hyundai $550, bought a Rockford Fosgate 4 channel for $200 and cut the old one out . Didnt realize how bad the Hyundai System sounded . Everything working fine now. Car is still performing well although shift patterns sometimes get strange .",,

It's reliability gives me the greatest sense of relief.  For what it is, with its smaller v6, it really likes to show off if you let it. With good summer tires, and traction control off and in sport mode while manually shifting, on takeoff tires are almost garunteed to spin a little, very vocal. You can also get tires to spin in motion if you drop into first under 20 and hit it. No it's not a performance car. But I have beat Mustangs, G35s, TL, Audi A4 & A6, MazdaSpeed3, and many other comparable V6s. Over 4000 rpm you can feel the valves open completely and a small surge in power. The addition of VVT was added in 09 I believe with direct injection. Gas mileage is great for all of this. And runs on regular.",,

Will definitely go Hyundai again.As of 10-28-16, the Sonata now has 123,419 miles, and I won't give it up!  Runs perfectly on it's eight and one half year birthday.   A couple of issues:  First, the dashboard has too much glare in daylight, making it about impossible to see the speedometer with the sun beaming directly into the cockpit.  Second, the dimmer rheostat doesn't dim the dash enough for nighttime driving, and as I work nights, it is a bit bothersome.  Third, something new for this  updated report - some rust on the driver's door, where the door skin folds over to the lower corner closest to the latch, it is crumbling, so it will be interesting to see how severe it becomes.  I do wash and wax the car, regularly and it has not been driven on the salted NY winter roads.  The car is now parked at our second home in Florida, so I am hoping the rust will not progress.  I've also oiled that surface hoping to stop the rusting.",,

It took me days and trial and error at the mechanic to troubleshot the issue. it wasn't the mechanic fault, it was how complicated the issue was, and the code tells more than 8 different possibilities! Now the engine light is back on again but this time is for transmission! it has only 100K miles, and the transmission specialist told me it would be at least $1800 to get it fixed!

At 70000 miles the engine started to fall apart from the inside.  Of course I bought the car knowing that I needed a car that would get me well past the payments, and since I still owe $11,000 + I am more than upset to add over $5000 in engine replacement costs. ",I enjoy the interior and the radio is easy to use.,"My last car was a 1997 Ford Escort and I reluctantly decided to sell it after 250000 + miles. I was hoping to find a car that could match the durability of my Escort (it never had a problem other than regular maintenance, oil changes etc.).

Both cars have needed repairs which I was assured by Hyundai Motors were covered by their bumper to bumper warranties, but which a local dealer, Doral Hyundai, refused to warranty, claiming owner fault rather than factory defect. They are [non-permissible content removed] extraordinaire! It is impossible to get them to fix anything under warranty; they always try to charge the vehicle owner. Hyundai has no way to make a dealer honor the factory warranty, claiming dealers are franchises and they can't make them do anything! Each dealer decides what they will or will not warranty. I had to ""shop"" for a dealer that would honor the warranty.",,"Bumper to Bumper warranty is currently a scam because the manufacturer cannot enforce it.
Each dealership decides what they will or will not warranty, so bumper to bumper is NOT REALLY bumper to bumper, it is actually whatever the individual dealership feels like warrantying.
I will never buy another Hyundai product as long as I live.
Also, if you live in Miami BEWARE OF DORAL HYUNDAI, they rarely fix anything under warranty!
Hyundai can improve their product by insisting franchise owners honor the manufacturer warranty."

I commute 30 miles each way through rainy and sometimes icy Pacific Northwest mountain passes and it is a champ. Great acceleration when I need it, excellent mpg (30 mpg highway), handles very well and it can comfortably seat four large adults. My wife and I took it on a 1,000-mile trip down Highway 1 in Washington and Oregon and it was a fun drive. ","The V^ and I am sorry to hear Hyundai phased it out in newer models of the Sonata. It is a real work horse and gives you the extra acceleration when you need it. I have read some people complaining it is choppy but I have never experienced that. Also love the easy to read dashboard controls, the leather seats that are holding up very well and the very smooth cruise control. I commute pretty far distances and also enjoy the nice radio, CD and XM Radio.","I have not yet figured out the trip counter but that is probably just me. I also don't link the inside trunk opener, which is awkward (I just use the electronic click on my key ring instead). Also the coat hanger design in the back seat could be improved.

I am averaging 26 MPG with city driving and am consistently in the lower 30s MPG with highway driving.  The only problems I have with car are the cruise control (sometimes unresponsive), the paint (flaking away on the hood and the front grill) and the instrument panel lighting which seems to flicker often and cannot be fixed since Hyundai service personnel cannot replicate the problem.","I'm big into simplicity and reliability and, thus far, this car has mastered both with a touch of class and elegance.

I, like many others, have the dash/windshield creaking problem.  This did not fully develop until around one year of ownership.  The noise is present with every movement of the car (light acceleration, braking, undulation) not just over speed bumps or potholes.  Call me OCD but it is so annoying, that I am about to dump the car at a loss. The dealer did try to fix the problem by re-seating the windshield but the noise is even worse after their ""fix"".

The fuel economy has been as expected (I usually average 28 mpg per tank). Although some say its a ""Lexus-like"" ride, I'd say that's a bit of a stretch. The interior (especially the center console) looks great and the amount of standard features really won me over. The 4-cylinder engine does run a bit rough on cold days but usually is docile unless its really pushed. The transmission does tend to upshift quickly on the automatic (I believe in order to give better fuel economy). So far I don't hear any rattles in my car.

Also the engine noise is more than I would expect out a new car. The styling of the exterior is good and the interior is better than some more expensive cars. The ride is stiff and bumpy, the engine noise is more than I would expect from a new car off the showroom floor. The transmission hesitates a bit. The rough road feel through the steering is annoying and tiresome. It's not a Camry or an Accord, but for a price of 25%-35% less its an ok transportation car. ","I do like the dash layout, very similar to a Camry. Nice body style.",They need to improve the ride comfort. The suspension or tightness out what causes the rough ride and bumpy feeling needs to be corrected. The engine noise and vibration needs improvement. A new car should have a smooth quite ride.

I didn't buy a super car so it doesn't get 10's for ""performance"" or ""fun to drive"", etc. I've had this car a little over a year and never regretted it.  I've averaged 26 mpg in mixed driving. It has a nice ride and the handling is fine. Seats are comfortable even on long trips. It has a roomy feel to it too. I put three kids in the back seat and they do fine. Plenty of trunk space too.  I had a squeak in the dash when I went on rough roads that lasted for about a month but then it disappeared. It also gets a little noisier on rough roads but still feels solid.  I have strangers ask me about it in parking lots which I've never had before. ",Roomy and comfortable feel in the drivers seat.,The defrost works fine as long as you keep the fan up to 2 or 3. But then you get fan noise that isn't really loud but it seems unnecessary. When you set the heat for floor/defrost they need to get a little more of the air directed at the window so you can run the fan at a lower speed.

I have driven to Florida twice from Maryland (About 6000 miles) I normally put around 12,000/year in my commute in the DC Metro area. I want the readers to know that I was also hesitant to purchase a Hyundai. I did substantial research and for the price this car is the best deal for the price.  I have had Camry's and Accords and I truly cannot see any difference in the ride and hopefully reliability.  I am 110% satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this car to anyone in the same boat I was in last year.  Another aspect to consider is the 10yr/100,000 power train warranty..I guess I will have this car until at least 2019...

Right off the showroom floor the ride is stiff and I feel every bump in the road. If you run over a penny at any speed you can call it heads or tails from the road feel through the steering. This has been the major disappointment. The first tank of gas I got 29 mpg. There is a slight transmission hesitation on the acceleration.

The transmission adapts to your driving style. The sport-tuned suspension is another big plus. The safety features can't be beat and with pretty much all options is still thousands less than Toyota or Honda. Long term reliability remains to be seen but build quality seems first rate and the car is very roomy both front and rear. The warranty was also a factor in the purchase just hoping I won't have to use it much. Mileage is excellent on the highway (30+) but city is not so great (19-21) but that might be due to my heavy foot. ","Excellent value for the price. Smoothness and power of V6, roominess, standard safety features, XM radio, IPod connectivity, handling of SE suspension",Center armrest needs to be longer. It's pretty much useless where it is now.

I was disappointed with the harsh suspension due to the narrow profile tires it has. You do feel every pot hole. The drivers seat should have more back travel for leg clearance to exit from the car. The arm rest could extend forward a little farther for comfort. The blue trip scan gauge is very hard to read when lights are not used during the day and it is real bright out side. Color should be either orange or green.  Slight hesitation on acceleration is very annoying.,Good value and mpg and safety features for the money spent.  Infinity sound system with the 6 cd changer is excellent. I am going to enjoy the heated seats in the Mn. winter around the corner. Auto trans. shifting is very smooth.

My ONLY gripe thus far is the low tire pressure warning light that comes on intermediately in error.

To give some perspective my old car was a 2007 Taurus so this is an upgrade.  The doors are solid, the ride is quiet and very comfortable and I think it handles great.  I read many reviews on how blah it is but I think it is pretty responsive.  The 6 cyl engine is more than I really need but the drop in fuel economy wasn't that great.  The interior is excellent.

Hyundai really seems to be trying and has put some very nice features into their base model that you have to pay a lot more for in the other brands.

I love all the thoughtful little upgrades which are standard, such as the 3 nozzle window sprayer, the above visor lit vanities lights, and beautiful interior stack. I have been averaging 31 mpg on regular, and honestly, I hardly miss my G35(only off the ramps and when I feel a little crazy), or its 20 mpg with super.

Hyundai engineers failed in ""coordinating"" the transmission gearing and/or final drive and/or cruise control sensor.  Climbing any incline over a couple of degrees at 60 mph or so will surely result in downshift from 5th to 4th (an increase of 900 rpm) when some downshifting is not at all necessary, or only a 5th gear ""shift"" to clutch/slippage (an increase of only 300-400 rpm) in 5th gear would be sufficient -- though still 'busy'.

4.5,Great Review of a Hyundai?!?!,BasicTek ,05/24/2009,,,5,4,4,4,,5,5,4,5,Taking a risk and buying a Hyundai after 11 years of ownership of a Nissan Maxima. There have been many doubts but so far this Hyundai keeps dispelling them. Unlike any other car I've owned this one has prompted me to drive out of the way just for the sheer enjoyment of driving and listening to the amazing stock stereo system. For a mid sized car it comes awfully close to Cadillac in ride quality. If you need to save precious $$$ from a new Camry or Accord I suggest you take gander at this car before making a decision. Hyundai has a chip on its shoulder and it shows as their newer products may not be just closing the gap but jumping ahead instead.,For a stock 80 watt stereo this thing rocks especially with XM/USB features and crisp clear sound. Also I really like the 249 HP engine with shiftronic tranny for fun driving. Finally I'd say the large storage spaces throughout including the huge trunk.,Many people have complained about various noises the car makes in the Hyundai forums. I'd recommend Hyundai does some serious research into this. I've search some rattles come and go and it makes the car seem cheap even though everything else about the car is contrary.

This is our 2nd Hyundai (have a 2007 Santa Fe limited). I paid $13,500 out of the door. You can not buy a new car for this money. Now to the car, great redesigned interior, VERY smooth 4cyl 175hsp engine with a VERY smooth suspension and soft clutch, very quiet ride, no more or less than a Honda Accord (which I also have). There's plenty of room, very comfortable seats, nicely designed dash and center console and beautiful exterior and paint selections. I only wish that the GLS came with the sunroof option and the dual exhaust or that the SE model came in a 5speed transmission. I love it","Smooth, quiet, comfortable, decent options, nice looks (inside and out) keyless entry, ipod and USB cable connection in the center storage, blue and hyper white back lights, soft clutch (about 5-10 lbs when you push), responsive steering (this is not a Porsche), shark fin antenna ","I would just like to see more options on the manual cars (not free, just able to buy)"

My wife is not thrilled with backseat storage and there are only 4 cupholders, 2 in the back seat arm rest, but other than that it is a very nice car. Only 1100 miles so far. The mileage is a little lower than stated, but I do a lot of short hop type of driving, so I can understand that. Also, weather has been cold/chilly which also affects it and I probably haven't gotten past the break-in period. Other than that, I love it. XM 3 month trial is very nice. The sound system and radio are awesome. You have to buy a $30 cable for the IPOD to work correctly, but it's awesome.

It has the option premium package with moon roof, automatic lights, trip computer, electric seat. Got a great deal and now I can see why: this car is fine on the highway and if that is all you basically do then fine,  buy it. But if most of your driving is in town, on any road less than perfect then forget it. It is one constant busy, bumpy, and thunky ride with every imperfection in the road transmitted through the inferior suspension put into this car. After a week of this nonsense I finally had enough and took it back for another car. Fortunately, the dealer allowed me to trade it without penalty. Be warned, this car is terrible on city streets","Moon Roof, interior design, automatic transmission, responsive 4 cyl motor.",Put a decent suspension in this car and you would have a winner.

This will be my final review at a year old.  I'm sorry to say, but I now understand why Hyundai is not considered the same in quality as the leading Japanese manufactures. Not only have I detailed a number of options missing that the competitors offer, but numerous problems have reared their ugly head in the past year.  The 09 Sonata is a nice car, but it's priced right where it should be. After my year experience with the car, I understand why Hyundai does not have the resale value of the Japanese as well. Hyundai has made great strides, but they have a ways to go.","My favorite feature is still the velvety highway ride. That's where the compliments end however. These problems have all surfaced in the first year: very harsh shifting transmission, navigation system freezing up, dash making cracking noises as it expands and contracts with changes in temperature.","In addition to the problems listed above, add these to the list: horrible speaker rattles, various strange & unrefined sounding suspension noises over road imperfections. Too many problems to have in only a year of new car ownership. These problems have me very concerned about long-term reliability."

Though it's over 6 months old, it still brings a smile to my face when I walk out to it.  What it boils down to, is that you can't get a better car for the price.  The standard features beat the competitors in its class hands down, even at a lesser cost.  Comfort, size, safety... all excellent.  Not quite as ""sporty"" as the Accord, but more luxurious... so it's a price I gladly pay.  I tend to have a lead foot, as the saying goes, so my fuel economy suffers... but that aside, I don't feel I get decent MPG.  I've gotten compliments from, literally, everyone who's been in my car.","Warranty!  Of course.

I guess my favorite thing is that it's mine all mine.","""Intelligent"" braking?  Not so much. I'm a very precise driver... when I brake lightly, it's wholly intentional.

I can tell you that based on my experiences, the suspension was meant to be soft.  It's not a flaw, BUT it's something that will not give joy to everyone who drives one.  People used to tighter suspensions..shop elsewhere.  What I do have an issue with is the tires.  They do not absorb bumps very well.  The 17"" wheels are worse than the 16"" on the GLS.  This is not a problem with suspension or shocks.  The Kuhmo tires are harsh and noisy.  Invest in better tires if it's that bad for you.  Also check the tire pressure and make sure they're set as they should.  Over/under inflated tires can make a huge difference in ride.","Interior design is worlds better than my 2007 Ltd.  The 16"" tires absorbs bumps a lot better than my Ltd.  I just checked the mileage and it currently reads 26mpg, which is much better than what I'm getting on my V6 (21mpg).  Also, Sonatas DO get better mileage the longer you drive it.","Steering feel is still numb.  They took power steering to another level.  It nice when you're lazy and don't want to give much effort, but when you're driving 70mph on the highway, you'd like more feedback from the road.  Also, folding side mirrors.

5,Great Car fot the $$$,oceandoc ,01/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Drove the Camry and Altima, the Sonata gives you the most for the dollar by far. For 1-2 grand less the the other cars, you get leather interior, xm radio, moon roof, individual temp controls and excellent interior trim and alloy wheels. Entertainment controls on the steering wheel. Not quite as quick as the Altima off the line, but adequate power (my last car was a turbo)  Huge trunk. The oil filter is on the right way so when change the oil, you won't get an oil bath (surprising how many cars have the oil filter upside down) Smooth ride. I didn't experience any suspension noise going over bumps and highway speeds were just great driving. Dash is well laid out with easy to find controls","All the bells and whistles in the interior for way less money then the other brands. Hyundai has come a LONG way in quality.

This is our 4th Hyundai; 3rd brand new. My wife is driving an 07 Santa Fe; loves it. I had an 03 Elantra GT - LOVED that car, but traded it so my wife could have the SF (cry).  This Sonata is even better than the GT; incredible power, nice interior styling and comfort (partial leather seats are very comfortable and supportive); and I think the standard stereo/CD is very good.  Some call the styling vanilla: I call it Hyundai's Sonata 'Audi' (the last Sonata was trying to be a Jaguar - this one succeeds better!). I also looked at the 09 Mazda6 and Malibu LTZ; chose this one.","PRICE! Power seat comfort; V6 engine torque; clean sharp ext. & int. styling; color (Willow Grey); handling, visibility; storage space galore! power outlets; 17"" alum. 5- spoke wheels; driver ergonomics; quiet interior; stereo (really, it's fine!); my secretary has a Camry; I like this much better! ","Not all radio controls are on the steering wheel (comes on an option package); thicker carpet (this has been true in all my Hyundais); power seat cushion needs a little more up and down adjustment for taller drivers (I found a good position for me at 6'1""); suspension is too stiff over bumpy roads."

I was waiting to update my review until I had driven it in the snow. It did not disappoint me. The traction control & ESC seem to do just what they were designed to do. And the Shift Tronic feature is helpful, so you can use engine braking to slow the vehicle down on slippery roads. This car continues to impress me. Im averaging 32-33 mpg. If I get ""Sporty"" and use the Shift Tronic a lot. I'll drop down to 26-28 mpg. I honestly cant think of anything I don't like about it after 6 mos.",The Ride & Handling are very good. Powerful 4cyl. Shift tronic is great. Love the interior & blue dash lights. XM radio. Good gas mileage.,"The only thing would be standard driving lights.

Car has plenty of power. Great gas mileage. Rides smooth and quiet. Build is superb.

I am very please with the design of the car in and out. I love the amenities. For the price I got my car for I could not pass it down. The car has a very soft ride which I had read about.

My 2009 Sonata Limited ranks among the very best autos(including Mercedes, BMW's, Infinity Q45 etc) that I have driven during the past 40 years. The ride is exceptional smooth, handling secure, road noise non-existent, braking responsive without fade, and highway entrance acceleration terrific! The interior is well appointed,and XM radio stations crisp. In addition, my combined gas mileage is over 26 mph,and, I often approach 31 mph on highway driving.

I was in route to the Honda dealer but I passed by Hyundai and asked for a test drive. I should have kept going.  The mileage is greatly overrated, at least in my view. I have not achieved better than 18-19 MPG. It dos not shift very well and remains in lower gears too long.  The ride quality is equally overstated. I feel every bump and pothole. It is a smooth ride only on well maintained roads. Otherwise the ride is very harsh.  The build quality is not the greatest. I have noticed rattles and noises even on minor bumps. As I said, I should have kept going.      "," The engine is very quiet. The styling is nice, the trunk is large, and features abound.The warranty can't be beat."," I feel the above stated points might be addressed.

Our main criteria were:  1) larger and more comfortable than the SL2 (I'm 6'4""), 2) automatic transmission, 3) 4-cylinder for respectable gas mileage (our weekly commuting is 250+ miles), 4) leather seats, 5) power adjustable driver's and passenger's side mirrors.  After driving a dozen or so cars, I cut my list down to the VW Jetta, Mazda 6, Saturn Aura, Nissan Altima, and the Sonata.  I think I would have been happy with any of these, but when the price was factored in, it became no contest with the Sonata beating them all by $2500-$4500.","Effortless steering, smooth ride, good gas mileage, well-designed instrumentation.",Sunglasses compartment is much too small.

The Sonata was about $4k less at the start, has better quality interior, more HP under the hood, is quieter, and handles better than the Camry.  It is not quite as crisp as the other three, but it is a different drive.  And it is so quiet inside, nicely designed.  So, Toyota, I am now a Hyundai guy. ","Headlights are great, the upgrade with power seat gives a nice interior, shifts fantastic, nice feel when driving, and actually does not handle as bad as some reviews say.  It corners nice, good power and very large and comfortable. ","The road noise on the bumps sounds like the tires are bottoming out.  I don't like that all of the doors unlock when put in park.  That can be turned off, but I wish it was adjustable to just the driver door opens.  And I wish the horn did not have to beep when you activate the security. "

I'm very pleased with this car so far and can see myself fighting with the wife to see who gets to drive on a given day.  The five-speed automatic transmission is great. Drives and shifts smoothly. It will tend to downshift while going uphill at highway speeds, especially with the cruise control on. You have been warned! I suppose that's one of the trade offs for the EPA 32 mpg highway.","XM radio, huge trunk, blue-lit dash, big interior; five-speed automatic, ","I wish the trip and reset buttons for the trip odometer were lit up.

After car warms up transmission shifts very roughly between 1st and 2nd gears and sometimes between 2nd and 3rd. I was told that the transmission was an inter active unit and would soon smooth out after the break in period. The car has over 6000 miles now and nothing has changed since the day I purchase it. Also it emits a foul rubbery smell from the heating or air vents. Smells like air coming out of a tire. If steering is turned to quickly to either lock position car will cut off.

The fact that it was thousands less was just a bonus and it has a warranty that the others won't even attempt to compete with. The car drives very nice and is very comfortable and quiet.

2,Poor Quality,Disapointed ,10/25/08 13:48 PM (PDT),1,3,2,1,3,4,1,1," I purchased the 09 Sonata GLS Manual with the intent to save money, not be inconvenienced every month. During the 8 months I have owned the vehicle it has died multiple times, starting at 1205 miles. The problem was traced to a faulty O2 sensor, but has had a skip and hesitation ever since. When I insisted the issue be solved, the lead mechanic said it was normal and they all do that. At 12000 miles the vehicle was blowing clutch slave cylinders every 2-300 miles, which required removal of the transmission to get to. After the fourth one was replaced and the vehicle being in the shop for an accumulated 58 days, I sought legal help because Hyundai would not return my calls. Can't recommend it","The usb input and XM radio is a nice feature. Having exterior heated mirrors would be nice in the winter, but never got to use them","Front suspension transmits a horrible noise in the car while going over pot holes, fix the skipping of the motor, Correct the speedometer (off by 4mph too high), resolve cold engine rasping of valves, resolve the brake pedal fade to the floor at stop signs, resolve gas tank sloshing sound.",,,

So far the Sonata has given me everything I asked for. driving around Chicago in stop and go I get 23 MPG on the freeways at 75 MPH i get 34 Mpg. Can't complain about that. When you stomp it, it zooms past everybody. I like that feeling of being able to pass quickly. The ride is excellent and road noise is a minimum. Ergonomically everything fits and performs well, and the fit and finish is good. No complaints and wouldn't hesitate to buy another one.

Jetta and Accord drove a little better.  I recommend getting the SE over the limited, the wheels, spoiler and options make it look better then the limited plus getting the Premium Package you end up with almost the same car as the limited but minus a few grand.  I bargained down to 19,800 with premium package so dealers are motivated to sell.  When it came down to it I had to decide between Accord and Sonata and the Accord just didn't have the features and cost more.  Accord handled better but that was not enough to change my mind.  I highly recommend this car to anyone.","Upgraded stereo on SE, USB jack, split leather cloth seats, quiet engine, smooth acceleration, looks of wheels and spoiler on SE vs Limited or GLS",Better feel on the steering and brakes feel soft.

What remains to be seen is if the 2009 Sonata will provide 160k mile problem free performance that my previous owned Camry did.  Getting 25 mpg in city driving and recent trip in Colorado mountain drive 32 mpg.  Better acceleration would be a plus in city driving but this car performs equivalent to a 6 cylinder on the highway.    ,The i-Pod connection is great and the sound system is high quality.  ,"The air conditioning vents are not well positioned and the ability to adjust is poor.

I compared prices. I thought I did a good job. I test drove a couple of Sonatas also. So I should have been happy with the car. However I didn't get to test drive the cars over bumpy roads. This car makes the worst noise over bumps I have ever heard. Every wheel on this car just bangs over almost every bump I hit. I did have the dealer check out the car. They said there wasn't anything wrong. I took one of the service guys out for a ride. I really couldn't demonstrate the noise. The roads in the area are smooth.

The Sonata drove smooth (>Accord, >=Camry) and had the quietest cabin while driving.  Add the std safety features and the Sonata was a no brainer. Some people wrote they didn't care for the 2009's updated body lines, but I have a friend with a 2007 and I like the 2009 much better.  The taller front grill (now chrome), larger, brighter headlights and overall more angular body lines give the 2009 a more aggressive look. I really like the new interior.

It's steering and front end need to be redone. The car  pulls to the left while driving on highways and when hitting even small road cracks has a jarring effect.

It has been absolutely flawless in build quality and reliability.  And just like another reviewer said, the car handles much better than ""professional"" reviews would lead you to believe.

After 6500 miles I am averaging 29 MPG around Huntsville, AL in mixed city/interstate driving. The interior of this car is laid out well. The power seat is great because it allows for small tweaks while driving to maintain driver comfort. The stock radio sounds very good and having the USB port allows me to play MP3s from a flash drive, and XM radio is a big plus too. The A/C cools quickly and has to be turned down a bit, even on hot days.

Only sacrifice is in a bit of road feel handling - the Sonata is equal or better than the Accord in every other way.  Ride is definitely smoother/quieter - a great highway car! Trip computer makes me a more efficient driver - 26 mpg city, 34-35 highway. Great safety features, including stability control, which was a requirement.  Fit/finish, seating and interior space is wonderful, and all the standard equipment makes me feel like I've bought a luxury car.  XM radio is fantastic, nav system is terrific. Styling is generic but classy.  I drove about 5 other cars, but after 3000 miles, no regrets!","Trip computer, XM radio, navigation system, safety equipment, the fact that the car is classified as a large car but still gets great mileage, shiftronic autostick (fun!),the amount of equipment/features included as standard equipment, leather interior.

I'm convinced if they were to take the labels off the cars you could not tell the difference between them. I opted for the Sonata for two reasons; the warranty and the price.  I paid $21,300 for the limited package with mud flaps, moonroof guard, rubber trunk liner and mesh trunk bag. You can't touch a loaded Accord or Camry for that price. Through 5 tanks of gas I've averaged 27, 27, 28, 27 and 27 MPG per tank. After 2,500 miles I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would challenge anyone purchasing a mid-sized sedan to drive the Sonata.  It provides the best overall value. ",Love the stereo! The auto A/C works great and the dual zone a/c is a great feature. The interior is stylish and trim is nicely done. I love the front end. The 4 cyl engine provides me with enough power(I drive the speed limit). The warranty was a big selling point over the other cars I considered.,"The radio contrast is sometimes hard to see, mute button should also pause CD. The trip reset and side view mirror button should be lit at night. Speedo not graduated well 20-40-60-80, it's hard to tell if you are going 70mph and it's off 3mph at 60mph.

Its Nice inside, the seats are supportive and comfortable (so unusual for some reason), and the base model features are just exellent.  My only complaints so far is the lack of Punch (but who needs it in morning traffic) and even when riding the speed limit and 99% highway driving, I can never hit 30 mpg.

But when we noted the small difference in price between the Elantra and the 2009 Sonata after discounts, we decided on the Sonata because of its roominess and stated difference of only one fewer mile per gallon highway. No mistake!  This car is comfortable, quiet, and the most pleasurable car to drive I've ever experienced other than something really high priced.  And even then, the difference is marginal.  And what a surprise to put on 507 miles of around-town driving before dumping in 14.8 gallons of gas when the pump popped.

It would be about 2 or 3 gallons from being full. Dealership is no help in this issue.  However when I can fill it up, Gas mileage has been excellent.

Very smooth ride and pleasing power...no problem moving in and out of traffic.  A six-speed transmission would be smoother but the 5-speed is not jerky and the shift timing is good.

I had the Michaelin tires on the Elantra also ... they stunk & wore out in less than a year ... maybe changing them would also help the ride!  Would have been nice if they threw in some rear splash shields. Great Deal !,"Liked the layout of the dash .. You actually see the clock, all the time, instead of looking through a steering wheel. The steering wheel controls are good also, after getting used to them. The 5-speed tranny is great to hold your speed when you throw it to the right & shift it. I like the control.",Because the rear lights changed. The turn lights are now red instead of amber (confusing from the brake lights) Also; the back up lights have a much smaller clear spot.

I got the 4 cyl limited with Navi and BT and it really has blown me away.  All of the positive things people have written about the velvety ride (but not too soft), power for a 4 cyl, and great gas mileage are dead on.  Interior is very sharp and placement of controls is generally very good.  The interior is spacious and seats are comfortable for a big person (6'1"" - 220 lbs).   More than anything, it's the little things that have impressed me; the air cylinders that open the trunk and hood, the dual layer SW controls and door lock prevention when keys are in the ignition.","Voice recognition Navi system with stereo and IPod integration  (need the $30 Hyundai cable)  is excellent.  The trip computer, especially the mpg display really helps you focus on gas mileage.  The auto dimming mirror with built in homelink is great and doesn't move when buttons are pressed.","A vent for the rear seats would be the one standard feature that I would really like to see, especially since the interior is so big.

I looked at compact cars and quickly discovered they were too small. Then looked at the Accord Camry and Sonata. Found the Accord in cloth uncomfortable and in leather too pricey. The Camry was an excellent ride and very comfortable and decided to shop Sonata against it. I found the Sonata with virtually the same ride, a bit less comfortable with a high level of content and great layout and space. The clincher was the price - a full 5 grand less than Camry. Thought I might have 2nd day remorse, but enjoyed cruising with AC and the XM today.","Sound system with XM radio is fabulous. I don't know how they do it but it sounds better than my G35 with a BOSE 220 watt. Very nice dash layout. Spacious interior and trunk. Good AC. Hoping mileage is as advertised. Oh, and did I mention the price? I paid $16,650 delivered. Take that Toyota.","Power driver's seat might help driver's comfort.

After a ton of searching, I settled on a 2009 Sonata. I've put over 500 miles on it and have loved every second of it. After comparing it to the Accord, Camry, and Malibu, I chose the Sonata because I liked it better, regardless of price (even though price was lower). The cabin is very nice and I do not feel as though I've downgraded from my previous Lexus. My initial estimates have me getting around 29mpg with about 50/50 city/hwy driving. Although some people seem to take issue with the steering/handling of the Sonata, I love it. I drive soft and easy, so the car matches my driving well","Interior is phenomenal, huge trunk, moonroof, XM radio, USB ports, steering wheel audio/cruise controls, instrument panel is very simple with great looks, styling of front grille and headlights, woodgrain accents, premium cloth and VERY comfortable, tons of room even though I'm a big guy at 6'3"". ",Can't think of many things that I don't LOVE about this car. Telescoping steering would be a nice feature to add to the standard list. More color options for the exterior.

Family and I just finished 1800 mile road trip and averaged 31.1 mpg on the way there (A/C on low and cruise set at 73).  Averaged 28.0 mpg on way back (A/C on low and averaging 82mph...I wanted to get home!)  Traded in 2002 Infiniti I35 so I was accustomed to all the amenities; glad to see that Hyundai didn't disappoint.  Got full KBB excellent private party value for trade, $2500 rebate (standard and military), $1000 off after haggling and a free spoiler thrown in.   Gas mileage in town is lower than I'd like but that's to be expected with constant stop and go.  ",Stereo is great and seats are comfortable.

I have been driving a 3.8 V-6 with every conceivable option. This Sonata beats the pants off my old car even though I liked it a lot. Mileage is in the low 30's, pick up is surprisingly quick and quiet. The ride is great, albeit not quite as good as my XG350. It handles very well with a good feel on the road and in traffic. It has enough options to be comfortable and complete.  ","quiet engine, spunky response, cool lighting on dash at night. Could use a tad better radio and sound system.","Full size spare.

5,I love this car.....,LidaRose ,07/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5," I researched and drove other cars for 3 months.  My short list also included the Fusion, Camry and Accord.  I kept going back to this one because I got everything I was looking for without having to buy a package (or not be able to get it at all) not to mention the warranty. The Camry had shifting issues, the Fusion didn't have stability control, the Accord dashboard was ugly and confusing.  I only have 1000 miles on it, but so far it's been an amazing car.  I'm getting 21-22 mpg avg city and hwy combined.  I got the SE auto - had a Taurus and the v6 best fit what I was used to driving.  It has more than enough power for me.  It handles well, shifts so smoothly and looks great too.","Comfort, dashboard controls, colors, handling - a little 'looser' than the Taurus but I got used to it quickly, power of the v6, telescoping wheel, steering wheel controls for the radio, roomy back seat and lots of headroom in front, all the storage nooks and crannies in front.","All are nitpicky but the visors are VERY hard to 'unhook' to use - especially when driving.

Here is my first impression from my first 200 miles:  The good: - great value ( can't beat 14,975$ price) - good interior ( dual color comes with cherry read color) - solid build quality - good fuel economy (200 miles on less than 1/2 tank) - manual tranny is Ok, except the clutch bites too soon  The bad: - very soft suspension and numb steering feel - seat is too soft, no adjustable lumbar support or telescope steering wheel for GLS trim  The Ugly: - SE trim would probably address most of my complaints but Hyundai simply doesn't manufacture SE I-4 despite the fact it is listed even in their brochure.

The Sonata is an exceptional value compared to the Accord and Camry costing 6-7K more.  The fit and finish rival that of Lexus.  Despite reviews to the contrary, the car is actually fun to drive and quite peppy even with the 4cyl.  The night display is phenomenal with the blue and white lights.  The surprise bonus - high gas mileage.  I actually got more than 35 miles per gallon on the highway but going little over 60 and keeping a steady foot.

The Accord was not as quiet as the Sonata at 35- 45mph especially, had a slight blind spot in mirror, did not include alarm, had less trunk space, lacked split rear fold back seats (single), but did have superior steering.  Camry did not have standard ESC, the clock was in a strange location on dash (look up!), and the body lines on car were bland. At 1900 miles, the Sonata drives well and very quiet, has enough pick up, mileage at 31-32 (mix highway/local), love the XM radio and ipod dock,great trunk /rear seat space  ","Love the quiet ride, smooth ride with decent suspension, mileage is great (over 32 highway, added sun roof is nice, XM radio a big plus, dash design is great, car interior is roomy and you have good visibility when driving",Steering could be a bit tighter but as long as you are not going to race - it should be perfectly adequate

While the '08 models sharp exterior styling initially caught my eye, the only 4 cylinder models in stock were '09s. The spacious updated interior truly feels classy and the 'fake' manual mode let's you play a little. Acceleration is lacking and gear changes clunky, yet justified by your last refueling receipt. Great gauges and wood trim throughout. Upholstery is bland but practical. Although innovative, integrated USB/AUX ports suffer from compatibility issues (ie. iPhone support). Overall, best value for the money, if you can live with a goofy 'H' on your grill.","Exterior styling, fuel economy, cabin size, warranty.

I had my mind made on Powder White Pearl with Coco(charcoal gray) interior and a 4 cyl. however this was a color combination that was next to impossible to find.

There was a $1,000 rebate on the car which was icing on the cake, because it's already under priced in my opinion for what Hyundai is giving you.  I haven't owned the car long enough to discuss reliability, but Hyundai has come a long way in the past 25 years and I'm sure it will last me a long time with regular maintenance.  What an amazing vehicle! Perfect interior ergonomics, extremely quiet even at 80 MPH, very fuel efficient for a V6, and very fun to drive!  The 2009 Sonata refresh is a home run!  ","Auto open/close moonroof, auto on/off headlights, incredible Infinity sound system with MP3 and AUX port, 2 stage heated seats & mirrors, stability & traction control, auto dimming rear view mirror, enormous trunk, tight turning radius, lots of head & legroom space for front & rear seat passengers.","Not many really, but a few come to mind.  Both front windows should be one touch up/down, not just the drivers window. Also there should be rear door pockets, only the front doors get the pockets. The drivers seat is the only one with power, make the passenger seat powered as well. That's it!"

4.125,New Navigation System,Bob ,04/25/2008,,,3,5,4,4,,4,4,5,4,"Although the newly released 2009 Sonata offers a new navigational system with nice features, it may have been released prematurely. Typically I drive approximately 42,000 miles annually along the east coast. I rely heavily on construction and accident location information. The navigation system offers a detour selection allowing you to plan a detour at various distances. After several days with no answers from the dealership or Hyundai Corporation, and many hours on the phone doing refreshes to the XM NAVTraffic downloads, the answer that finally arrived was that Hyundai did not release the NAVTraffic capability in the 2009 model. Release is expected sometime next year. What a bummer!  ",Gas mileage.,Stabilization when rounding corners feels insecure (weight shifting) even though the Sonata has the ESC feature.

4.625,"Great Car, Great Value",Clark ,04/25/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,5,4,"I never thought that I would buy a Hyundai. I spent six weeks looking for a 5-door econobox to get better mileage on my long commute. I looked at the Honda Fit, Pontiac Vibe, Toyota Matrix, Mazda 3, etc.  I wanted a small car that would carry cargo. So why would I end up with a sedan. I bought the Sonata because it was a great car and a great value. It also gets great mileage (38 mpg on the Interstate at 60 mph). I wanted the four-cylinder to get better mileage. What I didnt expect was great performance. I also didnt expect to have a luxury car with almost all the options I could think of for such a low price. If you buy a Sonata, you'll be happy  guaranteed (10 years/100000 miles happy).","Dual zone AC, trip computer, 6-CD, XM, 7-speaker (with subwoofer) sound system, power heated leather seats, alloy wheels, moon roof, electro- chromic rearview mirror, home-link remote controls, electronic compass, etc. If the navigation system was available when I got my car, I would have that too.","The steering could be tighter. The trip computer switches should be on the steering wheel, not the dash. The mute switch should act as a pause for CDs (nobody does that). The instructions in the manual for the iPod seemed confusing and scary, so I havent tried it. Backup sensors would be useful."

4.375,Sonata issue with IPOD player,Pat  ,04/16/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,4,5,4,4,"Overall the car seems to be an excellent value.  My only concern and something Hyundai doesn't seem to be able to resolve is the IPOD port.  I have connected 3 different IPODs in and none worked.  The only music that played was some MP3 songs no Itunes.  I went to my local dealer who couldn't resole the issue I contacted Hyundai directly and the response I got was to go to another dealer to have them look at it, even though that dealer is over 50 miles away.  So still no answer to why the IPOD port doesn't work.",,

4.875,Hyundai Rocks,CHIFLYGUY ,04/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Excellent car so far. Extremely smooth ride, transmission, and very responsive 4.25 mpg city so far.  Soaks up bumps very well here in Chicago (city of potholes). Seats very comfortable and gives the driver good driving position.  Has everything I want except bluetooth.  Love the new interior that feels like a Lexus.  If you are looking for Accord/ Camry you must look at this car as well.  I believe it is just a better car plus its thousands less with hell of a warranty.",,Bluetooth

4.625,Money Well Spent,mausman ,04/12/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I just took delivery and am pleased thus far.  The interior upgrades (esp. The dash) are vastly improved.  Getting about 29 mpg so far.  I personally wouldn't spend the monies on the v6 as the upgraded motor has plenty and the throttle response is 'right there' when giving it gas.  Also why we bought is the increased seat width and more spacious cabin.  We were looking at a 06-07 Nissan altima, but found the 4 cylinder to be noisy when shifting through gears.  Plus the altima is priced 5-6k more.  The fit and finish is tight and the ride is very quiet and smooth!  Only thing missing is the tight steering response.  I'll write more when I can get it away from my wife and finally drive it!","Interior, xm radio, good power out of four cylinder, nice wide seats and adequate interior, smooth ride","Sloppy steering, steel wheels/rims"

4.875,Best Bargain among mid-priced sedans,BigJim ,04/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Never pictured myself in a Hyundai (I own 2 hondas), but on-line research suggested a test drive was in order.  I tried the sonata in '08 and '09 4 and 6 cylinder limited editions.  Didn't care for the interior design of the '08 console, but the '09 has European luxury styling outside and Lexus-like feature inside.  I planned to buy a 4 cylinder for mileage, but fell in love with the power of the new 6 cylinder.  Lots of Nice features, and first rate build quality.  The limited is a lot of car for the price of a stripped down model elsewhere! Never even made it to Honda or Toyota-- the best a Camry or accord could have done would have meant matching the sonata's quality for at least $7k more",PHENOMENAL value for the money!!! Exterior profile sometimes mistaken for a BMW.  V-6 peppy but reasonably frugal on highway Shiftronic paddle fun to use Auto-off headlights Headrest adjusts front to back and shoulder harness attachment adjusts vertically Good build quality-- no defects on my car,"Make the trunk open with the key, not just the remote fob or inside latch. Appears to be a small blind spot to driver's left rear if headrest is all the way up."

4.5,Overall... Impressed,Hyundai NJ ,04/07/2008,,,5,4,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"DRIVING: The most obvious difference in the 2009 is the tighter suspension system, which can take off-ramps at 50-60 mph without feeling like the car is going to roll. I also own a Mercedes-Benz and can say that this Hyundai's suspension is remarkably comparable (never thought I would say that). Also, the transmission shifts much smoother than the earlier edition. There's also a more robust engine which delivers oomph when you touch the pedal. Cabin noise has been reduced substantially, as compared with earlier. INTERIOR: They finally got the interior right! It looks like, and may very well be, a high end car now! Color combination in the Camel interior is beautiful. Dash is remarkable!","Hyundai has finally upgraded the dash board to a modern foreign car look with high-quality materials and well-though out ergonomics. The dash lighting is a spaceship blue which looks very cool. Stereo is simply awesome! Stereo comes complete with XM satellite radio, MP3/USB input, 6 disc changer.","Exterior needs something. Hyundai should rethink the grill - looks a bit too conservative. Same with the new Azera-like wheels. Also, nix the chrome panel bumpers along the side of the car. Also, Hyundai should think about firming up the seats."

4.75,Beautiful inside & out!,seximobile ,03/28/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"The redesign is a lot more fluid and curvy than last years box. I test drove last year's 08 sonata and it only had ok power. The upgrade on the new four-cylinder feels like there is more power off the line and highway passing. If I lived in hilly terrain, I would purchase the v6 but when I climb hills, I use the shiftronic and it goes just fine. Exterior is beautiful and Pearl White is stunning. Could go without steel wheels, but the covers have a Nice design. Interior is very Nice with high quality cloths and plastics. Good stereo.","Pearl White paint, increased power over 2008, new fluid styling, none on the road.","Do away with steel wheels, this is no Elantra."
