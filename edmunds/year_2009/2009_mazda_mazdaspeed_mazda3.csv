5,Great car for the Price.,Wayne ,09/19/2016,5,4,5,,,4,5,4,3,,,"This really is a great performing car. Its still surprise me what is can do. Its ultra stable on a open highway and loves to be pushed hard in turns. Reliability has been really good. But it needs a little more maintenance than your average car.  I have replaced all the shocks with better aftermarket ones since the shocks when bad around 60K. Upgraded the sway bars front and rear, the linkages are know to go bad. Also make sure you change the transmission fluid every 40K since transmission can go bad on higher millage cars. Besides that there have been no major issues.  If you want a car that is great fun, low repair cost and space for small kids can't go wrong with the speed3.",,

This car made me say ""Holy cr@p!"" more than any of the others. The Speed3 was an upgrade from my 2005 Pontiac GTO which was incredibly fast, but lacked cornering, braking, space, utility, and was extremely expensive to own. The Mazda is a much more complete performance car. After 36,000 miles it's still capable of shocking the bejeezus out of me with its acceleration, cornering, and braking. I've had no quality issues, rattles, squeaks. etc. We take this car on long trips instead of my wife's Maxima because it's more comfortable. I love this car!","Acceleration, handling, brakes, interior materials, audio system. I'm very happy I chose a new '09 instead the 2010's which were also available. The '09 is more than 200 lbs. lighter, it has a more attractive interior, and it lacks the boy racer hood scoop and ""smiley face"" grill. It's amazing how much stuff will fit in this car with the rear seats down. With them up my 6'2"" brother has been comfortable on 250 mile drives. ","It could use an additional power port and it would be nice to have the ""aux"" jack on the front of the audio panel instead of inside the console. "

Take it in, I'm told Mazda knows about it but there's no fix. Take it in a second time, they basically ignore me. There are tons of rattles and squeaks that start to develop, though most will go away if you squirt some WD40 on it or shove some foam somewhere to create pressure to stop the rattling (like the steering column). It's still a fun car and definitely worth the money. There are some things that I do love about it, but I'm going to move on since this car isn't exactly great for stop and go traffic that I'm typically stuck in. (Didn't have a commute when I bought it.)","Turbo (when it works), exhaust tune, steering and handling, responsive brakes, easy gearing and shifting, excellent feel in sharp corners (just be sure to turn off the traction control or it gets weird), fairly decent gas mileage. 

Forgiving engine in the odd times you don't pay attention to what gear you're in starting from a dead stop. I've probably only stalled half a dozen times in the two years I've had it. The transmission is smooth (though rare times it feels like the gears aren't quite synced but remedies itself by the next start of the engine). ","Have an intermittent wiper mode. There's the auto-wipers but living in Seattle, I don't need my windshield wipers to go superhyperomgsofast when it's only misting outside. I hate not being able to control the speed. And if you leave them in auto mode and ice developed on your windshield overnight? Say goodbye to those wiper blades as they glaze over your windshield. 

Also something to reduce the torque when there's snow and ice would be nice. Or move power to the wheel that's gripping or something. Even with studless snow tires, I've lost traction way too many times doing almost nothing.

And uh, fix the turbo issue? "

Interior is nicely laid out, but slightly less features than the 2010 model (dual AC you can get on the newer ones). Seats are comfortable and the ride is a little aggressive, but so what?

The speed3 is without a doubt the best car I have ever driven or owned. It has incredible acceleration performance with concomitant handling/braking/steering. It is a very exhilarating experience to drive though it is easy to break most speed laws. It does NOT want to go slow. It is very comfortably solid cruising at very high speeds. Most passenger just smile with an occasional ooh or ahh as they get plastered to the seat back with the force of acceleration.  I bought a Valentine radar/laser detector to help me not get caught when I occasionally have a lapse of attention to my actual speed.,The predominant feature is the breath taking acceleration. Next is the truly excellent handling on curves. The quick and precise steering lends to the feeling of control when hard cornering is in process.  The drivers accommodations are excellent and comfortable. The seats are exceptional!,It would be difficult to improve on this auto for the price.  I would like to see somewhat stiffer suspension that would reduce the body role feeling when cornering at high speeds.
