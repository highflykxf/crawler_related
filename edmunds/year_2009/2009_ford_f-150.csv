4,Love my f150,Danny ,06/15/2016,5,5,4,,,5,5,4,4,,,I will always be back for an f150.  My truck has been phenomenal for 7 years and has held value so well.  I do all my own maintenance.  The processes are simple and fairly easy to perform for the regular maintenance schedule.  Parts are not expensive and the oem parts last as they should.,,
3,Just an average truck,don butner ,04/20/2016,3,3,3,,,3,3,3,4,,,In 7 years I have used this truck as a car.  I've had a major problem which required replacing the front steering unit.  The heater/air blower unit had to be replaced.,,
5,Dependable Smooth Tough,Josh K ,01/26/2016,4,5,4,,,5,5,4,5,,,"I purchased my 2009 FX4 SuperCrew in 2012 with 49,000 miles on the odometer.  It is now 2016 and my truck now has over 195,000 on it.  I drive this truck A LOT, as you can see.  This is the first time writing a review for a vehicle I've owned, but I felt that I had to share my experience with perspective buyers. I have changed the oil exclusively with Ford Motor Craft oil and filters based off of the dash computer oil life calculator.  I have done all scheduled service either myself or at the dealer. This truck has never let me down.  Aside from oil changes and brakes, I have replaced both front upper control arms, front hub actuators, spark plugs, and serviced the rear diff, transfer case, engine coolant, and replaced the tires and battery. In 150,000 miles, I would say that is very minimal maintenance, and I couldn't ask for anything more. My fuel mileage has been consistent since the day I bought it.  My transmission shifts smooth, 4x4 engages easy smoothly, and the ride is still smooth, quiet and comfortable.I am updating this now with over 216,000 miles on the odometer, and still no issues with this truck.  I am very pleased with the reliability and quality of this truck.If you are looking for a reliable, comfortable and capable truck, the 2009/2010 F150 with 5.4 v8 is the truck for you.",,

It has sat outside for the past 6.5 years, and the paint has not faded or chipped. It is best to have heavy duty truck brakes installed ASAP because the truck is heavy and normal Ford brakes just don't handle stopping well. At first I did not like the 6.5 bed, but after hauling a ton of stuff, it as worked out except for easy parking. I got the overall chrome package and I am still getting admiring comments, ""awesome looking truck, wow what a pretty truck, etc.""  The plastic chrome on the door handles and rims will crack and peel. I am running American 5 spoke chrome wheels, no problems. So far, this truck has done extremely well. I usually buy a new Ford Truck every 4 years, I just got another four year extended warranty on this truck so I guess I am keeping it a while longer.",,

I did have a problem with water coming in the cab through the windshield the 1st year that was promptly fixed, and the a/c clutch went out and was fixed under warranty as well. Other than that it's been a great truck. I tow a 7000 lb travel travel trailer around Alaska and northern BC and it handles towing up incredibly steep and long grades coming up mountain passes from the coast easily. It also handles the 700 km gravel surface Dempster highway going up to the arctic ocean just as well as it does starting and driving in temperatures of -40 or colder.

Well the 2009 F-150 is the truck for you. Just pick a good rainy day to take you pup for a ride, squirt some soap on the roof, and drive into the storm. Your cab transforms into a doggy bath with sprayers installed above the front and rear windshields and back corners of the roof. Open the doors after to drain water. Then crank the heat for a fast dry time.",Do you have a 2009 F-150 missing its Ford emblem? No Problem! Ford emblems are removable. They practically fall into your hands when you touch them. They want you to take them. Never pay for a replacement Ford emblem again.

Ford's trucks should not allow rain in the vehicle only after 40K miles.

This is my first ford truck, and it won't be my last. Very comfortable, reliable, and tastful interior. It functions great in regular truck duties, and as a family hauler. I found a dealership that sold for $100 over invoice, so I ended up getting this truck for almost $7000 under sticker. Gas mileage is, however, dismal. I don't have a heavy foot, but do drive in traffic daily. I average about 15mpg.","Favorite features..all of them.

Only problem is, I recently had a chance to drive 2 of Ford's new 2011 F150 engines. first was a 5.0 powered Lariat 4x4 with a 3.55 rear. Versus my 5.4 and 3.73 combo, this truck steadily outpaced mine. Torque happy down low for being just 5.0 liters, yet loves to rev and run on the highway. Next was a 4x4 FX-4 with ecoboost 3.5 and 3.73 rear, supercrew 5.5 bed, WOW! Fast! NOT FAIR! Now i will admit the ol' 5.4 seems a lil tepid, after driving these two beasts. Very refined sounding, 5.0 sounds sexy!! I still love my 5.4 powered 2009, but ...","I just put in an order for a 2011 5.0 powered supercrew 6.5 foot bed fx-4 with 3.73 rear.

My cousin is buying my 09.","Why couldn't Ford have been 2 yrs earlier with these engines? I do have to say, this 09 is AWESOME! With 50k on it, still feels brand new. Not one hiccup.

This is mostly thanks to my truck having the updated 4.6L 16V with the 6 speed transmission.  This truck is Lexus quite too.  Only sound is the exhaust which sounds like a quite version of the old glass packs (very sweet).  Only problem I've had with this truck is any time I have an electronic device in the truck (cell phone, GPS, MP3 player etc) the tire pressure monitor goes off.  Dealership recommends I not us electronic devices?  Other than that truck seem very tough and reliable.  Easy to park due to turning circle.  Highly recommended if your looking for a truck.","Quite ride, great stock exhaust note, gas mileage, rubber floor, 6.5' bed, turning radius, dash design & looks.","Tire pressure monitors that are more resistant to interference, smoother transmission & standard spray- in bed liner."

Would prefer quicker steering ratio. Unable to get DRL's so leave headlights on all the time. No problems so far. No excessive oil consumption; mpg normally around 16-17 but only 6-8 w/ that trailer. Tow/haul feature works great. Miss having locking fuel filler. Beautiful truck. Cooled front seats are a nice extra. Might be nice to have a grab handle on driver's side A-pillar. Love our truck. ,"Comfortable captain's chairs; Ford's Nav/sync system w/ Sony radio; trailer brake controller & sway controller; tailgate step; roomy cabin; beautiful interior; solid body and quiet, smooth ride; prefer appearance of '08's tailgate & taillights to this '09","Add DRL option; give front doors a solid thunk sound when closing just like the rear ones have; add A-pillar grab handle for driver; design stack controls better such that driver doesn't have to study them to operate HVAC, sound, & Nav systems (I have to look away from road too long to do it.)"

I tow a 30ft travel trailer that weight 9000 lbs and to my surprise i was able to tow with no problems upstate NY.  One thing i did add was rear air bags in the suspension so it would sit so much with the weight of the camper. I also tow the camper on the beach and still haven't had any problems.  There is a lot of room inside the truck also and i cant go anywhere with out someone complementing me on the truck ,The room in the cabin and the power.  ,The turning radius is horrible and when i am towing if i am going up a hill and he truck downshifts unless i let of off the gas right before it shifts the tranny slams into place which kind of scares me.

Just so I did not feel crazy I went to the dealer ship and drove the 5.4 eng , It feels much better. paid 29k for the truck and wanted to trade it in with only 2,300 and all they would give me is 23k. Should have tested drove the truck over night , mad at ford right now, Still going to trade for 5.4L down the road",,needs to come with 20inch stock rims
5,"Yep, It's THE Truck!",Car Guy ,11/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This was my first full size truck, I hadn't thought about a truck, but I upgraded my travel trailer last year and it was all my Explorer wanted to handle. Now with 15,000 miles on the truck I have been very impressed with all aspects of the vehicle.  Controls, interior layout, seat comfort, mileage...I could go on - Mileage for mixed driving always around 18 and hwy over 21, even with the 5.4 liter.  I was amazed with a stretch last summer pulling a 6,200# trailer and still about 14mpg.  I was also surprised that this truck actually has the lowest total cost of ownership vs the other full sized on the market.  If you are looking for a truck, drive this - you'll probably own one too!","SYNC, trailer brake controller, trailer sway control, GINORMOUS back seat! Handling, seat comfort, see notes above.  Really is a lot to this truck.","Wheel packages, standard wheel isn't much to look at. Otherwise, not much you can do to top the best."
4.5,Excellent Truck,Jay in Dallas ,11/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,2,5,"I traded in my 2006 F-150 Lariat 4X2 for this 2009 Lariat 4X4.  After about 2000 miles, I love the new truck.  It handles very well for its size.  Plenty of power.  Fit and finish are excellent.  The only thing I don't like is the shifting of the automatic - a bit unpredictable.  My old F-150 had the 4-speed auto while this one is the 6-speed auto - very different.  My 2006 had zero defects and I'm expecting the same from this one.","Power from the 5.4L, handling, 20"" wheels, navigation","Transmission's shifting habits, automatic headlights tend to toggle on and off a lot."

4.75,Best Ford Truck Yet,Agent86 ,09/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"This is my 8th Ford truck and 4th F-150.  Although it is the lower-end STX, I find it more comfortable than my previous 2005 Lariat.  The seats are more comfortable (although I have to agree that the headrests need to be less intrusive).  The transmission is better matched to the engine's needs and thus the 3V 4.6L feels more powerful than my previous 5.4L.  I didn't think I would ever drive a truck more comfortable on the highway than my Lariat, I was wrong.  Smooth is the only way I can describe this truck.  A nice feature of my particular truck is that it has the carpet delete option so I don't have to worry about mud and snow messing up the carpet.  I just wash it out.","My favorite features are the SYNC system and the satellite radio.  I am on the road a great deal and they make the trip less fatiguing.  I also like the great amount of storage throughout the interior, particularly the extra storage under the middle front seat.  Also, lots of cup holders.    ","If I could fix one thing, it would be the head rests.  I am 5'7"" and the head rest in it's lowest position almost forces my head forward.  I raised it all the way and it fixed that problem but now is in my field of view when I look behind me.  I can live with it but I don't like it."
5,Best Truck I've been in,Scott ,09/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I never expected such an all around excellent performer.  This truck is very comfortable, quiet and very capable in every way.  One reason I picked it over the Toyota Tundra is the large gas tank, 36 gallons vs 26 gallons.  The extra capacity is very helpful when I'm towing.  Other great towing features are the integrated brake controller, and sway control.","Back-up camera, and distance sensor.  Navigation, and sound system are first rate.  ","None at this point.

I am very happy I decided to go with new.  I have been getting between 18-19 with the 373 limited slip rear end.  Most of used trucks I looked at were beat up or they wanted almost new price.  I got mine for invoice.  Been very happy with truck so far.  The  transmission and fit and finish I feel are quite nice for the price and it is a quiet solid truck. ,"Transmission, Sync, Leather",Do have to jump on the headrest wagon not being comfortable.

Got the 5.4 engine as I got a great deal on an advertised package, and the mileage only 1 mpg less.  Getting about 14 mpg in the city, about the same as my old 97 f150 4.7 v- 8.  I noticed in consumer reports, they mentioned the truck engine to be a little loud, and the ride a little rough.  Wow, I would have to disagree.  This engine and tranny is silky smooth and quiet, everyone comments on that who has been in the truck.  I test drove some other trucks, but this one really feels luxurious.","Overall comfort and ride.  Really comfortable seats except for the silly headrests.  The sync electronics better that the system in my wifes new lexus, can access  phone info, ipod playlists, no problems.","The headrest is just plain bad,Your head is always pointed forward a bit, if it was just a little less pronounce, it wouldn't be a problem.  Removing the headreast or reversing them didn't solve the problem for me.  Also, the old ford ignition position was better, wimpy stock tire size."
5,Love me some Ford Truck,Mark ,08/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I laughed when I read that another guy's wife sounded off about buying American.  My wife did too as I was considering the Tundra or Tacoma but never got to the dealer.  I did test drive Dodge, GMC and Ford.  In every category from deal to doors I like the Ford at least a little better.  GMC was a strong consideration and felt more refined but I wasn't looking for refined.  I was looking for some big & bad truck and I found it in my black XLT 4X4.","Tall stance, big chrome, built Ford tough mojo and it drives great.

Paid $54 for  service at an A/C shop in Conroe and it was only low on freon! You'd think Ford would be willing to warranty $54 to keep a customer.  Calls to Ford support were replied with - sorry the dealer says it is normal. So here it is.  Nice truck and you'll like it unless you need A/C, or unless you need to use the warranty!  GM please stay in business.  Anyone want a new Platinum 150? LOL","Awesome Music, Sync.

4.875,Former GM Guy loves his Ford,Tim M ,07/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've always owned GM vehicles, but the new F150 Platinum outshines anything else on the market.  It runs great, gets better gas mileage than my old GMC and I get nothing but compliments on it.  When I get out of it, random people always ask if they can have a look inside.  The Platinum is the nicest truck I've ever seen or owned and yet still very functional.  The power running boards are the feature that gets the most ""wow"" factor.  I would not hesitate buying this truck again.  The exterior looks great and the interior is as comfortable as any luxury sedan out there.  I love my Ford F-150 Platinum.","- Power Running Boards - Microsoft Sync - I stream Pandora via Bluetooth from my Blackberry through the stereo and it sounds great. - 20"" rims - they just look sweet. - Comfortable Air Conditioned Seats - no more sweaty back side. - Decent Fuel Economy for a big truck - Rear View Camera",The head liner was attached with velcro and has since dropped around the moon roof.  Ford has a fix for it that uses a clipping system.  This is a common problem in the F150's with the moon roof.
4.875,Best Truck Out There,Nick ,07/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"It took me 1 year, researching the Internet and 50 test drives of every truck out on the market to make my decision but I chose the 2009 Ford F150 FX4 for my family.  Interior was by far the best and back seats were very roomy.  This is the truck to buy  Here are my takes on the rest of the trucks  Dodge Ram Hemi 4X4 Crew- Interior still looks cheap and Hemi makes a whole lot of sound and no go.  Toyota Tundra 5.7 4X4 Crew- Very fast truck but interior was off key and frame not as strong as the domestic three.  Nissan Titan 4X4 Crew- Decent truck but mpg was the lowest and the ride was jittery.  Chevy/GMC Trucks 4X4 Crew- Back seats where for children only and interior was cheap.","Back Seats, very comfortable and roomy.  Not much has put this truck apart from the rest except that this truck is well put together and all of its features are easy to use.  It is just a well thought out (listening to its customers) truck.","The only thing I would improve is the motor.  Once this truck has the new 5.0 V8 and the EcoBoost 3.5 V6 both producing 400 horsepower and 400 lbs of torque, this truck will be start stealing market share."

Loved the look of the truck but the back drivers window squeeked going up and down. The drivers door grinded opening and closing and the volume button came off, all in a matter of 3 days. I cant imagine what else would go wrong with it in time. The Chevrolet looked good, but the truck is nowhere near as big in the inside as it looks on the outside. The interior build quality was about a 5. I test drove the 09' F150 and wanted the Lariat, but couldnt afford it but the XLT ""for the price"" is a VERY nice truck, quiet, gas mileage is GREAT and the 4.6 ltr runs good.","The new guages look nice in the day and at night, the fuel mileage is incredible, the comfort is great and the build quality is top notch.

I immediately went to the Chevy dealership and then for some reason decided to stop buy a Ford one after that.  Although I have always thought Chevy has a more classic and attractive body style, I was blown away by the interior of the Ford.  Simply put, an outstanding and elegant design.  It was a tough choice but was able to get a better price on the Ford and so went with it.  So far, I love the truck.  Has a less powerful feel than the Chevy even through I got the 5.4L but it is still more than adequate for my needs.  I have to thank my wife for pushing me to American - better product than Toyota.","Sync, unbelieveable interior design, tailgate step, so quiet","Telescoping steering wheel, tall bed hard to lift into, add drivers left foot rest, straight line desing on front windows - get rid of that hump."

I priced other trucks in the same class and found this new F- 150 has a far better exterior. It's quieter and the interior was tops for the money compared to a Dodge, Chevy, or GMC.  First week after purchasing the truck it turned heads and had people coming up to me in parking lots just to say what a great looking truck it was!! After a long drive with the family (over 8 hours), even my mother-in-law had to say that it's a hell of a truck in comfort, ride, and interior space. She even liked the look and price!

Other than the lack of a little power over the hemi this truck is light years better than the Dodge in every other way. This truck is fun to drive! The power from the new 5.4 is nothing to laugh at though. This will serve me just fine. The only thing I notice is the inside door panels push you in the truck to keep you away from the windows so as in an accident your not in the way of the side curtain air bags. This makes it just a little uncomfortable however nothing you couldn't get use to. Look around at this truck, you'll find a lot of neat things!","The ""SYNC"" system is unbelievable. The room in the cab is almost as much as the ""Super Duty's"" The safety Ford built into this new 2009 is next to none. I also like the sound of the exhaust, Ford also redesigned this to make it sound throatier. The six speed transmission makes this truck jump alive.",Grab handle on the driver's A post. Ford also needs to come up with a solution to stop the nasty break dust! They put nice wheels in these trucks just to have them all yucked up with break dust.

My previous truck was a 2002 F150 and the 2009 is light years ahead in refinement. I couldn't believe how quiet the truck is, allmost as quiet as my wifes Toyota Highlander. The sync system is awesome, hook up your Zune and everything is voice activated. I was concerned about the gas mileage coming from a 6cylinder to a V8, believe it or not I'm averaging close to 19mpg in mixed driving vs 15mpg with my old 6 cylinder. Build quality seems good no issues so far. Very happy with my decision. Would highly recommend a test drive for anyone trying to make a decision.

It is comfortable, rugged, can hold a lot, and has conveniences that make it a pleasure for drivers of any age. No more skinned knees or sprained ankles getting into and out of the bed, and the side steps make reaching into the front of the bed a snap. I really like the cargo management system to control movement of smaller loads. The seats are a notch above others in this class, much more comfortable than the 2008 Tundra I just sold. Visibility is great, even the radio sounds good. Having owned and driven well over 20 trucks over the years, my comment that it is the best I have owned actually means something.

Love most things about the truck, but here's my beefs after 1,000 miles (Platinum Version)- I have a very bad back and initially thought the seats would be comfortable, but between the fact that the steering wheel is such a long reach once seat and pedals adjusted all the way to the floor, and because the top of the seat tilts forward, it is not comfortable at all for more than 5 minutes- to 99% of people, this would be no problem. Also, the steering wheel has two problems- if you're tall like me (6'1""), your knees will hit the back of the steering wheel, kind of aggravating. This thing desperately needs telescopic wheel.

The inside is a great update from my old tank. the sound from the 6 cd sirrus radio is beautiful. the seats are comfortable and the room is big enough for a dead body with the back seats up. the outside styling is another reason to buy this truck. the new styled tailgate that weighs half of the 85s  and the chrome grill is an eye catcher.

Very smooth ride, quiet, and stylish. The Lariat interior (spring for the captain's chairs with the floor shift) is very, very nice. There are so many little features that add to the comfort of this truck that you'll still be discovering (and appreciating) them a few weeks in.

4.75,Go for the Platinum-BUY AMERICAN!,dvick ,04/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Looked at everything on market- saw the competitive videos that Ford did, that, plus the fact that it is an IIHS Safety pick made the decision-even tough I liked the looks of the Dodge better.  Go for the Platinum, you get the deployable running boards, infinitely adjustable tilt wheel and much more for less than $1G more than the KRanch. Others talked about the headrests, they can be bent back out of the way w/out hurting the seat. Only have about 275 miles, all in town, getting about 12mpg, about as expected. This is one ritzy truck, rides like a Caddy, hauls like a Superduty; safe, strong, well built- can't go wrong! Will update later when I know more about MPG over long haul. ","Fully articulating 10 way seats for BOTH Driver and Pass (for those of us with bad backs, this is a must-have)- NAV, SYNC, Bluetooth, smooth ride, towing stability control. Extra sound insulation in Platinum works! Smooth 6spd, beautiful interior looks like it was designed by Audi- simply gourgeous!","Wood on steering wheel very slippery, make leather wheel std. Desperately needs telescopic wheel. Needs more power. And,PLEASE do something with the big square grill- it's garish- even for a Texan! And how about a DEAD pedal? Apart from that, GREAT job, Ford, never thought I would own another one! "
5,FX-4 ROCKS!!!,j.m. ,04/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I keep writing reports because everyone must know how great Ford Trucks are. I just sold my 05 FX-4 with 92,000 for $15,000 and that truck was great. Not one single problem! I have had this 09 since late October, and between horse trailering and work, I have accumulated 17,600 miles. Friend and I did 2800 mile roadtrip from NJ to FL in Feb. and I ave. 19.1 mpg doing 75 with ac on and that includes the Orlando and Miami Beach traffic ( and I have the biggest combo Supercrew 4x4 with 6.5 ft bed and 3.73 rear and 5.4) The ride and handling are great. I pulled a car trailer loaded with 69 Torino and 73 Suburban at the same time for 80 miles, no problem. This is simply the best truck on the road!","TOWING ABILITY ( I need a good tow vehicle and I got it) SONY, SYNC, NAVI, SEATS, ELECT. DIFF, RIDE, HANDLING, BRAKES, SPRAY IN BEDLINER, So many nice features that my 08 BMW 5 driving friend copliments the interior. Rear view cam is great for trailer hooking. Oh, the best one, the Blue Ovals ;-)  ","I see what ya'll mean by those headrests. And still I long for telescopic wheel, tho I have long arms so it aint too bad, power pedals help. The constant ""sir, your fuel cap is missing."" from the NJ gas station attendees (lol). "
5,Drive the Ford LAST! ,GOTOPLESS ,04/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have owned them all. The last was the Toyota Limited Tundra. Yea, it is nice, but....IT WAS NOT A FORD. Ford has built a great all around truck. Easy to drive, park, haul, pull, ect. Plenty of power, great improvement in transmission, descent gas mileage, backup camera is a must for the boat pullers. No hoopla. GREAT TRUCK!","Better gas mileage, backup camera, easy to navigate in parking lots.","Headrest adjustmment is a must, telescoping steering wheel is also a must on this priced truck. (don't let it stop you from buying)"
5,Best Ford EVER!,Firemark ,04/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've owned several Toyotas, just sold my O4 CrewCab Tundra.  I was blown away with the quality and features of the Platinum F150.  This holds up well past the first impression.  Now have over 3,500 miles in 3 months and haven't found any flaws.  Interior room is cavernous and perfectly appointed.  The reason I bought this was the rear floor space when you fold up the seats.  New Tundras have NO floor space in back since seats only fold down.   The Synch system took longer to learn than all other features.  The blue- Tooth phone provides the best quality call ever, even vs the handset on the phone.  Gas mileage exceeds my old Tundra, never less that 13.5 with best 15.5 on a highway trip.","Front seats are incredibly comfortable.  The other reviews with headrest concerns just haven't adjusted the seat properly or they're very short.  I'm 6'2"" and it's a perfect fit.  The Rear View camera with range sensor is very handy, especially when someone walks behind you while backing up.","My first wish would be a full size power down rear window similar to the Tundra LTD.   I had the Factory Remote Starter system installed.  Unfortunately, it activates all controls as if the key were inserted.  It would be better if it waited for the key...

Superior ride, billet solid, no squeaks. Seats MUCH more supportive than last model, last one hurt my back after only 10 minutes. Ford did their homework-anti-trailer sway control might save your life-only thing I disliked is the gawdawful grill-I'm from TX, where everything is big, but they went overboard! Last model's grill much more attractive. Will purchase Platinum vs King Ranch- price it out, there's less than $1,000 difference, and you get the automatic running boards that are actually in the right place to use as a step when deployed.","Solid, quiet ride, limo like backseat, beautiful interior, orthopedically designed, fully articulating front seats, safety features superior to anything out there; innovative features like tailgate step (great for people with bad backs),power side steps (Platinum only)","Needs more power. Telescopic wheel, and how bout a dead pedal? Oh, and do a little rhinoplasty on that grill! Reclining rear seats would be nice, there's plenty of room. OTher than that, perfect truck- will replace my SUV and tow tons more!"
4.125,poor exterior design flaws,20victory03 ,04/01/2009,,,4,3,3,5,,5,3,5,5,"I just purchased a new 2009 Ford F-150 4x4 XL  Regular Cab.  I Love the truck except for 2 flaws in design. First...The head rests protrude out from the seat back about 5 inches which pushes your head in a lookdown position. The seat must be reclined back in order to level out your head so you are looking out the windshield instead of down at the bottom of steering wheel. I turned the headrests backwards which now has zero protection in the event of a rear collision but it now is comfortable. Secondly, The 2 openings on either side of license plate has 2 brackets that Fords engineers have no clue of what they are for, sitting there and is an eye sore,these holes are for extra cooling. The holes supposedly, according to the engineers route extra air up to the radiator for engine cooling. If this is a fact, Ford should have installed air intake ducts to direct air up to the front of radiator...not filled the back side with a rubber mat, enclosing the area. ", ,Change the headrest design... Install 2 small air intake ducts where the 2 holes are on either side of front license plate to dress up front and hide the 2 mystery brackets. Or install a larger core radiator for better engine cooling. 
5,A+,Craig ,03/31/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my 10th new Ford truck since 1986 and may be the best one yet!. My last was a loaded 2005 supercrew. I had no complaints with it but just went looking to see what deals were out there and drove away with a new 09. Great gas mileage 19mpg, even here in WV. The extra 6"" of cab room are very noticeable and appreciated (6'5"" 350). 1100 miles no problems. Great truck   ",Extra room and the very improved gas mileage.,"Exterior, I think the 4x4 sticker is very cheap looking but it can be removed"
5,Could ask for more!,Doug M. ,03/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased my F-150 about 2 and 1/2 months ago. It was a replaemnet for my 08.5 Nissan Titan-which was totaled- it collapsed like a tin can! Bought the Ford instead of getting another Titan and definately made the right choice! It Looks better, better gas mileage, more comfortable and roomy. My family and I have taken numerous trips to see my family out of state in this short time and the family loves it! Average about 20mpg on the trip when I set the cruise at 75 very pleased with that. Just a great buy and great truck. My first ruck was a Ford and have owned a Dakota, Ram, Frontier, Titan , Ranger and will only buy an F-150 from now own! Love it.

Great price for a great truck.  I have some upgrades from the king ranch and platinums I test drove; I am getting the dvd headrests and the dealer is obtaining a lexan roll-up bed cover, which all pickups should have.  We ordered the white sand tri-coat metallic and the 20"" KR wheels, navigation/Sync and moonroof.  The whole thing is a luxurious work truck that does a fair job of passing as a limousine.  Wonderful blend of technology, industrial design, strength, beauty and versatility.  I compared this to Dodge, Chevy and Toyota.  In the end, the Ford had the best combination and the best $.","Exterior and interior design (reminds me of a Lincoln inside), Sync technology, versatility of lexan- covered rear bed, comfort, huge rear seat/loading area, great looks.  Excellent organization.","Make the headrests not so aggressively tilted forward.  Allow owners to push that back some.  Raise the door armrest up to be level with the center console; it feels ergonomically off having the armrests slighter lower than the console.  Telescoping steering wheel.  More power, better mileage."
5,Best vehicle I've ever owned.,AmericanCarFan ,03/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have owned many vehicles over many years, including many trucks. This new Platinum series F150 is definitely one of the best. Incredibly quiet, comfortable and well built. The new 6 speed automatic with tow/haul works very well. Fuel mileage is on par with what you would expect for a vehicle of this weight and size, but I actually find it to be better than many in this category. This truck is so good, even some of my Chevy truck friends are looking at Ford! The combination of comfort and utility, with 11,100 lbs of towing and high load capacity is unbeatable. Kudos to Ford and Ocala Ford dealer for a superior product!","Comfortable, quiet interior, fantastic nav and stereo system.",Telescopic steering wheel would make it perfect.
5,Awesome Crew Cab,rnnick ,03/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We wanted 4WD pickup toughness with a spacious cabin, and a smooth, quiet highway ride.  We got it!  We drove the Dodge Crew Hemi and the GMC Sierra Crew.  In our minds, Ford won hands down.  The GMC CrewCab way too small.  The Dodge came in 2nd with better Discounts/Rebates, but we felt the Ford was worth the extra money.  I wanted the 3V 4.6L with the 6sp Auto.  I have seen up to 22mpg driving 60-65. Still has a tow rating well over 9000lbs.  Plenty of power with the 4.6L.  In my opinion, if you don't need the extra towing of the 5.4L then get the 4.6L.  Fit/Finish excellent - no rattles/squeaks so far. My wife never wanted to drive a truck before this one - now I'm stuck with her car!","Sync, Seat Comfort, Highway Ride, Off Road Ride, Quietness.",Not a whole lot - maybe make a sprayed in bedliner standard.

I ordered the new 2009 F150 King Ranch, to be custom built at Ford's Dearborn factory.  I will take delivery in about a month.  The test drive was great; this is one solid vehicle.  Not a dragster like the Tundra, but who cares?  The Ford won't twist and rack like any of the other 1/2 ton trucks in its class when going over dirt roads and I can tow more than the others.  Also, the box is higher, which means I can fit more stuff into it and the exclusive rear step help me get into the box without crunching my knees on the tailgate.  More later after I get it. ","Great new styling; I love the architectural dash redesign!  Sync is amazing!  I didn't realize all the things it could do until the dealer demonstrated it.  My Chevy had OnStar, which I liked a lot, but it didn't do all of these things.  Wonderful leather in the King Ranch.  Huge backseat area.","I got dvd headrests for 2 reasons; one, I want to be able to run dvds in the backseat, and 2, Ford's engineers should know better than to have their basic headrests from tilting forward so much.

The GPS and Senc are a wonder of technology. The heated and cooled seats are feature I will buy in all future cars/trucks. The new larger front doors make ingress and egress easier. With all the room in the back seat it seems like Ford could have done better with the rear seats. We looked at Dodge's new truck and it was a close call but who knows if Dodge will make it, Ford seems sounder. Speaking of sound the Ford is quieter than my BMW. I am impressed at the value and quality Ford offered.  ","Seats, GPS, Senc, power, trans, value and quality. I traded in a Ford f350 diesel 4wd and was surprised at how well the truck had held it's value. Quiet and ride.","Dodge does have more power. Better rear seats.

I parked it next to my friends 05 FX4 and mine was about 3 inches taller. This is a beefy truck. As big as it is, I get great gas mileage. I plan to install a K&N intake which should up my mileage another 10% or so.
