3,Liked old body style better,Shelia Jackson ,06/17/2016,3,3,3,,,5,5,3,3,,,"If you had and loved the 2003-2008 Matrix or Vibe, you will most likely be disappointed in the body style that came out in 2009. The hatchback window doesn't open, the larger engine isn't as fuel efficient, and it doesn't have the roof racks. The clutch in my 2009 Matrix is very hard to engage. I had my 2003 Vibe for 7 years and had well over 200,000 miles on it before I totaled it. In my haste to get as close to the same car, I bought the 2009 Matrix. After five months, I'm trying to find a low mileage, pre 2009 Vibe or Matrix and sell the one I have now.",,

4,Matrix - Better than the sum of it's parts,Ken Tejada ,04/16/2016,4,4,5,,,5,4,4,4,,,"To give context, my previous car was a 2003 Mazda Protege5 - 5-speed manual. That car had fantastic handling and it felt faster that it was. This car is a better car. It feels more solid, not as tinny as the Protege5. It is not as fun as my Mazda, but it is close enough. The rally style 5-speed manual shifter mounted on the Matrix's center console feels accurate with rifle bolt precision. Steering feedback from the electric unit was decent. The suspension is firm but comfortable, sporty but not a sports car suspension. The interior feels cavernous to my 5'8"" frame.  Acceleration is good from the 158 hp 2.4L engine. The car is not WRX fast, but fast enough. Passing on the highway is a breeze, thanks to the ample torque (162 lb-ft). It feels nice that the Matrix can still pull from only 1500 RPM in top gear. Front seats are comfortable as well as the rear seats. The rear seat is not that wide though. The rear seat can hold 2 people comfortably but 3 full sized adults will be cramped. The rear cargo hold is pretty large. The seat cloth is of good quality, but it would have been nice if there was a leather option. I compared the Matrix's rear cargo area to my friend's 2010 Scion xB and it indeed holds more cargo even than the xB, even though the xB has a more  functional square cargo area. We verified this by stacking 32 count spring water bottle packs at a Wal-Mart in NJ. The Matrix could pack more water bottle packs than the xB. Who knew!?!? And this is with the rear seats up. BTW, the rear seats fold flat so you can effectively double your cargo capacity. That came in handy for my IKEA trips. The JBL audio system, JBL subwoofer and JBL speakers sound great, no need to upgrade for now. The overall fuel economy is 27 mpg, 80% highway. This car has been pretty reliable so far. I deducted a star because of the outward vision, engine and fuel economy. The front pillars are real think. Sometimes, you can't see people crossing near you in the city, very odd. Others point to the rear visibility as a problem, but Toyota has provided large mirrors, if adjusted properly will get largely get rid of the blind spots. The engine, though smooth, eats some oil, despite filling it with Mobil 1. You have to check your dipstick more often to make sure you are not low on oil. The fuel economy should be better for a 4-cylinder. In addition, the paint could have been more lustrous and there could be less hard plastic everywhere, but this is a Toyota, not a Lexus. There should not have been so much hatred from the automotive press for this car. The car handles well, is fairly comfortable, has good acceleration, good sound system, cavernous interior space for 4 people or for cargo. True the interior could have been more upscale considering the MSRP at the time, but that alone should not have drawn the ire of so many automotive journalists. I guess these journalists don't understand that regular people are fine with vehicles that can do many things well, which is what this Matrix does. True the Matrix is not as fast as 370Z, as fuel efficient as a Prius, or as good a people and cargo hauler as a Sienna, but that's OK. At least for me it is. Just test drive any vehicle before you completely pass judgment based on what the press opines.",,

Positives: I get 27mpg in town & 30-35 on the freeway with the 2.4L engine. I'm 6'3"" and have plenty of headroom. I love the smart gears which allow me extra power going up hills or lower gearing for the heavy snows. The storage is great and I've gotten lots of compliments on the rear seats. I love the peppiness and get up and go the car has when getting on the freeway. Cons:Yes, there is a lot of road noise and performance tires needed for the XRS trim are more expensive than regular tires and only last 36K-40K miles at the most. This is a great car. I plan on keeping it a long time. ",,It would have been nice for the top of the line XRS to have a power seat and for the front passenger seat to have a raise and lower feature same as the driver seat.

The latest issue affects all matrix and corollas with the 1.8L engine and will not be covered after the 60000 mile warranty runs out.

The seats looked cheap so I bought some leather seat covers for $20.00 each and they been very comfortable. I have noticed the Paint is very cheap there are lots of chips on the hood ! A bicycle ran into the front when I was parked and pushed the bumper off to the side about 1/2 inch. I wonder how it would be in a real accident? We took a trip from Tulsa, OK. to Whittier, Ca. 3500 miles and had a very nice trip. The 1.8 cyl ran up over all the mountains with cruise control, on and the air conditioner on, and never slowed or had any problem.

This car feels confident on the highway and quick in the city. I personally prefer the styling of this Matrix to a lot of its competitors out there. They did a great job with the front grill. The suspension is hard and the ride can be rough in the city, but this is expected from a car of this type. Nonetheless, the stability control works well. Brakes are excellent and the seat are very comfortable for me (I'm about 5'11 200 lbs). Comfort is a premium for me since I have issues with my knees for long journeys. Overall, this matrix gives you a smooth ride and great gas mileage. ","Plenty of cargo space with hatch, very reliable, looks great (I have the black sand pearl color), practical, good gas mileage, stability control, great pick up from dead stop, and a functional interior.

Had an Accord prior and wanted to size down for more gas savings and better maneuverability with a small vehicle with good storage space.  I liked the balance offered by the Matrix and thus far it has been a great little car. I got the 1.8 engine on purpose to save gas, and it is surprisingly peppy.

My only complaint is the way it rides on those low profile tires (45's).  I think I have finally figured out the best air pressure for the best ride at 4k elevation.  I've gone from the recommended pressure of 32 psi up to 35 and down to 30 and then 28.  At 28, the ride was pretty good, but you could tell the tires were a bit soft as the handling was just a little mushy.  Plus it's not really recommended to go that low as the tires can heat up excessively and cause a blow out.  All this said, I've now gone to the other extreme and am running them at 38 psi, and this actually is the best yet.  I think I'll leave them there.",The height of the car and the visibility.,Lose the extremely low profile tires -  55's or 60's would be more tolerable.

I've driven many of the cars recommended as alternatives. I think the problem is perception. The look of the Matrix is a bit sportier than its performance. But the gap between its main contender, the Fit, is even greater. If you accept that no one really cares what you drive, so don't rely on your car to define your personality, what you get in the Matrix is Balance. I think this balance is what confounds the automag pros. A little sporty, a lot practical, amazingly reliable. Design is Clean & Simple, Driving is Balanced & Poised. Quick & smooth without being completely lifeless. A sport hatch for the pragmatic.","I like the ground effects. The AC vents are great, a small detail but I detest vents that won't aim or stay put. I love the AutoStick. My wife can drive auto, and I can shift. Shifting works best 'clean'; rev it, get off the gas, shift up, hit the gas.

My previous was a 2005 XR, my new model is the larger motor S with a 5 speed auto. The new model has much better pickup and feels more confident on the road. The downside to this is the fuel economy is lackluster. My best mileage when all highway miles was just at 30 mpg. My old matrix I averaged 30 overall with a lot of city driving, and had more than a few 36 mpg tanks. So far after only 5800 miles I've averaged 23 mpg with this car. For comparison, my old V6 Oldsmobile Alero got better mileage. I'm very disappointed in the fuel economy of the larger engine, I keep my tires inflated properly and drive conservatively.",The engine has much better acceleration than previous model.

It still runs as flawlessly as when I bought it and the ride is still as harsh as it was at the beginning.

I have not had the paint chip problem that many reviewers comment on.  I have metallic paint on mine.  I'm not sure if all models do, but my experience has been that metallic paint holds up much better.

XRS comes standard with rear spoiler, helping to give the car a bit more ump to it's looks. Good interior room, easy controls. A few small blind spots in rear, but easy to get used to. I'm not at all disappointed with my purchase. I'd highly recommend the 2009 Matrix to anyone looking for a solid smaller car with great handling, good gas mileage and one that's fun to drive!","Automatic door locks that lock when you shift into drive, and unlock when you shift into park.  Handling around corners with the 18"" wheels. Sporty look.  Nice acceleration. Fold-flat rear seats & front passenger seat. Excellent interior lighting. Comfortable seats with good leg room.",Power driver-side seat.  Tonneau cover for rear.  Privacy glass for rear/back windows. Reshape the sunglass holder so the glasses go in horizontally rather than vertically. Larger door pockets to store small items.

I finally found the 2009 Matrix! After my test drive I was in love! The matrix interior was super comfortable and everything seem to be perfectly designed for the driver. The look is great and drives super smooth! I could have not asked for a better car! ,Everything,Nothing

I love this car, got 34 with NO AC on a longer trip, getting 20-22 around town. Both above EPA estimates for this 2.4 auto. Love the handling and pep, the styling is distinctive and attractive, many compliments. On the practical side, hey I never buy a vehicle I can't sleep in, and this is no exception with lots of room, love the folding FPassenger seat. Roofrack is study for bike. Its a sporty hatchback/small wagon, and a welcome change from poor mileage with Subaru AWD, which I do not need in Central Virginia.

We hoped to retain cargo flexibility, improve gas mileage, vehicle handling and reliability.  With care in packing, the Matrix had ample camping room using a 10 c.f. soft carrier pack on the roof. Skis can be stored inside or on top. Gas mileage has averaged 30 mpg combined; 32 mpg- highway. The car is quiet, steering responsive, holds the road, suspension somewhat stiff, solid feel overall. For its weight, engine, and transmission combination, acceleration is quite good. Seating is comfortable with ample back seat room.  The more I drive it, the more I appreciate its subtle qualities. A car to buy for long term value and not for instant gratification","Dashboard layout; cargo capacity with folding split rear seats. I like the stick shift, but mistakenly drove the 1st 900 miles in 3rd gear rather than Drive; a mistake corrected after reading of manual. Anti-lock brakes and side curtain airbags provide piece of mind. Like the exterior style.","Wish there was more clearance between the frame and road, and better rear visibility.  The radio reception could be improved. The roof rack style and weight capacity limits its functionality without buying an expensive carrier system."

The thought of another six year car payment was dreaded but I'd moved from a 30 minute commute to and from work a day to a 65 minute one and I needed better gas mileage and a warranty so I decided to ""bite the bullet"" and managed to leave with a manual 09 Matrix S.   Not for one moment do I regret it!!!

I never wanted to drive anything but a truck but this little car is really growing on me. The city gas mpg is so so but its a huge improvement from what I had, also I've already been camping in it and not only did it fit all mine and my GF's gear, we still had plenty of room for my 70lb lab to be comfortable and we got 30 mpg most of the trip. I like the re-design of the 09s over the older models, especially the aggressive front end. This certainly isn't my dream vehicle but I defiantly don't regret the purchase. ",MP3 jack is nice and the Bluetooth is really cool. Most of all I like the cargo room it has for such a small feeling car. My dog goes everywhere with me and it has held us both very comfortably. ,Not too much to complain about except that I wish it had an A/C vent in the backseat because although were nice and cool in the front seat the dog is a little warm back there and for a few months during the summer sometimes rolling the windows down doesn't cool her off as quick as I would like.

I have been experiencing a vibration on the light console above the gear selector (Map Console?).  The vibrations occur only when the sun is low or set, but will start even on a smooth road.

Gas mileage on the trip ranged from 27 on very hilly interstate to over 33 on flat interstate all with A/C on.  At home we consistently get 30 to 32.  We like the higher profile of the car and the ease of getting in and out.  The headrests are a problem for short people (5') as we've had to turn one around to accommodate my wife otherwise it pushes into her head.  We don't care for the low profile tires as they ride rather hard on the country roads where we live if inflated to recommended pressure (32 psi).  They're better at 30.  Like the 17"" wheels though.","Multiple height adjustment for driver's seat.  Power from the 2.4 engine and the gas mileage.  Better than the EPA sticker.  Cargo room even with back seats up.  Held a lot on our trip.  XM radio is great.  Mudguards and cargo mat purchased as accessories, but well worth it.",Make headrests with tilt adjustment forward and back (like my Camry has).

Only slightly smaller in back than my 4runner. 2.4L engine is great but reduces mpg. I get 30 highway. 35 would be more to my liking. It's worth it to me so far though. 5-speed manual is fun but needs one more gear on the high end. A 6th speed (extra overdrive) is what it really needs. That would gain a few mpg and reduce revs on highway. This engine could handle it. Gas pedal seems to be on wrong angle for me (6' and slim). Right foot hurts if I drive highway too long. Always get a nice greeting when people see it, esp younger. It is a slick looking car. Clutch was jumpy for first 1000 miles, ok now.","Fun to drive, 2.4L engine, nice utility space, not bad on gas, reasonably priced.",Matrix is geared down vs corolla but an extra overdrive gear would be perfect. Do something about tall drivers comfort of right foot on gas pedal. Maybe better angle? Maybe more tension on gas pedal spring? I put an extra spring on mine and it does seem to help.

I test drove a Rabbit, which felt small compared to the Matrix, which seems bulk.  The car has a heavy feel and is very comfortable on long drives.  I am getting 29.5 mpg highway and 20 mpg city - exactly as advertised.  The Matrix offers a lot of value for the money and I am pleased with my purchase.  Compared to the Yaris, this car feels very solid and safe.","The AWD system, trunk tie-downs, tilt/telescopic wheel, ABS, traction control, side airbags.  The very smooth 2.4L engine.

During my car hunt, my biggest concern was the mpg so, I searched for a gas saver but didn't want to sacrifice looks and performance. I ended up with two choices, the jetta wolfsburg and the matrix. I ended up with the matrix given it was more reliable, cheaper on insurance and not too pricey to maintain. Overall I am satisfied with my decision. The looks are awesome both inside and out. I'm kinda disappointed with  such a small fuel tank. I mean, I'm saving gas but finding myself filling up more often. I also think the ride is so-so.

The steering is a tad numb, but that doesn't bother me as everything else about the car is totally amazing.

Have driven other models and the 2009 Matrix has great visbility and it is easy to get in and out of. The seats are very comfortable and the back seat has plenty of leg room.  We get lots of compliments.  Toyota needs to advertise the Matrix. People with other new models have compliment us and said that they wish they had heard of the Matrix.,The six (6) airbags. The Magnetic Gray Metallic color. The overall look of the car very sporty.  How it handles when you drive. The great fuel economy . Smooth ride and the visibility inside the car.,

5,Perfect car for me!,great car! ,03/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The only regret I have with my Matrix is that I didn't get it in RED! I have a white matrix and everything about it soooo wonderful! I love my car and it drives well on the road, although I am still in the process of breaking it in so I am still careful with it. I still have to find my perfect driving spot in the driver's seat but it is comfortable. I get good mileage on this car (28 mpg) and I believe this will improve with time. Radio reception fluctuates every now and then and I don't know if it's the signal or the equipment itself but I am so glad that there's the mp3 plug. Very, very nice improvement on the total new look. I still wish I got it in RED. :)","Everything that's been changed from the older models, great gas mileage and very, very beautiful sporty look!","I just wish that the rear window can be opened all by itself, apart from the rear door, just like in older models. I also wished that the center console compartment is a little more roomier although that will make it awkward for the driver's elbow room. I wish the steering wheel can be lowered more."

4,Nice Ride,GrindEm ,03/21/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Bought the 2.4L with the 5 speed manual tranny in radiant red. This car needs the 2.4L to move the extra pork at an acceptable pace. I love the engine and the tranny, very positive driving experience! I am 6'1 and find it to be a little tight in the seat and in the foot wells. The layout is very handy and will fit a lot of stuff with the seats folded down. However the design makes for the worst tunnel cover for privacy I have ever seen! I really like the new exterior styling, big improvement over the geriatric 1st generation. I love the way Toyota puts their packages and model lines together, clean and straight foward. All in all a fun car to drive, quick, agile, stable, good price, aux jack.","2.4L engine, interior space, exterior styling, stable on HWY, aux jack, reliable, leather steering wheel, nicely equipped for price!","Dash is very trendy and I personally dont like the trim around gauges, cup holders are pathetic, Needs a bigger armrest with ratcheting heights,   "

4.875,Surprising new generation of Matrix,4kbeast ,03/18/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"All wheel drive really helped me out; we got a couple of inches after I got it and the AWD in combination with the vehicle stability control and traction control gave me a lot of confidence. Plus, you get like 6 airbags. I'm a big fan of the new look of the vehicle. I overlooked the previous generation, but after seeing a rally built version at the SEMA show, I was a big fan of the hatch. I've always loved hatchbacks! I couldn't decide between the AWD S or the FWD XRS; both have the multi- link rear, which gives it a much sportier feel. I decided on the AWD auto over a XRS auto or manual because I drive in traffic and need AWD for winter. Both have the Camry 2.4L 4 cylinder.","Bigger, more stylish wheels. Navigation! It has the XM traffic reporting on screen to let you know how traffic is moving. Sweet! Plenty of room for four/five if needed. Flat fold down cargo area; great for my dogs, sectioning off back. Sportier feel. Toyota dependability. Killer lease.",Manual transmission available for the AWD version. Dash is something you have to get used to; maybe it is just personal taste?

4.875,Better than the movie,Anthony ,03/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"The Matrix has a very cool look. The ride feels very smooth as a boat ride. The main reason why I bought the Matrix was to comfort my legs and so far it has done a very good job. Toyota really did a good job augmenting the standard options like the side airbags, trip meters, maintenance indicator, tire pressure indicator. I like that the driver seat can be adjusted vertically. I like that things are very accessible under the hood. I also appreciate the all wheel disc brakes making it easy for me to replace the brake pads when the time comes. I calculated 22 mpg on mostly mostly city streets and 30 mpg on mostly highway driving.","Sporty look, heated side mirrors, smooth ride, good fuel economy",vehicle stability control should be standard on all models

4.5,A new day,sonny ,03/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"I was impressed by the utility, and the ease of driving.  The new look is what attracted me to this car. I had overlooked the car for this very reason.  The car is nimble and even tho its the smaller engine, there is enough go for me. The fit and finish appears to be first rate.            ","The rear hatch, new exterior, fit and finish and the ample engine.","The gauges new to be contrasted, its hard to see the needle on the gauges in the daylight."
