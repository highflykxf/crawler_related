5,Best Car I've Owned So Far!,Hawkskill818 ,01/08/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I've had Volvos, Chryslers, Nissans, and Subarus. But, I've owned my Azera Limited for about 2 years now, and it is the best car I've ever owned, hands down. It is comfortable, powerful, fuel efficient, has a great sound system, and is SAFE! Consistently averages about 25-26mpg at speeds of 80mph, close to 30mpg around 70mph. I was also rear-ended at about 50mph in this car, the appraisers and auto body employees said if I was hit at any higher speed the car would've been totaled, but I came out completely unscathed! No whiplash or even a backache! It also performs very well in inclement weather, remains sure footed in rain, and the ESC system helps a lot in the snow as I have never gotten stuck and rarely slide around. It is also an extremely reliable car, I have never had any issues with anything on it. This is definitely a diamond in the rough car for Hyundai, and I will proudly buy more Hyundai products for many years to come because of my experiences with this one!",,
4.875,Great car but not for snow!,seagypsy1000 ,11/27/2014,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I had my Azera for over two years and I absolutely loved it! However, with any kind of ice on the road, the car became completely undrivable. I had really good tires on it and even going down straight, smooth, flat roads with any type of ice on them, the car would fishtail all over the place. Ultimately, I decided I had to trade it in or risk winding up in the ditch in the winter. If I lived where there was no snow, I would have never given this car up! I was told by a dealership that even with studded tires, the car would still act the same way. It's a car meant for cruising and that it does very well.","Heated seats, Sirius XM built in, smooth driving, sun roof, auto seats.",I don't know how to make this car do better under icy conditions but that would be the only thing I can think of that could make this car any better.
4.875,Azera ,Dave Stoltz ,09/19/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,My wife is the major driver and she loves the car and the features like heated seats etc. After correcting a tire problem the car is once again riding very smooth with good handling capabilities.,Level of control with all features within reach.,"For someone 6'2"" there isn't much leg room when driving the vehicle, best fits someone shorter."
5,A finer car than I imagined,David Dahl ,04/22/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was looking for a comfortable, quiet good handling car, and the Azera exceeds my expectations.   On two recent longer trips the mileage was between 27 & 29 mpg, which for a 3.8 liter engine running on regular fuel is very respectable.  Wish the ""around town"" mileage were a bit better (at around 22+).   The quality and features are outstanding and are the equal or better than cars costing several thousands more.   Great power, great sound system, comfortable seats, and good visibility.  Hope Hyundai retains the Azera along with the new Genesis. I can certainly heartily recommend this automobile.","Power, handling, sound system, build quality, quietness, understated elegance of design, and use of regular gas.",Somewhat better fuel economy around for city driving.
4.875,Best car I've ever owned!,RBuck ,01/13/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I spend a lot of time driving since I commute 4 hrs per day. Thus, I have already put 29K miles on this car in only 11 mos.  I am 59 and have owned/driven a lot of cars, including some very expensive ones (both foreign & domestic).  And this car is, without a doubt, ""the best"" car I have ever owned.  Hyundai is producing some great products at a reasonable price.  The closest equivalent car would be a Toyota Avalon; but the Azera rides better, is more powerful, quieter, and more responsive in handling.  Yet the price of an Azera is thousands less than an Avalon.  Great workmanship & reliability: like I said, I have put 29K miles on this car already without any mechanical problems. Great car!","Quality of construction & attention to detail: this car is tight, solid & well-finished. Looks: some might find it's looks a bit dated, but I find its lines to be classic & upscale. Very smooth, quiet ride: I test drove the rear-wheel drive Genesis, but found I preferred the Azera's ride. Powerful!","It would be nice if the driver's seat could go back a couple of more inches.  Slightly better gas mileage would be nice: getting around 22-24 around town, and 27 on the road; but guess that's the price you pay for the power & responsiveness of a 3.8 V6."
5,Great Car,Bob Greene ,12/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This may be the finest car I have ever owned.  I bought fun it new during the year end closeout, and have enjoyed it since day one. The mileage I have experienced actually exceeds the EPA estimates. I am getting is in excess of 30mpg in highway driving, and the car is not yet fully broken in.

5,Few Faults With This One,Lawton R. ,10/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had the car 5 months, put over 5,000 miles on it, and have found two faults. Sunlight falls on the navigation/audio screen with near blinding effect, and substantial road noise occurs at interstate speeds. That's it. I enjoy driving the car so much that I usually regret reaching my destination. Initially the ride was hard but the cause was simply over inflated tires. Unexpectedly at 5K miles I have had a significant uptick in mileage and now get well over EPA average. I am so ""sold"" on Hyundai now that I expect to move up to the very quiet Genesis with my next purchase.","I like almost everything so well that it is difficult to speak of favorites. I like the interior, especially the wood trim.  The capacious trunk has been useful for carrying a wheel chair of late.  The power is smooth and ample. All features integrate in to a very pleasurable whole.",Shield the navigation screen.  Use acoustic glass in windows.  Install auto stop feature so as not to waste gas idling.  Up transmission to 6 speeds. A rear camera would be useful also.
5,Just bought it and love it!!!,bmbutler ,09/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was actually looking at the new Genesis, but financially the Azera was a better fit for me.  I think it is a mistake for Hyundai to discontinue this car because it fits right between the Sonata and Genesis on price point, but oh, well...........  Very happy with my choice and Hyundai of New Bern is the best!!! I love this car.  ","Mileage for a V6, Bluetooth and GPS and it comes with XM radio.  I have used that for 3 years so glad to have it integrated.",I wish they had kept the iPod port in the Ultimate Navigation.
4.5,Great car-Poor MPG,PoppyJ ,09/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,1,5,"This is one great car except for the city MPG which I am getting only 13-14 mpg. On a trip to the Hyundai factory in Montgomery AL. I averaged 27MPG which is  respectable. That plant is really something to see and worth the 650 mile trip each way. My poor gas mileage is on file with my dealer, Maybe I have a lemon which I am following up on. ","Fit and finish for 1000's less than competition, XM radio,folding side view mirrors, power.

5,"All  I hoped for, almost",Delighted driver ,09/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"It is possible to find faults with this car.  At interstate speeds road and wind noise are substantial. Sun light falls on the audio/navi screen making it almost unreadable.  Otherwise the car is a pure delight to drive.  I normally regret reaching my destination. The car is attractive, comfortable, powerful, and has many amenities.  Cabin and trunk are spacious also.  Just what I wanted excepting the two features mentioned above.",No one feature stands out.  All features mentioned above integrate into a most enjoyable driving experience.  If you count price as a feature then that is standout.  I would have had to pay thousands more for a similar auto.,
5,Concert Hall on Wheels- a Real Gem,AWM ,08/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is an amazing great car with unmatched value. My wife and I absolutely love it. Our friends are very impressed. We've owned it for 4 months and I waited until now to do the review. At 3500 miles, with majority (~80%) highway driving, the long-term mileage has been 24 mpg. As the flagship for Hyundai until the Genesis, one clearly senses that a whole lot of thought had gone into the design, and care into the build of this car. So far, this has been the most issue-free car I've owned, including Camrys and Accords. There are people who would rave about this car if it was a luxury brand, but are more reserved as a Hyundai product. The Azera should be continued, to convert these skeptics. ","The car is roomy, smooth, luxurious, and great-looking.  The folding mirrors, Bluetooth, rear-window shade, wood accents, rain-sensitive wipers, etc. are all wonderful features.  Above all is the music. The Infinity system is awesome. One can immerse themselves in XM music like no other experience.","The word is out that Hyundai will no longer produce the Azera. Why, given that they obviously invested into making a great quality car?  The Genesis is getting attention because of heavy ads.  But the Genesis is rear- wheel drive.  The market is clearly there for the Azera for value conscious buyers."
5,More BANG for the buck!!,JIM M. ,07/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We bought this fine vehicle on August 4th,2008 and been very satisfied with it in all respects except one - a bumpy shift from lower gears to drive. While I find this to be irritating it still does not diminish my enjoying my Azera.  ","The interior fit, finish and standard accessories that are furnished with this vehicle are an outstanding value.

The ride is top knotch and the sound system is awesome.  Braking is aggressive.  The ""manual"" shift mode is fun on the twisty roads.  Fold-in mirrors is a great auto car wash feature.  I found out that the Sun Screen in the back window is not only good on sunny days, but also a benefit when the guy behind you has his brights on.  So far this car has been a pleasure to drive and own.","Kicking sound system, great ride, plenty of get up and go, rear sun screen, Michelin tires on alloy wheels and plush interior make up a wonderful package and driving experience.",A little more height adjustment on the steering wheel would be nice.  A couple more MPG (without taking away the horse power).  That's the only things I could even think about!

With the 263HP engine, it's a rocket. The drive-ability is amazing. It's very sure footed, even in the rain. It's not unusual for me to drive over 500 miles in a day.

Whomever rides in it has nothing but raves.I have had this car for only 21/2 weeks and have not found a thing wrong with it. The price with all thw whistles and bells is so far below the competitions price. The public does not know what they are missing.

I did look at the Genesis - just for fun - but to tell the Truth - I still preferred the azera. I have had no problem with the suspension. Best of all-this is a car that ""fits"" me.

I have owned it only a couple days and the mileage is 25 mpg but that is a lot of highway.  I expect even better once the car is broke in. If you are looking for an Azera, the deals are out there.

Seats leave a little bit to be desired in terms of thigh support, and the leather stitching on the black (gray) leather is ugly. But, I basically love this car. Bluetooth works great. Trunk size is very good. I have some problems with the transmission at slow speeds, as I drive the Washington DC beltway each day. But, overall I would definitely buy this car again.

4.875,Better than BMWs or Lexus for the price,Gary ,03/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I wanted the Azera ever since they came out and finally purchased the loaded Limited with navigation.  The car is fantastic; fun to drive. great firm suspension with a sports car feel; interior is top notch.  The many features you get with the Limited would cost a fortune if purchased with a BMW or Lexus.  I'm looking forward to t nice road trip to the Florida Keys in April and expect to get 27 or so MPG.  The 3.8 ltr engine is real quick and powerful.  Passing on the interstate is easy.  You have to remember to check the speedometer because 80 and 90 mph comes up before you realize it.  You can't go wrong with the Azera.,"Too many: heated seats, power folding mirrors and tilt/telescoping steering wheel and pedals, super engine, auto lights and wipers, large trunk, just everything.",Only one thing: include a multi-disc CD/DVD player instead of the single CD/DVD player on Azeras equipped with the navigation system.

This sedan has everything that I was looking for, style both inside and out, performance and price.

Drove the Avalon, nice ride but handling was way to mushy. The Azera was much tighter, lots of power. Car has every option except bluetooth. Incredible trunk space.  Drove it from Colorado to my folks in Nebraska with my Wife, Daughter, SIL and Grandson. Babying it on the interstate I got 31mpg, coming home with that load and 100lbs of apples at 75mph constant I got 27mpg.  I would have like more mpg, but the available power is incredible.

I have put on over 600 miles on it already. Plush seating, fantastic sound system, more than ample interior space, plenty of power when needed along with stylish looks.

I was considering the Toyota Avalon Limited, but for about $6,000.00 less I got a comparably equipped Hyundai. The only difference I noticed was the Avalon had a quieter ride, but not enough so to justify the price difference.  ","The 3.8 L engine, price, and the upgraded Infinity sound system. I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that the Navigation system will play a DVD as well as CD's. Also like the rear power sunshade. ","The navigation system is good, but lacks the features I have in my 2004 Acura TL w/navi. The Acura has voice activated navi and bluetooth hookup.
