A few months after purchasing, I started having electrical issues!! Windshield wipers come on and off by themselves, all dash lights come on but all gauges stop working, radio stops working, no controls work (such as power windows, door, hatch, etc). even the dealer couldn't fix it!!! Now on top of that after having the recall fixed on the ignition, it isn't working correctly the car wont shut completely off and is draining the battery, the transmission slips, and I have to put power steering fluid in it every day!!!!!!! I will not own another dodge/Chrysler junk!!!!!! Although they look nice and have tons of cargo space they are def not worth the trouble!",,

4.125,Help with driver seat,ron ,06/06/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,4,3,4,4,"I drove Chrysler for 15 yrs. I love them, but in the 09 t&c the driver seat is too close to the front. It don't go back enough. when it goes back it also go down. then you can't see over the dashboard.The front part of the seat is always higher then your rear-  you feel like your sitting in a bucket. If your under 5ft9in I think you will have problems with the driver's seat.","I love every thing,but the driver seat.",The back of the driver seat (were your bottom sits on) should be higher than the front( be hind your knee)
5,Better than expected,3rd T&C 100 Day upda ,06/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just an update from my initial review back in April. The vehicle has perform wonderfully, we have had no issues with fit, trim, or initial build quality. Mileage has improved since it has been broken in, Highway 55-60 MPH around 25 mpg, Highway 65-70 mph around 23-24 mpg. City/Hwy around 18- 19 mpg. I read the reviews from car magazines of this minivan prior to buying you'd thought this vehicle to be a dog, not so, very comfortable, dependable, quite. Our last T&C got us 136,000 miles w/o any work other than routine maintenance. I expect the same here.","Stow and Go has been much more convienient than we had first thought it would be. It has contributed to my wife's impulse buying of large items, since we can fold seats away quickly to make room for cargo",Still would like to have 4.0 liter engine available in the lessor trim lines. A lockable center console would be nice too.
5,Awesome minivan,RIFA ,05/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my second T&C. Obviously, I like them. My first one was purchased in 2000. My friends with Honda, Toyota, or Nissan, with equal minivan age, had to do one or more major repairs during the past 9 years. We never had any trouble with it and it has 100,000 miles. It was time to get a new one. After shopping around, we decided to stay with Chrysler. The 2009 touring is impressive in all aspects.","too many options to list here - you can save thousands if you buy now. The ride is comfortable, the media center is impressive, and the acceleration is acceptable for such a heavy car.  The six speed transmission saves gas on the HWY and it did close to 25 miles per gallon. ",I wish they can add the navigation system for a reasonable price. 
4.875,"I wanted a truck, she wanted an SUV.",John ,05/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This auto satisfied everything we were looking for in every category. The comforts, the cargo ability, the gadgets, styling, price, and even its ability to maneuver in tight areas. It has truly made our life more streamlined and functional with having 2 children; not to mention the interior styling is as luxurious as it is functional. The exterior is more bold with strong modern lines. The previous models were way to soft for me, especially the front and rear fascias. There is nothing weak or meek with this much more handsome model. The interior was truly more luxurious than the Odyssey, Quest, Traverse, Acadia, F150, 1500 and a host of other SUV's, trucks & mini's we considered.",Touch screen audio and satellite radio. The 2 additional DVD players with wireless headphones for the kids allows us to listen to music simultaneously. Halo interior lighting and rear back up camera. The automatic doors & lift gate have a safety stop feature if they bump into anything while closing.,Naturally everyone wants better fuel economy these days. Our T&C is the 3.8L V6 & averages 17.5 town/ 25+ highway which I feel is excellent considering in 30 seconds this thing can stow 5 seats and allow you to carry 4'x8' sheets of plywood or drywall. This auto has just about everything but 30MPG.
3.625,6-sp transmission needs refinement,Hotel driver ,04/29/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,2,3,"I drive the T&C for a hotel.  It's rented longterm from Enterprise.  It replaced a 2008 Dodge GC, essentially the same vehicle.  Overall, pleasure to drive.  Handles well, almost what you'd call 'sporty'. Well-appointed, tightly assembled, nicely functional. Comfortable, though passenger space is compromised in the Stow/Go version, a center bench would accomodate one more adult. The trans needs refinement/domestication.  (See below.)","Powered rear doors courteously accomodate passengers.  But they get confused if the passenger and the driver activate the door shortly apart.  And the previous (Dodge) needed work on the doors after 1 year, the R one refused to close.","Trans needs reprogramming.  Stays in low gears too long under light throttle, wasting gas.  'Clunks' when accelerating out of lowspeed turns.  Variable engagement from harsh to sluggish.  For an ECT, its behavior is not very refined.  (I was an engineer before the collapse, critical of design.)"
4.875,Best minivan around,John ,04/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Very commanding view of the road, most versatile minivan w/all 3 rows folding flat, closest thing to a hot rod van.","4L engine- powerful enough to squeal tires,Stow n Go perfect for my bike trips, great stereo (with subwoofer)","Better mpg (only 18+mpg mixed suburban driving), improve quality of gearshift knob, offer sport handling option."
4.125,My third T&C,Celeste Glenn ,04/17/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,3,5,"I just recently traded my 2002 T&C for a new '09 Touring edition.  I first test drove a used Mercedes E-class because we already own a Mercedes SUV which my husband loves and of course was pleased with the ride but when I asked the question whether our six member family was ready to have my husband's SUV be the largest vehicle in our household, answer came back a resounding NO.  Because have had such great experience with two previous T&C's (trade-in had 130,000+ miles) decided to check out new T&C and dealer incentives.  By the time all the incentives were added (including $3,500 for trade-in) my $37,000 minivan went down to $28,000 and well...the rest is history in the making!","Stow-n-go seats, oodles of storage space, rear back-up camera, second row windows go down, entertainment system, navigation system, bluetooth in car, the list goes on and on...","had to drive in rain first weekend with van and because van is so low to ground drove slower than usual due to some difficulty handling on water- logged road, new shape is more boxy and could use some touches to make it more sleek like new Odyssey and Sienna, acceleration somewhat slow on take off"
2.625,My first and My Last MiniVan,poppy ,04/17/2009,,,4,5,1,1,,2,5,2,1,"We have owned our minivan a year and a half and the check engine light has been on since 48hrs after we bought it.  We have been to 3 different dealerships and nobody can fit it.  My car juts forward and engine revs into the red as I am driving at least once a week.  I have been told it is a new model and they are working on the kinks.  I was also told it has a life time warranty, so why should I worry.  I told them if my car blows up on the highway a warranty is not going to save my life or the car behind me hitting me when I jut.  I can't wait for my lease to be up in another year and a half so they can have this lemon back.  I will never buy a MiniVan again and never any Chrysler again!!","The color, DVD system, powerslide doors and power hatch","Better service, better built cars, etc."

Rides well and so far everything works well.  Bought the extended warranty after reading Edmounds review.  16 inch wheels is easier for getting in and out of van. Averaging about 17 miles/gallon in first 1000 miles, using 89 Octane (recommended for 4.0).  Mostly mixed driving (Suburbs).  Good Engine layout, everything is easy to check.",8 way seat adjustments. steering wheel radio controls. 2nd row windows go down. Power doors.  Halo lights. 4.0 Engine and layout under the hood.,"Reduce inside noise levels. I am concerned about rusting under the doors. The design lets water get on the ""ledge"" and stay wet.  "
4.625,Our new minivan,Ron ,04/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"Our family has just accepted our new van and we love it.  The kids love the fact that their windows now go down and that they can listen to ""Kids Stuff"" from Sirius satellite radio and watch a DVD at the same time.  In fact we can listen to three unique audio / visual sources simultaneously.  For any parent who has had to listen to Dora while driving you know how important that is.  We are leaving this week for a 1000 mile drive to Gulf Shores.  I expect this to be an enjoyable drive with our new Inferno Red Town & Country.",Audio / Entertainment system Stow and Go Power liftgate / sliding doors Comfortable seating View of the road - driving position Lifetime Powertrain warranty Value,Auto Day / night mirror std on Touring Exhaust sound (2009 has more growl than 2007) Leather wrapped armrests for driver/passenger
4.5,Great Purchase,casey ,03/26/2009,,,5,4,4,5,,4,5,4,5,"The Chrysler has been an enjoyment to own, the vehicle handles great on the road as well as handling a growing family.  The features like stow and go make the vehicle very functional for us.  The automatic doors are a must for loading and unloading children.  Very happy so far and hope to own this van for years to come.","Stow&Go, Automatic sliding doors and rear hatch, radio controls on steering wheel, rear heat & ac, interior led lighting is excellent, seats are comfortable in the second row(this was a concern for us)",My only suggested improvement would be to cancel a little more road noise inside the vehicle.
4.75,2009 T&C Touring,3rd T&C ,03/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"We thought after our last minivan we would not buy another, but after test driving of '09 Accord sedan we concluded that they are too low, with no ride/comfort advantage over the T&C. The crossover vehicles, although more stylish, do not offer the verstility of a minivan, and get worse gas mileage with harsher ride. The Touring trim level was just right for us, we have no need for DVD player(s), leather, etc. ","Dash layout very attractive, interior overall quality improved over our 2003 T&C. ",I do wish the 4.0 engine were available in the Touring level without adding alot of other options we did not need. Old T&C had a nicer center console that had a lift cover to hide items that now are placed in the open console
4.375,I love my Minivan,jessNY ,03/12/2009,,,4,4,4,5,,4,5,4,5,"I have had the Town and Counrty for a little over a week. I have to say that I really enjoy driving it. The seats are really comfy and my daughter loves the DVD player. My husband seems to really like the satelite radio that comes free for a year, and we all love the rear view back up camera. The radio is very fancy with the ability to store songs on the internal hard drive. My screen saver is a picture of the family in Disney world. The doors are easy to open and close and the radio is easily viewed while driving and easy to navigate. I know I have not had the car for too long, but our experience so far has been nothing but positive. The car is quiet, love the stow and go seats!","Stow and go seats, DVD player, Radio, back up camera, comfort of seats, smooth ride.","Get rid of the analog clock, what is the purpose of that? You have to bend over to see the exact time anyway, also put a cover over the mirror on the passengers visor, I'll pay the extra 1.50. Also should come standard with a roof rack on all models. "
5,1st Minivan,Robert ,03/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I just purchased our 1st minivan at age 62.  I love all aspects of the Town & Country.  The driving force in our purchase was the stow and go seating.  With the seats stowed we can place an air mattress in the rear and let my wife with back problems rest.  We have found no problems, not one, so far.  We are looking forward to many retirement trips in this mini van.","Stow and go seating, and Hard disk drive for CD's.  No reason to have to store CD's in the vehicle.",Move more options to the standard package in the Limited.
5,Best van I ever had,Kelly M1 ,03/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We came out of a Toyota Sienna that had alot of engine problems.  The Chrysler has had none of the drawbacks and bad dealer support that Toyota is famous for. We love the Sto and Go seats.  Toyota nmade you drag the seats out.  Better quality and quieter than Toyota,"Seats.  Dash layout. Styling looks better than our old ""dustbuster"" Toyota",More interior colors.  Selection at the dealer wasn't the best.  We had to get a van from 60 miles away so we could have the options we wanted on it. 
4.875,Excellent So Far,Patrick ,02/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,We looked at Honda's and T&C's and for the money you just can't beat a T&C. I went from a Maxima so it's a bit of an adjustment but so far I love it. I did however upgrade to the 4.0L and think it's probably worth it.,"Dual DVD's, seat's stow, entertainment system (for us adults in front)",Could upgrade appearance of interior a little but I'm sure the kiddo's will take care of that for us.
4.625,Great Van,Leigh ,02/15/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"This is a great van, good power, great layout and tons of entertainment options. I agree that there are parts of the car where better quality build materials would be better, but I paid $35000 after the rebates and employee pricing.  The Honda or Toyota would be $43000 for the same car. ","Xenon lights, automatic highbeams, two rows of heated seats, awesome engine and 6 speed transmission, lots of chrome.",Use a little better quality plastic on the interior.
5,"First Chrysler, I love it!",Cassie ,01/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have been driving Hondas but were tired of reliability problems. The transmission went out on my Odyssey.  I love this new Town and Country. Quality much better than the Hondas I have had.,Love the twin DVD player and seats,More wheel and tire choices. I would like more color choices
5,Great van,Carly ,01/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Traded in a 1 year old Honda Odyssey due to the fact the transmission failed on it. I didn't want to deal with that for the next four or five years. This is my first Chrysler. It's as good as everyone says they are. Stow and Go seats are wonderful.  Honda had you drag out the rear seats and boy were they heavy! I can't think of anything better. I love it!,Seats are great. Love the dual DVD players. Kids are not fighting anymore. The DVD player actually works when you hit a bump. My old Honda would skip and start over any any expansion joint in the road.,I would like to have the brake lamps go across the back like in the Routon van. More wheel and tire sizes to choose from. But that's it
5,Mini van,david bubnar ,01/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We have a  limited model with all the options and have had no problems. It is the only true mini van still in the market and as such fills the segment perfectly. It is the first Chrysler we have ever owned and I am very impressed. We have owned one Ford and four GM mini vans and this is by far the best and most thought out product of the group. I sure would like to know what products the editor was comparing this with to give this vehicle a do not buy rating!,"Drive train including engine. Seating, luggage and storage space.",The stereo and entertainment system is great but it is difficult to work with and read. I would suggest making it larger and changing some of the screen options.
