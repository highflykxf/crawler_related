I was tipped off by being the chosen brand for the Paris/Dakar endurance race as the support vehicles being that they were champs 10y in a row. That said, I wanted something that you don't see passing by you 50 times a day on the road. Its a pretty unique SUV.This is my first SUV but I'm familiar with the Jeeps and Murano. So far I am very please with it, I got the lower end 4C engine for better gas economy. Still had all the power I need on and off the road. The paddle shifts work great when you need to downshift and take off! Snow, rain, sand and mud. No Problem! Great features and fuel economy at good price tag!","-All the compartments.
-Multimedia System Navigation (although could get an update!!)
-Rear hatch flat door
-Sound system!
-CVT Transmission FWD AWD and 4X4 are great options!
-Paddle shifts
-Keyless entry and door locks
-AC 400W plug very useful w","-Update the MMCS, I would really like to see a new interface! 
-The Paint should be more resistant.
-The rear 3rd passenger seat should have been better planned.

5,Mitsubishi Outlander Lease Experience,hunh ,11/15/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The car was fine; the company is quite slimy. They did not respond to complaint letters. Then they tried to bill me thousands in phony repairs. They also tried to charge a late fee. The car was returned late because the person they asked me to contact was on vacation for two weeks. Then he turned out to be a slaesman from Mitsubishi trying to sell me a new car. What a mess!,,

Awesome sound system (stock), but the doors don't automatically lock, and I have taken it in 3x in a year for warranty repairs: molding on kick plate came off, A/C adapter stopped working, and excess glue on the windshield which was causing all the wiring to be exposed. My Honda's never had problems like this. It gets time consuming and my time is worth something. Paddle shifters are useless-  no one really uses them in a 4 cylinder SUV.

Wasn't so sure about leaping for a SUV, having driven cars for nearly 30 years, but the Outlander is very responsive and easy to drive. Not so sure about reliability yet, but after 20 years of sturdy Mitsus, I'm not terribly worried. Only concern would be mpg, but the trade-offs - comfort, utility, safety - seem to make it all worthwhile.","Heated leather seats! Spunky 6-cylinder & decently mated 6-speed.

The Outlander has a real quality feel and is fun to drive. I tried the Honda CRV, Mazda CX7, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Murano, Kia and Hyundai and this was simply the best. And the price is better than all of these. I absolutely recommend this vehicle to anyone, other than the Navigation System unless you use it in an area where no new streets are put in.",The music server is a great feature along with the two piece rear liftgate. Great warranty.,"The navigation unit works great and is one of the best I have seen, however the maps are so out of date as to make it useful in Tampa where new roads go in all the time.

This vehicle is spacious especially with the back seat folded forward. The fuel economy is better than I had hoped after only 2 weeks - averaging ~24mpgs combined.

I researched vehicles in this segment obsessively, while I waited for the Cash for Clunkers deal to go into effect- I had been driving a '99 Jeep Cherokee for the past 7 years and when the A/C broke, it was time to go.  While I never considered myself into features (the Jeep had hardly any), I am amazed at how many features I got on the Outlander for the price.  Far better deal than any of the competitors.  After 2 months of driving I can proudly say that I have absolutely no buyer's remorse. Love it!","Auto lights (daytime running, headlights when it gets dark), auto windshield wipers (knows when it's raining, speeds up when it's raining hard), bluetooth is awesome, love the FAST-key (great to not have to fish for keys in my bottomless purse).
