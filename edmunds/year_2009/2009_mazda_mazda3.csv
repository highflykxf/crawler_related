I got mine about 6 months ago, and I have loved it ever since. The only issue I had was with the dealership not wanting to replace the recalled gas cap. I had it too tight one time, and they had to take it off and I notified them of it and I was ignored. About a month later, (a week ago from now) it had broken off when I tried to fuel up. Other than this issue, I have been driving this car back and forth from home to class, and have had no other issues. The ride is very smooth, I get great gas mileage (23 city, 32 highway)","Some of the best qualities of the Mazda 3 I would have to say would be:
Great Handling, because when I drive this car, I have never had an issue, and the ride is always smooth.
Stylish Appeal: It is a car that I am proud to show everyone, and I also get great gas mileage.
Good Gas Mileage: As I stated before, I got great mileage for the s touring model. I don't sacrifice saving gas $, for speed.
Acceleration: 156 hp may not seem like much, but I can get from 0 to 60 in no time at all for an affordable car. 
Overall Quality: I don't have to worry about cheap plastic interior, or poor design, or reliability. My car always starts, gets me where I need to go, and it is very nice to look at.","I only wish the gas mileage was better for a 2.3L. I was interested in the iGrandTouring, however,
I simply could not pass up the deal I got. ($11,000) 
A better quality/ not-so-picky gas cap would be nice as well. It was the only frustration I've had with my car.I would have to say the engine is quite loud, I mean, I am used to now, however for awhile, It had me worried. 
My other suggestions would not so much refer to this year model, but to the current models, such as the ""Smiley Face"" on the front. 
Other than these improvements, I would have to say Mazda 3 is a very solid, reliable car. Good for both the traveling businessman, and for single people looking for a sharp ride"

The car's still in excellent shape after more than 23k miles of hard driving, mostly long distance highway miles. No major repairs needed besides routine maintenance and oil changes. Overall I have no regret for my ownership. The most major complain though, is from the P205/50VR17 stock tires and Maz3's stiff suspension. The tires are almost worn out (should last 30k miles). They are very noisy. They are all-season tires, but absolutely horrible for driving in snow! Unfortunately, I've moved to a potholes-ridden and snowy state. That proved to be the most unforgiven condition for my Maz3.","So so tires, stiff suspension, low profile wheels, plus quick acceleration and touchy brakes, the Maz3 provided to be tricky to drive on snow. On bad road surfaces, the ride hurts both physically and mentally (hate to feel/hear my car get beat up so badly).

Love the stereo system.  Only thing it needs improvement on is gas mileage. Could also use a little more room in back seat.  Don't know what the reliability will turn out to be, but gave it a high score based on my 95 Protege.  Test drove 5 cars in its class, and this one, by far, was the best. Some felt junky, cheap interiors, handled lousy, or too expensive.  This one is best value for the money.  ","comfort, sporty handling, CD system, style, nice interior...not cheap like other cars in its class.",improve on gas mileage; little more room in back seat; add the seat height adjustment even on base model.

Fuel tank holds 14.5 gallons. Reads 3/4 full after 2 gallons used and 1/2 full after 5 gallons used.  Road noise evident.  Extremely small trunk relative to competition and other Mazda. As a conservative driver highway mpg is great at 35 mpg, but local mpg at times in low 20's. Audio system subpar relative to other Mazda.  A/C does not blow very cold compared to older Mazda.  Dealer service was terrible on issues.",Fun to drive. Sharp to look at.,"Very small trunk. Increase size relative to competition. Not good for family travel.

I had a couple friends recommend it and after the test drive I knew it was the car for me.  It's got great styling, good fuel economy, and is fun to drive.  The Sport version is loaded with a ton of standard features that were upgrades on other cars I looked at.  The 2.3L engine has plenty of power both off the line as well as to get up and go on the highway.  I went for the automatic (for my wife) but the manual shift option performs very similar to a manual transmission, giving you a little more control.  All-in-all I am fully satisfied and would recommend this car!!","Tons of storage with fold down seats, 17"" Allow Wheels, iPod jack, sporty styling, sport tuned suspension, good fuel economy, great interior styling, FUN TO DRIVE.","Even thought the fuel economy is good, it could use a slightly larger gas tank.

Have both a 06 mazda 6 and this 09 mazda 3.  although the interior is a bit inferior of that of the 6, the 3 is very well built and has seamless lines.  The 2.0 litre is very peppy and I imagine the 2.3 would only be better, as my 6 has a 2.3.  This 3 has very tight steering and has been successful to living up to mazdas' zoom zoom motto.   Excellent exterior as well, much better at turning heads than a civic and corolla in my opinion.  Mileage is decent, although the civic may get a few more miles/ gallon (possibly 5 or so).

It is faster, more fun, better build quality, and does not feel like you are driving a spaceship.  If you want to be bored of your car, buy a corolla.

So far, wife and I are very pleased with the seat comfort,interior materials and design. I also like the quick pick up from a red light that makes it seem as if there's a much larger engine than the 2.0 L 148 HP standard mill. Very nimble cornering and turning... I avoided a stuck car in the middle lane of a major highway with it's quick steering response, but steering is too sensitive at 60 mph + and requires constant minor corrections to stay in lane. ","The Dashboard, cruise and radio controls on the steering wheel, Huge locking glove compartment, firm bolstered seats, effective windshield washer, excellent headlights illuminate the entire road and the foglights make the lighting even better.

I test drove a couple of other vehicles but after getting in the 3, I knew it was the vehicle for me. I did quite a lot of research on every possible vehicle and was originally planned on a economy car. However, the price, performance, and quality was exactly what I wanted. The Mazda 3 is a great car, and does exactly what you would like it to. It loves to be driven, it looks beautiful and stands out (without being ostentatious), and is a dream for someone who prefers smaller sized fun driving cars. Sure you could buy a better mpg, economy car. But for the price you will NOT find a more fun to drive vehicle for the money.","Pricing, 17 inch alloy rims, interior quality/aesthetics bar none, auto dimming mirror with compass, fold down rear seats, telescopic wheel, lumbar supporting seats, Fog Lights, Mazda racing heritage.

Boring right?  Well, the Mazda 3i is all about practical & reliable...but the cool factor is off the chart too.  I compared sevaral cars in the class for the following features: independent suspension & abs disk brakes on all 4 wheels, twin cam 4 cylinder, alloys, 4 doors, timing chain (not belt), cruise, curtain airbags, nice sounding sound system.

4.75,Part III of My Reviews,Fun2Driver ,04/21/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,5,5,"I decided to write a PartIII to my reviews. PartI compares Maz3 to 2 major competitors. PartII adds more details on Maz3. PartIII will add more comments and answer two critical questions for buyers/owners.  Handling is the selling point of Maz3. But on center feel is not as good as German cars. Above 70mph, you better hold onto the steeling wheel tight. The P205/50VR17 stock tires provides adequate grip. But wider tires with directional patterns will sure improve traction more. Understeer is presented in high speed. DSC is not available unless you have the touring model. Zig-zag shifter needs get used to for straight shifter users.  Trunk design can be simplified to yield more usable space.",Why choose Maz3 instead of Mazspeed3? Maz3 is for everyday use. Speed3 uses the same 2.3L engine supercharged to 100hp+ more. Can't run too cold or hot. Reliability could suffer. Lower ground clearance and summer tires are no good for some weather / road condition. Speed3 price tag is $4000+ more.,Why not 2010 model Maz3? Personally I like 2009's design more. It's cleaner and calmer. No need for smiley face. :) 2009 price is lower with discounts. 2010's improvements are not that substantial.  This concludes my reviews. Will sure post more in the near future on long term reliability of Maz3.

4.75,Additional Comments to My Last Review,Fun2Driver ,04/20/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,5,5,"More comments here of Mazda3 for buyers/owners to note. Again this is a great car, simply the best in class. Few improvements here but all are minor.  Exterior styling is great. Head lights should be pointed slightly higher. On downhills, the lights fall a bit short. The red tail lights are a bit dim and small. Should be brighter for safety reason. Though the bumper reflective tapes help a bit. For s model, you get black plastic in real bumper. But it's more scratch resistant, good when loading cargo. Real bumper does flex a bit.",Interior is beautiful. It is the most comfortable seating and natural feel in cars I've driven. Visibility is great. A pillar obstruction is minor. C pillar window helps blind spot. Orange instrument illumination is OK. The blue rings beautify more. Found minor offs in fit/finish for control stalks.,"Manual mode in the 5 speeds auto is fun. Careful, it automatically drops to 1st when car stops. 1st gear is very short, must shift quickly. 5th is quite slow, not for quick acceleration. Steering response is excellent. 0-60 in 8.5 sec is about right. I calculated avg. 27mpg, 320 miles/tank. Not bad!"

4.75,Maza wasn't even on my radar screen,Gulf Coast Florida ,04/19/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I test drove a 2009 Corolla and Honda Civic and this Mazda 3 offered more of what I wanted than either of those cars.  The gauges are easy to read, the buttons make sense on the dashboard. The Honda Civic has a tachometer as big as a pie plate behind the steering wheel taking up a sizable portion of the dash. Maybe that is great if you are a 16 year old boy, but as a middle aged female I didn't like it and I thought it was a stupid design placement.  The Mazda, on the other hand, is user friendly in terms of the interior and had more personality on the exterior than Corolla or Civic.  I got a great (GREAT!) deal on my car and I may be a Mazda fan for life now.","easy to use dashboard features, some standard features that I would have paid for as options in other vehicles like music control buttons on the steering wheel.",I really don't have any.

I love how sporty it is, both outside and inside. Lots of headroom for a car this size. Feels and handles like a BMW 3 series, but you are paying $10-$15K cheaper! Its sporty and fast enough and yet, it still gets good gas mileage. Between city and highway, I averaged 29- 31/gal. and the stereo which comes with the i touring sounds really good, nice acoustic and full bass. I am 6'1 and I bump my head when getting into a BMW 3 series, but no problem at all with the Mazda 3. Its tight, its firm, and feel you are in control all the time.

It was a fun-to-drive machine, but quite costly to maintain, especially with age. So I decided it's time for a new car. I test drove 3 hot hatches: new Toyota Matrix (158hp/4cyl); VW Rabbit (170hp/5cyl); Mazda3 5dr (156hp/4cyl). Here's my little comparo.  3rd place, Matrix. Highs: big cargo room, Toyota reliability.  Lows: Mazda3 copy cat, dull handling, peculiar styling, high price (23k for XRS), poor corner visibility due to large A pillar.  2nd place, VW Rabbit. Highs: big engine, VW fun, quality interior. Lows: uncomfortable seat (angled too much), confusing controls, strange ""wall"" under windshield, questionable reliability.","1st place, Mazda3 5dr. The winner of my admiration and cash. :) Highs: the most comfortable seat and driving position here, excellent handling, quality interior, clean exterior styling, most features for the price. Lows: smallest engine here, smallest cargo space here, a bit more tires / road noise.","My ownership is short, so reliability can't be judged yet. Interior fit and finish is near perfect aside from minor details. Lower edge of real bumper can flex, feels cheap. No sports car, though 156hp is adequate.

My style of driving has been the same and yet I'm getting just barely 22 mpg around town and if I'm lucky I'll get 28 on the highway.

The heated seats are great, the Bose sound system is wonderful, and I love my sun roof. Don't bother getting the auto dimming rear view mirror, it's a waste of money.  Although if I would do it again I would have gotten heated mirrors. If you throw snow tires on it it can also manage the nasty New England winters pretty well.","The heated seats, the sound system, the rims, the storage space, the way it drives, everything about it","This is something small, but the rear view mirror is smaller than a lot of other cars I've drive and I do wish it was bigger.  But that's an easy fix.  Also I wish it had a heated stearing wheel"

Snappy transmission, soft clutch, responsive steering, linear brakes, and agile suspension. The engine power is adequate, but well matched to the car. The interior is well appointed with leather seating, heated seats, moon roof, premium stereo (which is decent, but not great), and HID headlights. The materials feel of high grade, and the design is sharp. The only gaff is the crammed info LCD. The build quality leaves something to be desired. The interior looks fine and the gaps are minimal, but after only 400 miles, I've already got a ridiculous windshield rattle (ticking might be more apt) and buzz in the headliner near the moonroof.","Driving dynamics, well appointed interior, solid materials for interior, exterior styling",Improve build quality. Too many buzz and rattles for a car with only 400 miles on it.

4.875,Pretty nice,JOHN M ,12/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is our first foreign car and she's not too bad. We bought the Mazda 3 i Touring edition. You see we drive a 2002 Vette and a 05 Tahoe so we are used to V8s. We looked all over and went through all the motions in comparing the Civic, Nissa Altima, Cobalt, G5 and G6 and the Mazda 3. In the end we decided that the Mazda 3 looked the best and the gas mileage was nearly as good or better than the others. We like the ride, sporty feel and its pretty comfortable. We also bought the version with the Goodyear tires instead of the Toyo for the winter time. I'm a bit disappointed with the mpg so far around 26 but I hear they need to break in so we will see. ","Sporty feel, comfortable. Decent amount of room front and back. Sirius radio. Manual shift feature. 17"" rims.",Wipers are confusing. Maybe a little better MPG for a small car size.

5,Zoomin' on Oah'u,Zoomin' in Makakilo ,11/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I recently purchased my Mazda3 (5 dr hatch, 5 spd auto - Copper Red Mica) within the last month, after I checked out comparable models like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic and determined they didn't compare.  In my personal opinion neither were anywhere near the Mazda3 in quality of build, handling, response and overall driving satisfaction (definite zoom-zoom factor). The car seems like its rarin' to go right now but I want to ease into it and not push it too early. I am getting great mileage so far, especially with gas the way it is, and am very pleased overall. If you're looking for a great compact car with a lot to give - the Mazda3 is the ""Ticket"".","The whole car is great... solid engine, smooth shifting (even for the 5 spd auto trans), great brakes and stereo, comfortable ride, steering wheel mounted controls and great gas mileage.","Just aesthetic improvements like maybe standardize carbon fiber trim inside and out and if the car has side sills, maybe add a front air dam or lower the front end to match the side sills to give it a lowered sleek look. I plan on doing these things to my car soon."

4.75,Great looks and good handling,Nadeem ,11/25/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I just bought this car two weeks ago and have already put 600 miles on it. It's just so fun to drive. Even though I deprived myself of a manual transmission (it can be a pain on hills), the automatic transmission provides a fun acceleration. Very strongly built, I had someone bump into me (on the THIRD DAY of purchase!!) but thankfully not even a scratch on the rear bumper! The leather interior rivals my friend's BMW 3 Series, and the Bose System is very powerful. However, plugging in both my iPod aux cable and power cable at the same time gives minor buzzing sound (probably something wrong my cable).",- Handling around curves - Bose sound system - Rain-sensing wipers (I live in Seattle!) - Xenon Headlights - Exterior looks with 17inch alloy wheels - Driver's seat is power adjustable! ,#NAME?

4.875,Sporty Looks and a Quality Drive,tippsy12 ,11/08/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought this car a couple weeks ago and I absolutely love it.  I bought the 3i Touring Value Edition in Galaxy Grey Color and paid 16489 before taxes and tags.  The engine is very upbeat and peppy.  Pretty good acceleration for only the 2.0L engine  but I think its helped by a manual transmission.  It handles very well with a tight wheel that is very quick to respond.  I've been getting about 35 mpg on the highway.  Gearbox is very smooth.  Although on very steep hills there could be a little more torque in 2nd gear.  The TVE upgrade comes with 17"" alloy rims which are great looking.  Ride is a little on the louder side, but feels like a sports car.  Bottom line is great buy for the price. ","Sporty look, peppy engine,smooth transmission. Great buy for the price.",Stereo could be improved slightly. Slightly on the noisy side.  Trunk is smaller that comparable economy cars.

4.75,Mazda3 Touring Value Manual 5 speed,Ronald in Virginia ,10/28/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,Just bought it.  Already put fifty miles on it.  I got the manual because it gets better mpg than the auto.  I narrowed it down to a Malibu and a Corolla Sport and for the money this is a much better car.  I test drove a loaded Corolla Sport and figured the Mazda3 was going to be too small for me but I was wrong and it is a blast to drive! I got the six speaker six CD disc that would cost an extra grand with the Corolla and this car has ABS and traction control. I recommend this car to anyone.,Handling capabilities in turns and awesome creature comforts. The clutch and gears work short and very smooth unlike many stick shifts. The brakes are excellent.,Beef up the suspension a little I felt it more hitting bumps in the road than the Corolla and the arm rest is kind of cheap compared to other models that have hard vinyl or leather enhancements but that's why it's the value model.

4.875,Best new car value,norcalsurfer ,10/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Bought the car last week and have put 600 miles on it.  The 17"" wheels and independent front and rear suspension provide unsurpassed handling for a car in this price range.  The 156 hp engine provides adequate power and acceleration.  The 5 spd manual gear box is smooth and predictable, seats are firm and supportive while still being very comfortable.  Smooth and straight on the highway at 80 mph.  The car gets a little sketchy when manuevering through the twistys on uneven pavement.  The stock goodyear tires are hard and noisy, but provide adequate grip on dry roads.  Braking is superb and this is one super fun car to drive for under $17k. ",Hatchback and rear folding seats provide great versatility. Independent rear suspension (only vehicle in it's class with this feature).  4 wheel antilocking disc brakes.  This car instills confidence behind the wheel without having too much power to get into trouble.,"6 sp gearbox.  I sometimes find myself without enough torque in 3rd but too much speed to shift into 2nd.  Compressing the gear ratios in 3rd and 4th and adding a 6th gear would make this car absolutely perfect. More insulation from road noise would also be nice, maybe new tires will help this."

4.875,Fantastic car and a blast to drive!,MJ ,10/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've had my 2009 Mazda 3 S-Touring for just 3 wks. and a little over 1,000 miles, but so far, I love this car! I commute 50-miles per day roundtrip to work and traded in a 2004 Ford Ranger for the Mazda 3 in order to save gas money. So far, the car is averaging 29.5 mpg, and on the highway trip home from the dealership, the first tank of gas got 33.5 mpg, which is outstanding.  The car is a blast to drive, especially on country back roads with a lot of turns. The exterior is very sporty compared to all the other economy cars. The interior appears very upscale and the seats are quite comfortable. Stereo system is also great & auxiliary jack for iPod is very handy. Great acceleration w/ 2.3L.","Sporty looks, great acceleration & braking, handles very well, gas mileage is good considering how peppy the engine is, moonroof & 6-disc packages very nice. Auxiliary jack for iPod is awesome & keeps me entertained for my daily work commutes. Radio controls easy to operate, esp. on steering wheel.","Lights for night-time driving are barely adequate, esp. on the dim setting (almost useless on dim at highway speed). Also, when exterior lights are used in daylight (eg, rain), the dash gauge lights are barely noticeable.  Stormy Blue Mica color is gorgeous, but extremely hard to keep clean!"

I had compared it to several other cars in its price range; overall I am very pleased with my purchase.  The combination of sleek exterior design, modern interior loaded with standard features, and quick and agile response and handling make this car a pleasure to drive.  Features included with the GT trim w/ luxury package (i.e. moonroof, leather interior, Bose audio, heated seats, chrome door handles, modern interior and exterior trim/dash design, climate control, nice front grill, curvy where it counts) support the feeling that I got a ton of value for my dollar.","Very quick and responsive acceleration and tight handling.  Smooth transmission (5MT), easy and fun to drive.  Sexy exterior styling, looks much sportier than the price suggests.  Modern interior design, impressive dash and controls, lots of features and niceties.  Lots of safety features are standard.","Above average gas mileage, but could be improved.  Could use a little more acceleration at higher gears, especially when climbing hills.  Can be a bumpy ride on rough road.
