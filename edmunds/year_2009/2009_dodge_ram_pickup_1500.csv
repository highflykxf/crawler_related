4,Been a great truck,Ben ,02/12/2016,,4,4,,,4,4,4,5,,,"I got my 09 laramie crew cab close to 5 years ago. it's the first truck I have owned so I can't compare to any other brand of truck first hand. but from the stand point of living with it for a little bit I have to say it has been a great vehicle. I got the truck in 2011 with about 29,000 miles on it, now it has about 128,000 miles on it and runs amazing for the mileage. here and there it has had it's issues, the pinions were bad on these years which made them recall them, mine didn't get it done in time and caused my differential to blow. was unfortunate but the dealer was great with repairs. the exhaust manifolds also cracked at around 85,000 miles, at first I thought was a isolated issue but turns out it's common for these trucks. also if you ever have to change the headlights it's a pain compared to older models. used to be just a couple of bolts and the housing came out, now the grill has to come out and a clip thats in the wheel well has to be pulled. other than those issues I have loved my ram. I have driven it from coast to coast and to Canada on multiple occasions and never got uncomfortable. the coil suspension has really given it a awesome ride. as far as fuel economy goes there is always room for improvement but it's a lot better than most of my friends trucks. I put a bullydog tuner on the truck for the fuel economy about a year ago. in town still sucks, roughly 13 mpg. but highway miles is awesome, I regularly get 23-25 mpg at 70 mph. as far as towing goes, the thing is a beast, I pull a boat that weighs about 8,500 pounds through the texas hill country every summer and it does it with out issue, I also once pulled a 6,000 pound trailer from Toronto to central texas, 27 straight hours at 70 miles an hour the whole way at it never overheated on my once.  all in all the truck isn't perfect, but it has been reliable and never left me stranded, it pulls like a train, and sips fuel on the highway. I love this truck and plan to drive it till the wheels fall off. I would recommend ram to anyone who is looking for a truck.",,

My radiator hoses gave way. 7000 miles after that my boyfriend who is a mechanic decided to run a compression test on the cylinders, to find my truck literally was limping on 2 cylinders. We were going to rebuild the motor but when we pulled the oil pan off we found huge shards of metal shavings (chunks) and that factory torqued Bolts were finger tight. Not for nothing but we had the truck maintained at the dealership from date of purchase in 09 every 3000 miles, on the dot. No reason this motor should've crapped out at 87000. Replaced the motor with an atk remanufactured motor $3000 dollars later (no labor we did it ourselves). Get the motor in, on test drive notices the rear end was whining. So, ordered a rear dif from Yukon, opened up the stock rear end to find nothing but broken pieces in the cover. Looked like a bag of change. The Yukon rear end is awesome now. Once replaced that I was driving to work to now notice an engine knock. Called atk (where I got motor) and was told ""keep driving it, it'll go away"". 200 miles later blows a rod through the oil pan . Pistons, crank, rings all internals in 2 cylinders grenaded. Long story short, check compression, if it's bad part ways.",,

Stronger headlights, by far the weakest lights I've ever driven with at night, borderline dangerous. ALL 4x4 trucks should be equipped with tow hooks, don't understand why it didn't come with them. Going with 4.7L engine was a mistake, it burns same amount of gas as the 5.7 and is poor at towing, has to downshift to climb slight rises on the highway.

Dark gray with the 20's, turns a LOT of heads when it's clean! 4x4 works great here in Michigan. Interior design is very attractive, I like it better than the Fords and Chevys! Front seats are very supportive, all of the controls are within good reach. However, I tend to get backaches after long trips. Better stock sound system than the Infinity on our 2010 Journey. Very quiet ride(excluding the amazing exhaust note!), as well as a solid ride. Handles pretty good. Very versatile","The HEMI, definitely!

The regional manager says the truck is supposed to vibrate when you go down the road. It feels like you have a bent rim. I have had no support in trying to get it fixed right. I will never buy a Dodge product again. It's a shame, because they designed a very nice truck. It is the lack of support and the poor quality control that came with the truck I am unhappy about.

My Dodge drives well and is comfortable, but I miss the interior cargo space on trips.

Also the satellite radio is more susceptible to signal blockage than my wife's last two Acura's or the XM in my old Tahoe.","Power, ride, heated & vented seats,  heated steering wheel, navigator, & did I say power.","I wish the clothes hooks were on the side instead of the back of the cab, so I could hang a clothes bar across the back seat.

I am not a fan of the variable valve timing which saves on gas mileage by cutting out 4 cylinders when in low load situations.  The only way to override this feature is to use the tow/haul setting which gives better shift points but it also won't let the transmission shift into 6th gear.  I love the new look with the chrome package.  This is a big truck and I recommend the side steps for easier entry and exit.  Plenty of room inside with the new crew cab.

Mileage is improving as I break it in, but I am expecting nothing better than EPA estimates.  With 500 miles on the truck, I'm getting 13.5 mpg; all city driving and with a bit of a heavy foot.  If you want a truck that is sharp on the outside, impeccable on the inside, and power to boot, buy a new Ram.",AC/DC input; Dashboard computer; Quality of interior materials; Comfortable seats; rear storage in- floor bins; spacious backseat; Dual exhaust with molded rear bumper; Power rear window;,Better shiftpoint between 1st and 2nd.  Maybe find a way to put the steering wheel audio controls on the front instead of the back of the wheel.  Integrated trailer brake.  None of these are close to deal- breakers.
4.75,MOPAR Scores Big-Time,T-LOC ,03/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I have been a Dodge/Mopar fan for years. I've owned many Jeeps, '99 Dakota, '04 Dakota, '04 Durango.  They have al been better then the previous. I traded an '04 durango[family vehicle] and '02 silverado for this '09 Ram 4x Crew. It rides better than the durango and is more versitle than the silverado...with the incentives Chrysler had I am actually saving front end monthly payment cash from previously having two notes.  This thing is a dream, only 3k on the clock. No complaints or critique yet.  I will update my thoughts as time goes by this year","Interior ROCKS, Dodge finally put some cash into interior design and details! HEMI...go fast or go HOME!","Better mpg if possible, a solid 20-24 mpg average would be great. I average about 17.3.  I'm 40 and don't drive like a teenager. But on the Highway or passing those ""cell-phoners"" the power is great!"
4.875,love it!!!!,kevin ,03/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Had mine since January. Love everthing about it. Has the luxary of a hummer H2 which I have owned, gas power that rivals diesel trucks form only a few years back. For the money this is a great all around truck. There is always room for improvement but I personally couldnt tell you what on this truck. My wife loves it and she is not a truck person (I think the heated steering wheel done it). Probably put a leveling kit on it and go up one size and a little more aggresive in tire. ","My Gig, POWER, Ride, Eminities.",Can't think of anything.
4.875,Meets all my needs,Craven ,02/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I am a sailor so I move quite often.  I have a wife, two boys and two dogs.  The crew cab was actually more roomy than the tahoe I used to own.  And now I can haul all the things we need when we move.  I have the TRX4 package with the 5.7 liter motor.  The wife wanted a moon roof so we opted for that.  Compared to chevy I like the fact that I can get the big engine I need without having to get leather and all that.  Drove it 1800 miles with a 4200lb trailer right after leaving the dealer.  Had only one issue with the outside temp guage, but Dodge fixed it no charge.  Other than that the truck has been great.  What a rush when you floor it too.  Can't get enough of that 390hp and 3.92 gears.","Great fit and finish in and out.  Very smooth ride for a truck.  Wonderful for and instant adrenaline rush (minus the kids of course).  Love the fact that I didn't need to get the laramie with leather and all kinds of other needless features to get the big engine, unlike other auto makers.",Why 390? Why not 400? Otherwise the truck was extremely well thought out.
4.875,Can't Ram this Down!,Mr. 173 ,02/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love this truck. I got the one with the sport package SLT. One step down from Laramie, You need to get one now. Got mine for 31K when MSRP was 41K. This truck is fast, I floored it and never broke loose on me, next I was at 80 in no time. I would not settle for less than the Hemi. Smooth & quiet truck. I had an 07 with Hemi slightly modified and this one is still faster. Got to get bucket seats, it goes better and just tell dealer to switch out tailgate with lock on it, I did. I tow a 18' ranger boat & don't feel it. Thank you Dodge for such a excellent truck..","All the cup holders, the AC/DC inputs. Nice upgraded sound, the Hemi power. Color scheme of interior. Comfy leather, Big emblem on tailgate. Orange color rocks.","True dual exhaust. MPG's but what do you expect for such power. Bring out the 6.1 Hemi on the truck. Map for all the bells & whistles in the truck, they are all over (no complaint)."
5,Great combo of power and mileage,james roberts ,02/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have owned Chevy and Ford but this Dodge is the real deal. I chose the 3.21 rear gear because I mainly do highway. Easily will do 22mpg and have gotten as high as 24.9. Great power. Will really move down the road when necessary.  Ride is great and even my Chevy loving 12 year old is now a Dodge fan!,Power and MPG. Handling is responsive and quick. Great visibility.  Comfort is superb. Mine came with dealer installed steps which at first I did not like but after getting in and out they are a perfect fit.,None.
4.875,Love this truck,gnorvell ,02/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I recently switched from an 05 F150 King Ranch to the 09 Ram 1500 Laramie and haven't looked back. Dodge has hit a home run with this truck. I get remarks from people daily saying how nice a truck it is. The styling, comfort and performance are all impressive. The rear seat entertainment system is really cool too. My kid can enjoy the cartoon network 24/7 now. The only nitpick I have is the plastic chrome covers over the 20"" aluminum spoked wheels. Shame on you Dodge.","Rear seat entertainment system, Navigation Audio system, Hemi V8, In floor storage bins, Interior styling.",Add more storage to the MyGig entertainment system and support video files for backseat viewing. Do away with the plastic chrome spoked wheel covers.
4.875,Hold on to your tailpipes,Gr8 Pumpkin ,02/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I have been a die hard Toyota owner for the past 10 years and this Dodge has sold me over. The 5.7 Hemi has more than enough power and is exceptionally smooth. The new rear coil suspension handles bumps as well as it handles daily driving. It's worth buying this truck just for the suspension upgrades. Trim appointments are solid. Excellent gauge and comfort control placement.  Driving this truck is too easy. The body balance and overall control belies the weight of this vehicle.  If your contemplating buying an 08' instead of a 09' don't do it. It's clear that Chrysler dumped a lot of technology into the 09's. The difference is night and day.,"New suspension, 5.7 Hemi with MDS",
4.5,Finally,Pat ,02/04/2009,,,4,4,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"Finally talked my wife into a TRX4 Crew Cab (couldn't pick that for some reason). She was not sure but, when she test drove it she was surprised. I am in the military and we move a lot so having a comfy towing vehicle for her, the kids and me is a must.  The new coil over rear suspension is what sold her, and the interior fits together nicely.  Not many miles yet, however that will change.",407 pound feet of torque and 3.92 rear gears make getting on the interstate very fun. Also very quiet inside for such a big engine.,"Fuel mileage will always be a request, but my 03 Tahoe only got 14 highway on a good day so I'm not complaining."
4.5,First American-made pickup,Darren ,01/29/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I was skeptical about buying a Dodge so it took me a while to decide.  Too many incentives to pass up, so I went for it. Not sure what the resale value will be, but I love the truck for now. I drove every full size on the market, the Ram came out on top in nearly every category. Sorry Howie, I like the heated steering wheel!  When the commercial says, it swallowed a luxury car, its for real.  The ride is unlike any full size on the market. Fuel management cuts to 4 cylinders, but isnt annoying like the GM. The options on the Laramie are unbelievable. ","Interior is immaculate. Styling, comfort and ergonomics are not truck- like on the interior, but all truck from the outside and under the hood.  Integrated Nav, MP-3, bluetooth are an unbelievable set-up.  I think its the best looking truck on the market. The ride is luxury car smooth, road noise 0.","Fuel economy is average but acceptable. 47K and no splash guards-wheels run outside the body in front. No locking tailgate, should be standard. Sun visors too short w/no extension.  Sets up high, needs standard step bars.  All minor complaints, the truck really is awesome."
4.875,It just keeps getting better,Gigman ,01/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've gone from a 2001 RAM 1500 Sport/Off Road 4x4 package to a 2004 RAM 1500 SLT 4x4 package to this 2009 RAM 1500 SLT 4x4 package. I've watched Dodge improve everything in these trucks from one model year to the next. I've test driven all of the competition offerings each time to what was out there.  I can tell you with no hesitation, this is the cream of the crop as far as full-sized pickups go.",The whole thing is my favorite feature!,The only improvement I can think of is better fuel economy - but that goes for every vehicle on the road right now!
5,Does it get any better than this?,Jimmy ,01/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have been driving Dodge trucks since 1995 and this truck is the best so far! I also own a ""2002"" Chevy 2500 Silverado and let tell you I would buy another Dodge before I would ever buy another Chevy! Oh Howie, I love my heated steering wheel, especially when it's 0' outside! I don't think you have to worry about that in California. One thing that is really great are the options for the different traction settings. ( ESP, All wheel drive, Four wheel high, and Four wheel low)  It just proves that when an American car manufacturer puts their minds to it, they can design a superior truck! ","I like the navigation-radio system. The seats are very well designed, I can't wait to use the air conditioned seats. It is amazing how quiet this truck is even at 80 mph! Oops, I only drove that fast once or?  I know when I drove the truck conservatively I was getting close to 17 MPG. ","I guess there is always something to improve, but at this piont I really can't think of any! Maybe a lower price tag?"

5,Traded My Tundra,Rbrous ,01/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My last 4 vehicles purchased have been Lexus and Toyota (ES 330, Sequoia, Tundra and a run-about Corolla). I was going to buy another Tundra until I saw the Ram on the road. I test drove and was sold immediately. The ride is amazing, you actually forget you are in a truck. Everything about this truck is big. The Ram has won me over. And it feels good to buy American! My truck also came with a locking tailgate. It's an option",Nav and bluetooth,. 
4.875,Dodge has really stepped up with new 200,hemilover ,01/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"New Hemi runs extremely well. I had a 2007 Dodge quad cab before. ( I liked that truck as well). 2009 has better acceleration and much nicer ride. I am totally enamored with the whole truck. FYI, mine came with a locking tailgate. ","Alpine sound system- It really sounds great. Navigation with bluetooth hands free phone. 4WD Auto on the dial. Comes in great when you are encountering varying road conditions, so you don't have to shift back and forth between 2 and 4 WD.

4.875,Wow...Best engineering in anywhere!,Tom ,12/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just can't believe how good the 2009 Ram 1500 is! I would put this quality engineering against BMW, Mercedes, Toyota or anybody out there. Simply put, the best. You gotta drive this to believe it. Rides like a Mercedes with incredible power, speed, acceleration, comfort, you name it. Job well done Dodge engineers. Get the Hemi V8 and the 5 speed automatic, essential options. Everything else get what you like, they are all good, depends on what you like. Really nice interior overall, well thought out.  If you want the deal of your life, get it now. Really unbelievable buying opportunities out there.  Best vehicle out there and I have driven most everything.","Everything, but the Hemi is super, especially the MDS system which gets you better gas mileage 15 and 20 mpg. Really quick and nimble.",Can't think of one. Perfect.
4.125,Ram needs a few details added,gabbyhaze ,11/12/2008,,,4,3,4,5,,4,5,3,5,2009 Ram Laramie 5.7l is a super truck so far. Only have a few hundred miles on it. Economy not impressive. Big beef that Chrysler released it without finalizing detail like a lock for the tail gate. Not even yet available to change it.  ,Comfort. Well designed interior but needs a bit more fluff.,Put a tail gate lock on the truck. It is needed. Release parts when the truck is released to public.
4.625,The Best Truck Ever,Smoothbassman ,11/08/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,The new Ram is an exciting new vehicle in the Dodge lineup. The design is aggressive the interior is beautiful the motor is solid and it's incredibly quiet on the highway. The rear 4 link suspension makes this truck ride so smooth it feels like a luxury vehicle. The wrap around console keeps everything within reach and everything is where you expect it to be. The nighttime display is very nice. Hands down I drove an F-150 and a Silverado and this was the smoothest and best looking truck of them all. Also the price was the cheapest of all of them! You can't go wrong with the new 2009 Ram,I sprung for the navigation and remote start package. It's really nice! Dodge has done a good job with that. The media center is so cool with the DVD in the dash. All the storage areas in the truck make everything seem very organized ,"The step up to get into this truck is very high, running boards need to be standard. This truck is huge!  They need to offer a short box on the quad cab tye truck is 19 feet long and wont fit in my garage. The  DVD flip down screen got stuck in the 1st week. It was an easy fix at the dealer. "
5,Insane!,kenister ,11/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Coolers, storage, performance. And I wouldn't dare forget about comfort. I bought got the SLT fully loaded. I couldnt break the back end loose. I couldnt get the tires to lock. This truck is amazing. I am, well used to be a Chevy guy through and through, but this? Good job Dodge. It has the highest power/weight ratio out of all the trucks. I did the math and took it to the street. It feels like a truck sticks like velcro and is fun on the street. Haven't got the chance to go offraod, but can't wait. Took a big train track bump, at 85 mph, didnt feel a thing. Oh and by the way I got an SLT with the 5.7 hemi and the offraod package. It can be done.","Acceleration, got the 3.95 rd and love it. It's got so much power, and 22.68 mpg? Almost too good to be true. The seats, and cup holders are everywhere! Remote start, I can start it from my bedroom when I get up for work then it's already warmed up!","Bed size, larger calipers. and only 7.7 in. of ground clearence?  Next pay check definitely going to get at least a 4 in. lift. Not true dual exhast, yes a little disapointed. but I will fix that in time. Nothing is perfect."
4.5,I owned chevy since I started driving,devlon ,10/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,4,"I looked at every truck on the market. This was by far the best. 2 Complaints BED SIZE on crew cab 5'7"". The Truck sits high <-- Not the complaint. It is very difficult to see a compact car hovering off the front passenger side of the vehicle. Those little Prius, and mini coopers completely disappear.  The ride is a little stiffer than the other manufactures, but softer than a typical dodge. Acceleration is fantastic for a truck. Turning radius seems to be better than my silverado. The 5 speed transmission and 3.55 final is matched well with the torque range of the engine. Positive stopping power. Very easily lights up the rear tires :). The bucket seats are very comfortable.  ",Stupid as it sounds all of the storage compartments. This vehicle has more storage than my wife's kitchen. The whole vehicle is just a superb design. ,The Brakes. The Truck does stop Great for a beast that is. But like most vehicles today the break pad surface area is small. Time will tell.
