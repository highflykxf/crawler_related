5,Best body on frame SUV for the money,Shandor Weiss ,09/11/2015,5,5,5,,,4,5,5,5,,,"I absolutely love my 09 Aspen with the 5.7L gas hemi engine. AWD, J package, 20"" wheels. It's beautiful to look at, to sit in and to drive. Bought it used with 72K miles. This is a real SUV although it looks like a luxury car. I live in the mountains of Oregon down a long winding gravel road,  and have to go over a 4300 foot pass on I-5. It handles like a dream, especially after getting new and better shocks and tires. The hemi has awesome power, even carrying a heavy load and going up a 6% grade it can accelerate like a sports car to pass trucks. Smooth, comfortable handling. The firm heated seats are great on my injured back, as is the remotely operated rear lift gate. I've had many other SUVs, from Subarus to the old Jeep Grand Wagoneer to a 99 Durango with the 5.7L hemi. The Aspen is far better than all of them. I need to tow a horse trailer and it has more towing capacity than bigger SUVs that cost a lot more. It is almost perfect, I just wish they still made them.Update: I've owned this Aspen for 9 months now, and I still love it. I love seeing it when I go out the door, I love getting in it, I love driving it. I put on a chrome brush/grille guard made for the same year Durango, it looks awesome. It handles great in mud and snow, too.",,
4.375,So far a great investment!,cappecan ,02/04/2015,,,5,4,4,5,,5,5,3,4,"I purchased my 2009 Aspen hybrid used with 76K. I've owned it now for around 4 months, and have put 14K on it that short time. In this tine, my Aspen has been an absolute dream to drive and own. Most people who see the hybrid badging ask to see under the hood and are rather shocked when you cruise around on electric power alone. I've had no issues thus far aside from routine oil changes and tire rotations. It snows often where I live, and the AWD system handles wonderfully in the slippery slush.","The Aspen HEV comes fully loaded and includes every feature you could want in a luxury SUV. I was fortunate in my find because my Aspen has the optional ""J"" package which includes a few extra bonuses such as sun roof, rear heated seats ext...
having a tow package is great, as well as the grippy AWD system. Bluetooth is awesome, as well as Sirius sat NAV and TV. The hybrid technology for the time the Aspen was released is rather impressive. Being able to propel a 6,000lb SUV on electric power alone is quite a milestone crossed if you ask me.","The build quality could be better. The styling is too much like the Aspen's counterpart, the Durango hybrid. They look much too similar. It seems Chrysler slapped the Durango and Aspen hybrid into production ASAP to please the market for a hybrid SUV at the time. I've had to glue back on some of the chrome trim here and there, which I guess you have to expect on a 6yr old vehicle. All in all, a great reliable purchase. I would buy another one. Kudos to Chrysler."
3.5,Lemon!!,jweb909 ,08/09/2014,,,5,5,5,1,,1,5,1,5,"Bought my aspen hybrid used (2nd owner) in end of 2013. Drove it for less than 1000 miles and it started draining the batteries when it was parked. Been in the shop for over 80+++ days and chrysler refuses to take responsibility and own up to its flaws and buy me out of it.Tried over and over to get it repaired and finally the dealership may have the right part to fix the problem. Really stinks that they only made a handful of these cars, beautiful and very fast, but when they break down no one knows how to fix it. ARRRRgggh! I would never have bought it if I knew how expensive it was to repair it. Lemon car for sure in my book. Anyone else have issues that cost them thousands $$?","Rides beautifully, looks super clean too!!",Chrysler own up to their flaws in this vehicle for starters!!
5,VCT Hemi Aspen. 376hp/401tq. AWD,car_enthusiast ,03/30/2013,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Edmunds should have the option of selecting the vct hemi aspen in the menu. The vct stands for variable cam timing. This SUV is fast, especially in cooler temps and is a huge improvement over the first generation hemi. It's an excellent SUV: it's safe, the interior layout is perfect,the steering is light but feels great, it's quiet when you're cruising but really roars when you give it a few or more rpms. MPG can be good when you're cruising at highway speeds but watch out for stop and go traffic - then it's a different story altogether. Reliability has been great so far. Also, these are incredibly rare to see. A complaint I have is that there is not a single hemi badge on the suv!!","Sport sedan acceleration, sound of the hemi, the traditional suv looks, the great feeling knowing you're one of the very few people driving these anywhere.",
5,Love My Aspen,revbc ,10/14/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I looked at alot of suv and bought a '09 Aspen and I love it.It runs wonderfully, and its fun to drive.I'm 6'4"" tall and it is very comfortable.I don't know why Chrysler stop making them.I don't care what Edmunds says this is a great SUV.I know the gas mileage is average, but it is a truck.",,
4.625,The Beast,rock47 ,07/28/2011,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,4,5,I have owned an Aspen for 4 years now and it's been nothing but the best for me. I think the middle row has plenty of room and the seats lay back giving you more room. The third row is a little snug but don't anyone sit back there but the kids. I don't know what Aspen anyone else is driving but my Aspen rides smooth!. If I had to say anything bad about it I would say the price of the Aspen is a little steep! and the gas mileage could be a little better. The other sad part about it is they don't make it anymore and I don't wont to go back to a car.,My favorite features of the Aspen is the touch screen radio and the rear cam and I also like the running boards on the truck.,I think the should bring the Aspen back at the same size and make the gas mileage better on it. I know we are trying to make the cars and trucks smaller to have better gas mileage but some people are bigger then others and cant fit in little cars and trucks. I'm a big guy not fat guy!!

I looked at so many trucks & SUVs and am so glad I purchased this one.  It can be a lady with it's cool vanilla color or powerful machine with an engine that doesn't back down!,"This thing HAULS.  At times when I need extra power to get on a busy highway or get around a huge semi, it doesn't hesitate - the HEMI is awesome!  The inside extras have been fun to have and my granddaughter loves the rear entertainment","I would really like the window in the back lift to open separately.  It has a lot of length, but sometimes the extra inch or two would be great"
5,Aspen Limited HEV Excellent so far,tpedwards ,04/29/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I wanted to replace my 2005 Durango Limited with another exactly the same. Problem is, they are no longer made. After looking at Jeep Commander (ugly), Ford Explorer (too small), Ford Expedition (too big), Chevy Tahoe (rear not flat), Toyota Sequoia (too expensive) I finally decided to try to find a used Durango or Aspen. I found an Aspen HEV for a reasonable price.  I drove from Battle Creek, MI to Indianapolis, IN spent the weekend then on to Bowling Green, KY and finally had to refuel. 553 miles of mixed highway and city on one tank!  I love this SUV, but I have to imagine that Chrysler discontinued due to sluggish sales and expensive to build.","Cabin tech. HEMI AND electric motor. This things can really take off with BOTH motors! Slight hesitation, but surprisingly smooth transition from electric to HEMI.",No iPod integration. Really? All of this but no iPod integration?
3.25,I know why they really quit making these,Travis ,01/14/2010,,,4,4,2,2,,3,4,3,4,"I have only put on 2000 miles on this and its been to the shop twice.  And still has problems.  Won't start all the time.  Engine light is one, sometimes flashes (that means there is something seriously wrong and not to drive it). The ignition light flashes, going back to the shop tomorrow.  Only goes 35 mph right now.  My navigation system is broken again.  It lasted two days.   The dealership says there is nothing wrong. But then I get it and it wont start. There is not much leg room in the second row.  No cargo space.  If you travel you need a luggage carrier.  If it didn'e keep breaking down I would love it, but there is always something wrong.  I only have 2000 miles on it.  ","AWD, electic mode, when it works ",Put more effort in the craftmanship or I won't buy another one.  Get better gas mileage.  I get 16 city and 18/20 highway
4.25,Nice Vehicle,Nice Vehicle ,12/30/2009,,,1,5,4,4,,5,5,5,5,"Bought the dealer demo in Jan. 09 and received an AMAZING deal for what we got. I love all the neat accessories like remote start, heated seats, anti roll, and all those other features you don't even know you have. Have had some issues with the roof racks warping and wind noise. Took to the dealership and they did not take care of issue. Thankfully there is another dealership in the area we can take it for service. We just had a blizzard and the car did EXCELLENT on the snow and ice. ","You get a lot for the money. Remove start, backseat TV, wood trim, heated seats, not to mention all the safety features like anti-roll, skid and brakes to name a few.","Lots of wind noise, but i think it is fixable, more leg room in 2nd row. When the 4 wheel lock is engaged it feels like something is rubbing on the tires, but it could be normal. I have never owned a four wheel drive vehicle."
3.375,Nice Car Poor Reliability,Ken ,10/21/2009,,,4,3,1,1,,4,5,4,5,"I purchased the Aspen HEV in Feb. 2009.  I love the car as far as looks and comfort.   I meet all my needs.   But since I purchased the car it has been in the repair shop 5 times. for a total of 37 days down time.   Part of the problem is only quailified trained mechanic's can work on the car.  My dealership has one, so if it is his day off we are out of luck.   We have had trouble with check engine light, transfer case, leaking sunroof, computer control module, catalic conveter,paint peeling and now it has been in the shop for 12 days and I still don't have it, because it needs a starter battery.

4.75,2nd Aspen,rob94551 ,10/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"This is our second Aspen.  First has the Hemi. The new engine combo is slower off the line and the Hemi doesn't really kick in until high into freeway speeds, but the transition across the power band is smooth, and is fast enough.  The smoothness of the ride hides the rate of speed increasing.  The add on specials make the car a great value and a lot of small things are thought of (rear view camera), etc.  Great sound system.   Only thing I can think to complain about, if I had to, is the gage that shows if the engine is in electric, combo or power zone.   The car is stable and corners well on mountain road downhills.  The AWD helps with handling, and much improved over non-AWD Aspen","The electronic ""toys"" are great, one touch rear deck raise and lower, the GPS, the sound system, as well as the AC/ windows, and controls on the steering wheel.  The sunroof is great too letting in a lot fresh air, large enough to be very effective.  The seats are very comfortable and adjustable. ","Two come to mind.  Change the gages to be more useful that fluff (engine setting gage seems to be only show).  The windshield post, driver side is think and when going on a very windy downhill run at higher speeds can cause you to alter your vision paterns.  (After one downhill I easily adjusted)"

4.75,Great Vehicle for the Money,Stan in Texas ,09/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"We actually wanted to buy a Tahoe, Yukon or Expedition.  However, a comparably equipped Chrysler Aspen was about $12K less.  That's a lot of money, so we went with the Aspen.  I've never been a Chrysler fan, but I am willing to give them a shot.  I think Edmunds was too hard on the Aspen in their review. So far (2100 miles) we LOVE our Aspen.  This is a leftover 2009 model and the dealer ship was REALLY dealing.  They knocked $11K off the sticker price and gave us $3K more than we owed on our 2007 Explorer.","Chrome wheels, reclining second row bucket seats, Hemi engine, Navigation system, leather and suede upholstery, power rear door hatch, unique styling. I love the wood trim and the wood steering wheel. Access to third row seats is very easy. I think the whole package is rather elegant.","Better fuel efficiency would be nice, but when you buy a full size SUV you know you aren't getting super gas mileage.

The transmission does not seem to give the same punch throughout a wide range, my Nissans in the past were much better in that area. Interior makes you feel that you are in a nice vehicle, it is also an attention getter on the exterior. For a 6,400 LB SUV it accelerates fast, you are king of the Trucks/SUVs on the road without a Hemi. Will take ""most"" 6 Cyl Cars as well, just stay away from some of the import powerful V6's like the 2009 Maxima. It is a little bouncy on major dips/bumps, but not overly so. The Brakes are sufficient, but could stop a little better. Handling on sharp bends is average at best.","Hemi, Most affordable vehicle in this class size and features, 3 rows of seats, Exterior Style, Touch screen functions, Neat programmable features, Power lift gate, Standard auto start, Great AC when put into Max mode. Not many others have it, nor will anymore.

Has a fully usable third row seat which an adult can ride in. Have myself ridden 100s of miles in the third row and find it adequate.  With seat configuration I can haul six young men and all their baseball equipment. Have an Enclave too, and this rear set entry easier.  My best buddy says the ride is better than his wife's BMW. Have the Hybrid, and it is a treat to get 18 - 20 mpg in city driving, 4+ mpg greater than my durango which i also loved. Quiet, ergonomics great (better than Tahoe), great electronics and sound.

I wanted a Hybrid vehicle, but also desired 4-wheel drive for the winter weather.  The Chrysler Aspen Hybrid was the perfect choice.  The driving is smooth.  I average 20 mpg around town, which includes some interstate driving.  The vehicle is solid with all the luxury features one would desire.  My model has all available options.","Love the Hybrid engine combined with the V8 and 4-wheel drive.  The gas mileage is excellent for a vehicle in this class.  I enjoy the audio controls on the steering wheel, the ability to hook in my iPod, the hands-free bluetooth and overall upscale designed interior.","The leg room in the second or third rows is less than desired, but this seems to be common in all the vehicles we considered.  I would like second row heated seats, but this is apparently not an option on the Hybrid model (perhaps due to the placement of the hybrid battery)."

Handling and ride are very very good, and the big HEMI is there when you need to fly...which you will.  With the tremendous incentives and willingness to deal right now, we purchased this vehicle for a price we simply could not pass up...FAR FAR below the MSRP.
