1,"2009 Nissan Maxima (this was never a $40,000 car)",Joy ,08/11/2016,1,1,3,,,1,1,2,2,,,"I purchased this vehicle when it was about 2 years old.  I have had it now for 5 years.  So many problems -- steering wheel motor for the telescoping stopped working and of course dealerships want to charge me $1,000.  Nissan Manufactures declined to fix it although the extended warranty had just expired -- interesting and I see this problem all over the internet where steering wheel mechanisms goes bad on a Maxima.  This is not an old car.  Nissan will not fix the problems.  Recently alternator went out on while I was in traffic on the 110 fwy in Los Angeles.  Each time I take the car to the dealer its something new.  Lower ARMs $1,288.88, Front struts $1.061.52, Rear Shocks $843.99 and Air filter $27.20.  I took my car to Firestone to get the AC leak repaired -- dealer wanted to rob me.  This is not a $40,000 car.  I would say lease it but never buy it or stay far away from Nissan altogether.  I have had too many problems for a vehicle I purchased Certified.  I thought Certified was an extra protection -- it was not in my case.  My Toyota is 1999 and I have not had this many problems.  I purchased my car at Nissan Auto Nation Power on Rosecrans near 405 fwy.  The car had originally purchased at South Bay Nissan.  I place the blame on the manufacture as well as the dealerships.  Maybe my post will stop someone from buying a Nissan and especially a Maxima.",,

It is also nice that it does not break down, ever.","Nissan needs a Maxima that will compete with the Ford Taurus SHO.

I went back to the dealer 3 times , a rep from Nissan took a look at it. For their fix they went to Home Depot brought a clear PVC tubing and weaved it through the struts to help with the bang.

I had a leased IS 250 to trade in and was looking to spend less but not downgrade too much.  No buyers remorse here! (Except for my backup camera- that was nice.)  I got the S model to save some cash and I don't miss the Lexus at all. The Maxima is a blast to drive and looks sleek- I got a compliment after owning it less than 24 hours. It has WAY more room than the IS but drives just as good. It has good pick-up on the highway and really turns heads. I test drove a loaded Camry SE and it just felt boring after owning the IS 250. The Maxima is a great car- I am very satisfied and can't wait to show it off. I got a great deal since it was an 09'. Go get one!,"Body style, VERY comfortable driver's seat- feels like a comfy recliner, light in the trunk which is something the IS doesn't have, 19 in. tires, charcoal interior has great detailed piano stitching, great handling on turns, lots of room in the back seat and trunk, plenty of leg room in the front","Some of the buttons are not in the places you would expect (power side view mirror), have to use premium fuel (did this with the lexus too), wish the trunk would open automatically."

It feels solid and heavy.  If you ever drove, say a bmw 7 series, when you take your foot off the gas, it seems to coast forever.  As this does.

The ride and drive is a perfect blend of luxury and Performance - 0 to 60 mph in 6.3 secs, yet a nice comfortable ride on the highway.  Very little road noise at highway speeds. I came very close to buying a Lexus GS350 but found the performance + cost superior in the Maxima. Same story with M35.  I already owned a TL, so I didn't want to do that again;-)        The Maxima also does a great job at the little stuff like a strong A/C system, large glove box, great iPOD integration, large map and cup holders, and easy to read owners manual.  Finally, the bold exterior lines on this car are amazing!!   ","Premium Package is worth the extra money - dual sunroofs, air conditioned seat, rear seat controls, sunshade, etc..

I loved the look of the 2007 Infinity G35 coupe and swore I'd do anything to get it after test driving it. Aside from the compact factor, everything else I liked was tech related or cosmetic. I didn't get it b/c it was way over my budget at the time and once the new Maxima came out, it was literally love at first sight. My Maxine (you heard right) has Premium + Technology packages, ultimately containing everything that the G37 Coupe currently has in its interior aside from the 2-hand Infinity clock.

From Interstate driving to finding my way through small towns, the GPS was invaluable, the dual climate control very much appreciated, and the entertainment system was incredible.

After taking the car on a several hundred mile trip, the mpg only reached 21.6( highway) This was at an average speed of about 70 mph and very little use of the brake. The sticker touts a 26 mpg rating.(highway) 21.6 represents about 17% less then promised return. OK we are in a recession and everybody is lying about something but I leased this vehicle for the fuel aspect and commuting purposes.

Manageable price and monthly payments, Very good power, room (I'm well over 6'0"" tall) quality, and have good gas mileage. I looked at Lexus', Infiniti's M45 & M35. I tried to own another sedan besides the Max for a change of pace, but the Maxima meet those requirements the best. This is by far the best Max that I've ever driven! My model is an SV and it's very fun to drive. It looks sharp and aggressive. The acceleration is exhilarating, and whenever I turn off the VDC button, it gives it even a bigger boost. The cockpit design is excellent.",My favorite audio feature is their Ipod setup. The Ipod station is invisible to the passengers because the hookup is inside the arm rest. And you can control the Ipod through the 7 inch touch screen which i really like! No more Cds' junking up my car.

I have 17800 miles due to trips from Jacksonville, FL to Delaware and Louisiana. I have made numerous trips to Orlando and Miami as well.  Great car, fun to drives and it never gets old.  With regular maintenance every 3750 miles, it stills drives new with no problems.  It is a huge improvement over the previous Maxima.  Yes, I had a 2006 Maxima.  It was nice,  but too soft and didn't handle nearly as nice.  The new Maxima is stiffer,  shorter and wider making it the best handling FWD vehicle I have ever driven.  I've driven 99.9% of FWD vehicles in North America.","The Sport package sports a 27% stiffer suspension than my 2006 Maxima.  Also the Ds mode is highly addictive and hard to beat in manual mode.  I love the cockpit look as well as the racing feel when you sit back and pound the accelerator.  Most importantly,  the mechanics of the car.",My only complaint is the fact that the 2009 Maxima is more drag restricted than my 2006 Maxima.  I can only achieve speeds of 132 MPH.  My previous Maxima could achieve 140 MPH.  This is due to a drag restricted governor.  The wind resistance of the car prevents  higher speeds.

My budget was anything less than around $55k when I was looking which included the Lexus GS350, ES 350, Acura TL and RL.  I needed a larger car and wanted something fully loaded out so I didn't bother looking at BMW or Mercedes.  The car is very, very comparable to my business partner's Audi A6 4.2, right down to the rear window shade and rear view camera that shows intended travel path.  The quality of the materials is very comparable and all for $30k less.  This car gets many looks and looks great with the dual sunroof.  Highly recommended.","Quality of materials,rear shade to keep sun off the kiddos, rear view camera that shows where your wheels will end up, voice activated nav (I never use the nav in my wife's Tahoe because it is manual entry, now I use it all the time), stereo system and the seamless iPod interface. The car rocks! ","The only suggested improvements are making the music box easier to navigate and making the sport features (19"" wheels, etc.) available with all features of the premium pkg.

We have been a BMW family for a long time and had been considering a BMW 3 or 5.  My husband saw a Maxima in person, and was impressed with the styling, so we went for a test drive.  I never expected to get him into this car.  We were so impressed with all the features we got in the car (Sport loaded) that a similarly equipped 3 would have been $55k, and we loved the sporty look and feel of the dash board and small steering wheel! We had fun driving it, and were impressed with the 5 star crash ratings.  In todays economy, why spend more money for a name, when if you don't look at the emblem, you don't know this is a Nissan.","We loved the styling. Ours is black and with all the chrome, it looks as rich and classy as a BMW or Lexus.

It sucks down the recommended 93 octane like it is a sports car with a big engine. Oh wait, it is a sports car (4-doors) with a good sized engine. The ride is a little stiff but it is supposed to be like that. There are more bells and whistles that I can shake a stick at.

If you like to drive, this is a great car!",Push your foot into the pedal and it will let you know there is power there. The 18s and the suspension pull you through corner without effort. The interior is very comfortable and a please to be in for long periods. I don't have one favorite feature because there are too many to list!,GPS by Zenrin and Navteq is VERY outdated. Roads takes years to build but these two companies can't keep up and they get blindsided with new roads. There are POIs that are outdated by FOUR years! Don't buy GPS.

It's the first Nissan we've owned, and we couldn't be more pleased. I would HIGHLY recommend the Sport pkg. as it adds eye-popping 19in. rims, a spoiler, and fog lights, among several other amenities. It seems trivial, but I'd also recommend mud flaps as they add an extra piece of trim just behind the front & rear tires. (These aren't you dad's Pontiac Camero mud flaps.) Nissan engineers pulled-out the stops from the remarkably smooth CVT to the telescopic steering wheel and well-appointed leather interior.

Nissan has done many things right with this car. You need to drive the new Maxima to appreciate the ""Four Door Sports Sedan"" motto. From outside, it has very unique and appealing design (pictures do not tell the story - you need to see it).  Inside is full of technology which is very well integrated with the needs of the driver.  The ride comfort and power is amazingly well blended in the premium package.  Nissan raised the bar so high with this model that now they need to compete with a different class of cars.  I strongly recommend this generation of Maxima.  ","Excellent handling for a 290 HP front- wheel car. Maxima has the best CVT implemented in the market. Inside, the Bose stereo provides an amazing sound to multiple music sources. Excellent iPod integration.  High quality materials inside and out, including comfortable leather seats. Very quiet ride.","At this price point, Nissan engineers did their best.  A few things they need to take notice: Add a fog light ""on"" indicator on the dash (same problem was in previous model), update the software that shows the outside temperature in the dash board so that it is centered to the screen when displayed."

Also the brakes are always making noise and every time I take the car in they charge me $200 to change the brakes on a brand new car.

Mileage is also quite good for a car of this type.  My main complaint is that the ride comfort with the sport suspension and the low profile tires is extremely harsh and jittery on any road that is not reasonably smooth. And in my city in Ohio, smooth roads are in short supply. I know it is a sports sedan, but the engineers should have been able to design a more supple ride.

I purchased the SV with Premium & Technology packages. The car handles very well and rides comfortably in spite of the 18"" tires. The interior is inviting but has a mix of quality and inferior looking items. The plastic wood trim is somewhat of an eyesore and seems to detract from the numerous plush features. However, all of the other interior details make up for this shortcoming. The engine is very responsive and the CVT is seamless.

4.875,AZ First 2009 Maxima Buyer!,Srini ,07/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Luckily I happen to be the owner of the Arizona's first 2009 Nissan Maxima :) I have had it only couple of days, but gentlemen, this car is a treat. The ride is so much better than any earlier Maxima. Especially at turns, this cars gives a damn good feel. With 290HP, this cars is giving me 21MPG in city so far, which is only 2 days. Interior is much richer and I would rate it as better than Infinity G35. 3.5S comes standard with 8-way power seats (with manual lumber support), moon roof and 8 speaker audio system, steering wheel mounted audio controls, all of which are upgrades in other cars like Altima or Accord. Will come back with more reviews after I get to drive it for couple of weeks",1) The feel of the drive. 2) I love the exterior body shape and the way its hood and head lights are designed. 3) interior is pretty nice with better seats & better trim and console,I am no expert on this but from the drive in past couple of days I feel that the suspensions can be a little better to give more smoother ride when riding on bumps & ditches.

4.875,Just took delivery,KB ,07/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"While waiting for the Maxima's release, drove most all 6 cylinders, including G35, Acura TL, Toyota Avalon, Accord, etc. True sports car enthusiasts may not care for the front wheel drive, but the Maxima handles very well for an entry level luxury sedan with a sporty feel. Performs better and the convenience items are great. Got the SV w/Premium Package -- white w/tan interior. Looks great. Will be back to comment on fuel economy.  ","Dual sun roof, iPod interface with the monitor, back-up camera, sleek body lines. 290 horses accelerate very smoothly with the CVT. Premium package has very nice leather interior. Surprising room for this 6'1"" driver.","Would be nice to have iPod controls at the steering wheel, but this is minor."

5,Best Maxima Ever!,Nissaner ,07/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just picked up my Black on Black Maxima 3.5 SV. Got it with the sport package. A great car in and out ! The redesigned interior screams luxury, while the carbon trim and sport paddle shifters give it a sport look/feel. This car has all the toys! Bluetooth, navigation, heated seats, premium leather, etc. The CVT is smooth and the driving is great. The car is very spacious, even in the back. For the price, it beats the Acura TL easily and gives you  a lot more features than you can get in any German import. Car of the year!","Everything! Nissan has given back the ""flagship"" title to the new Maxima. It's fast, luxurious, packed with the latest technology, nice looks, all for a great price tag!",The inside door levers (handles) are made from painted plastic. It sort of takes away from the quality from the rest of the interior. Everything else is made from high grade and nothing feels cheap except the handles.
