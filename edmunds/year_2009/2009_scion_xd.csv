- has a clock","- when seats fold flat the gap is filled with a cheep
piece of cardboard, the gap should be filled with the seats and not a piece of cardboard. and go flat to the floor not raised up. (honda Fit has this) 

- ipod connecter should be USB and not a wired cord for the ipod. And the ipod should be able to be charged when you are connected to the Radio, it will not charge currently.
(Pionner has radios that do this) 

- add more adjustments to seat like a lumbar support, lumbar support adjustment, leg height adjustment, (Scion TC seats have leg adjust only on driver side). 

- add a telescoping steering wheel.
(toyota prius has this)

-add outside temp gage. (a lot of cars have this)"

The Fit was second in price and more mundane without the costly sport package.  After one year and 20,000 miles we couldn't be happier with our decision. In addition to exceeding all the above expectations, the xD is also fun to drive, has great std features we learned to love, great dealer service, and gets lots of positive attention because it doesn't seem to be as run of the mill as some the competitors.

There is plenty of room for a small car and the interior is well designed. The list of standard features is impressive.

The car looks small on the outside, but inside there is a lot more room than you'd expect. We did look at the Honda Fit, but liked the look and the wat the xD drove. Also, the local Honda dealer marked up the price of the Fit by $2500 over MSRP and unwilling to negotiate off that price. Glad we passed on the Fit.

First tank of gas averaged 37.6, mostly highway at 70-75 mph. Refueled, and then got 44 mpg at 60 mph on the highway, carrying 2 adults and 3 children. Very fun to drive, accelerates very quickly and nimble handling. Eye catching design and color. Was able to carry myself, 2 children, a dog, and a bike inside. A bit tight, but it worked. Yakima makes a roof mount bike rack for this car, and I will probably get that in the spring. So far, we are really enjoying the car.","Navigation with all the audio goodies. Great mileage.

I also drove the Honda Fit and Insight. Have 1,000 miles on xD now.  Overall, I am very pleased.  Decided at last minute to get the 5 speed manual. It was a great decision as I prefer controlling when shifts occur. The car has enough power for most situations.  The engine is very smooth and quiet.  Road noise is not an issue. The transmission shifts very well.  The handling is tight and the brakes are good. My gas mileage went from 18 mpg in the Windstar to 31 mpg (mostly to and from work) and I drive fairly aggressively   ",I like shifting the car best.  Mine has a nice (upgraded) stereo. I like the bright red paint and the bulldog appearance.  The spoiler makes it look a bit sportier.  ,"Don't roll either rear window down while driving.  Like most cars, it roars and buffets the interior.  I'd like another 20-30 HP but not at the expense of gas mileage. I had a couple of minor (factory problem) paint issues - touched up one.

For a small vehicle, you don't think it is small on the inside. I went from a Tundra to this and I am really impressed. Full height front seats are a real nice feature, though an upgrade fabric would have been even sweeter. Apparently there was a mistake at the factory, cause I actually got a High-Def radio made by Alpine in my XD and yet the catalog says it is only available on the XB's as an option.

It has more HP stock then a Mini Cooper (not S of course). The styling is unique, just the right amount of funkyness to get you noticed.

5,What a nice little rig!,Aggie*86 ,02/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Purchased for my 21 year old daughter after we looked at many other cars. She instantly fell in love. Excellent service from the sales personnel. This thing gets much better fuel mileage than her previous Focus and better than posted on the window sticker. 40 mpg (no kidding) on trip from Las Vegas to San Diego. Very nice interior. Lots of standard features. Power everything. This is a very attractive all around vehicle for the youth market. ,Awesome fuel mileage. Same engine as Toyota Corolla!,"Add automatic headlights. This thing has everything else ""power"", auto headlight feature would complete the package."
4.875,Fun in the New Look,Charlie M. ,02/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I just bought The 2009 XD Scion. It only gets better as you drive . The Fuel Economy is superb and the Pioneer sound system rocks.I looked at the Focus. I was sold on the XD. 15,800 for a fully loaded Automatic. I was looking for a manual But the dealer with the ""Fixed pricing"" cut a deal for a sure sale. I'm not in anyway sorry for this choice. I came out of a Sable full loaded with sound system to rock your socks off 0-60 in 5.5. For the price and performance and GAS MILEAGE,you cant go wrong.  It has pep like a V-6. Test drive one before you buy. You wont be sorry .Only down fall no center arm rest. Compartments everywhere.FUN TO DRIVE.... Oh yeah I wanted a sun roof like the sable .none ",Looks turn heads every where. gas mileage in out standing. Only $16.00 for a fill up. Pioneer rocks but the base could be improved with speakers in the cargo area.,CENTER ARM REST IS A MUST FOR LONG TRIPS .ADD TELESCOPING STEERING WHEEL!!!
5,A True Winner!,ATM ,01/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Test drove a leftover '08 Mazda3 and frankly found it kind of boring to drive. The Toyota dealership was right next door so I ran over and test drove the xD and found it much more fun, plus it had just as many features and better gas mileage... and less expensive! A great car is when the more you drive it, the more you like it, and this is one of those type of vehicles. Toyota has figured this out and they seem to know what the customer likes and how to deliver it. I just can't believe how solid this thing is built for the price. Not to mention it looks good, too. This is my first Toyota and I doubt it'll be my last. ","mp3 AUX input is nice, however the iPod connecter doesn't seem to give you full control to navigate. The 60/40 split rear seats and the fact that they fold down flat. Just great features for the price all around. Oh, bring on those high gas prices too!","Aforementioned iPod connection. Like others I wish it had an armrest, but I have found some aftermarket ones (with storage compartment) that might be a solution. Roof rack option.  Also, an AWD option would be great for this vehicle. "
4.875,Great choice,AZ ,12/23/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the car 3 months ago, after researching cars (mostly) in the same category (e.g., Honda Fit, Nissan Versa, Mitsubishi Lancer, Mazda 3). The two finalists were the Scion and the Honda... the Honda dealers' attitude (that I didn't like) and the Scion's ""pure price"" with a nice set of standard features tipped the decision in favor of the Scion. Soon after purchase, I made a 2000 mile trip with the car--a true test for it! It aced the test and I've been very happy with it after the trip as well.  Gear shifting is smooth and acceleration is awesome for this car category. Gas mileage is much better than advertised. Comfortable for me (5'8""), could improve for taller people.  ",MPG (I do a lot of city driving...) Size (as it relates to parking!) Standard features! Cargo space! Visibility (compared to other hatchbacks) ,"Taller people may have a problem with the comfort (the other driver of this car is 6'1"", and while he can adjust the seat to still have leg room, passengers suffer). I'd like to be able to plug in a musical device other than an iPod. Floor mats should be included in standard features "
4.75,Who Needs a MINI Cooper?,oleladyfanatic ,12/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"Downsizing in this economy has become a hobby of mine. While I could easily afford my 07 MIN Cooper, I did not relish the thought of the maintenance costs once she was out of warranty. $110.00 oil changes?  I've driven both Toyotas and Hondas for the past 25 years, and wanted to once again drive ""worry free"". After research and test drives of every compact car on the market, I easily chose the new Xd.  Amazing quality for $16,000! ",Build quality- impeccable Zippy handling Integrated Ipod controls on steering wheel Looks different than the norm Safety features Gas mileage Toyota quality Double glove boxes Little storage cubbies ,Automatic door locks Center arm rest Auto on headlights 16 inch alloys as standard 
4.875,"Great car, great price.",ellie ,12/23/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,After driving both the Honda Fit and the Scion xD I found the Scion xD more to my liking. First of all I like how high the car sits- I feel more comfortable and have a better view than in the Honda Fit. The xD handles well and has less wind noise than the Fit. The safety features are impressive and the car is comfortable to drive. In my opinion at several thousand dollars less it is a better bang for your buck than the Honda Fit.,"Gas mileage, safety features and standard options that are not included with other brands. This car is fun to drive!","Better placed cup holders. A center console for my CDs would be great. Otherwise, can't complain."
5,Good ride without the superfluous stuff,VA driver ,12/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Test drove Fit, Versa, Corolla, Camry, Civic. Liked the xD the best. Honda cars didn't respond well and the Versa didn't have a flat cargo space when the seats folded down. The xD responds right away when I push the gas. The manual transmission is geared better than the Fit's. I don't find the dials as hard to read as others say. The actual gas mileage is always less than the electronic meter on the car tells me it is, but I still get around 35 highway (~75mph) and easily 32 mixed. At lower speeds (~65mph) on the highway I've gotten higher. The cup holders are in weird places, usually low and not within reach without leaning. No armrest, but I don't feel like it needs one. Overall great car!",Radio and ipod hookups are pluses.  Lots of space and the back seats are very comfortable (says my passengers).  Front seats are also supportive - I have a bad back (herniated disk) but had no problems after a 6 hour drive. Gas mileage (saving money never goes out of style)! Price was lower than Fit,"Others have suggested hookups for other than iPod.  It has an AUX hookup, so I don't know what else they're looking for.  Better location of cupholders, less road noise, change the way the shoulder strap of rear middle seat hooks to ceiling, lumbar support in driver's seat"
5,Awesome value,Paul ,12/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is better than I expected.  I needed a gas-saving four door with room to carry dogs and sometimes haul bikes, skis and kayaks.  And something fun to drive was part of the deal.  I got the 5 speed and this car is a blast to drive.  It pulls well with a wide power band - don't have to strain the motor much.  Quality is superb.  Handling is crisp.  I'm getting 36 mpg on the highway, about 30 overall.  For a car at this price, it is a great buy.  The care comes with a bunch of standard features.  I'm very happy with it.","Seating position, roominess, ""fun to drive"" factor, gas mileage, integrated ipod stereo interface and great standard sound system.  Lots of standard features.",An armrest would be nice.
5,Great Car For The Money!,Mike Sanchez ,11/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Over all I've been very impressed with my 2009 xD. I'm a little less than two years out of college and it has been an excellent car for the money. I never thought of myself ever driving a Scion as they tend to be a little quirky looking, some could argue juvenile, but that's what gives it personality.  Over all car handling, acceleration, reliability, residual value retention, over all performance, and many awards has made it a reassuring purchase.  I've heard of negative comments about the paint job, road noise, etc but the optional sound deadening package, luster paint finish, etc (Vehicle Shield Protection)  makes quite the improvement. ","The standard features! Also, the Toyota Corolla engine, suspension, etc gives more bang for the buck. Great MPG! Also, it's extremely customizable and comfortable! The Honda Fit just doesn't compare especially in regards to comfort. I have the optional Pioneer sound package and it's well worth it!  ","Blind spots! Get bubble mirrors to add to the side mirrors! Could use more cargo space but it is after all a sub-compact. More head room too would be nice.  Side note- As far as customizing, purchasing OEM parts (ebay) and hiring someone to install is easy and will save you 1/3 the dealership cost."
5,Love this xD!,MJ ,10/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have only had it for a few days but love it.  I did a great deal of research (for years) before deciding on a vehicle.  This one had the most to offer for the price plus the looks, cannot beat that!","looks, fuel economy, price & value, etc.",automatic headlights
3.875,Be Careful of the Paint,R. Voss ,10/23/2008,,,4,1,4,4,,4,4,5,5,Our 2009 Scion XD has terrible paint. It is Nautical Blue and it is defective and scratches at the rub of your finger. Make sure you look at the paint before you take the car off the lot.,Great mileage and sporty style,"Noisy ride, I would like to plug in other music devices besides an Ipod"
5,Worth the wait,Goog49 ,10/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was replacing a '98 Civic Hatchback.  Desperately needed Cruise Control because of my commute. Also needed Traction Control because of the snow we get here.  Test drove the xD, Nissan Versa, Toyota Yaris and Honda Fit.  The cargo area in the Versa wasn't suitable for my dogs, the Yaris would only accommodate aftermarket Cruise Control, and the Fit's seat was very uncomfortable, at least for me.  It took a few weeks to get the color and options I wanted.  Gas mileage in the mid 30's, so far.  Nice acceleration and overall ride. Interior nicely laid- out. Quirky exterior look, but just fine to me!  ",Appearance (distinctive!).  Lots of standard features.  Toyota reliability (anticipated).  We've had spectacular luck with this make!  ,"I wish the steering wheel telescoped.  I have to reach out for it, or move the seat way forward and cramp my legs.  I'm 5'11"". Wish it had an easier-to- reach coin/token bin. It accommodates a 6-footer, but I get the idea it was designed for a smaller person.  "
3.625,Paint problem,Lynn L. ,10/14/2008,,,5,5,2,3,,3,4,4,3,We love the car so far technically. We are having problems with the paint (nautical blue). It scratches at the touch of a finger and it looks dimpled. We are wondering if anyone else has encountered this problem. We have had the car for only 1 month and it gets worse and worse as the days go by. There also is a spot of discoloration in the front right panel of the car.,"We love the Ipod hook up, the gas mileage and the get up and go with the manual transmission. The car is very roomy even in the back seat.",The seats are a bit hard and it is very noisy. There is a lot of road noise. I would like to see an adapter for other music devices besides Ipod. Not everyone has an Ipod.
4.875,Cute!,Darcie ,10/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love the new Scion xD. It is exactly what I need. I bought it after totaling my '03 Jeep Liberty. Needless to say, the gas mileage is a little better. ",The exterior design is one of my favorite features but it's also really cute inside. The controls are in the center above the steering wheel. I like this - you don't have to search. ,"Include the floor mats!!! Seriously, that's kinda cheap. Also I think that the cup holders could be higher. I miss having a center console to lean on also.

4.375,Worth the Wait,Mick ,10/07/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,5,5,"I ordered my car the beginning of June and had to wait 3 months for the color I wanted but well worth the wait. I had test drove the Kia Spectra, Nissan Versa and the Xd. I have a SUV also.  When on Edmunds, I fell over the review for the Xd and I am so glad I did.  After reading multiple reviews I test drove and ordered all in the same day.  This car is peppy, much faster than what I would have thought and great on the gas mileage.  I no longer get a stomach ache when pulling up to the gas station.  I have had it for one month and am averaging 36-38 MPG with about 75% freeway each day. Very happy with my choice.  She is so dang cute with her rear spoiler !",I like that my left arm rests comfortably on the door rest. The heat/air controls are handy so no reaching to adjust. The seat fits my body well and sits up high. Mileage is great. Was able to fit a 7ft piece of trim through the middle. Great no hassle price. ,"Don't miss not having the arm rest  but could use the storage for glasses, etc.  Cup holder in front is too far forward.  Hard to read clock, Blue lights would be easier to read than red. Outside temp gauge. Radio not as nice as expected, need bigger dials & sound.Door handle too far back inside."
5,Fun little car.,F.W. ,10/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought it as a replacement for my wife's Olsmobile Alero.  This really is a great little car.  Lots of pep, the handling is great, gas mileage is phenomenal, features are fantastic, and it looks like a little monster in a good way.  I researched these small style cars for about two months now and it came down to a toss up between the Honda Fit Sport and the xD.  Thankfully the xD comes in one base model and comes fully loaded vs the Fit, which you have to spend the extra cash for the Sport to get the same features.  Granted the Fit has a little more cargo space, but for price (Pure Pricing), reliability, style, features and peppier engine, xD all the way.  No regrets, we love this car.","Nice engine, car style, gas mileage, extra bells and whistles, 16'' wheels, and stereo (plus MP3 player hookups)",Little more leg room and cargo space.

It has plenty of power, handled the hills and curves of W. Virginia great. The size is great really easy to reach everywhere to wash. No chips or dings in paint after the trip, does seem to catch the bugs on front but my husband said my Buick did too I just never noticed. He's probably right.The gas mileage was excellent 31 in the hills, 36 though N. Carolina. Around home it's about 33 mpg. mix of city and highway. Great fun to drive. Controls are all easy to reach. Does have a small blind spot, check twice. I am in love, the dog and husband are jealous.","Only feels like a small car when I'm parking it. Standard 16 inch tires.

5,Super fun 2nd Family Car,SoCal Driver ,09/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Needed a 2nd car for all my kid pick- ups and drops.  Our Suburban has a severe drinking problem and is in rehab.  Looked and researched every car in this category. It was between the xD and the Fit.  The xD was $2k less than the similarly equipped Fit and the fit/finish and engine performance was much, much better as well.  Also, the Honda dealers came across as very snotty about the Fit, not my thing.  Didn't notice any difference between the manual and auto when testing.  Handles amazingly well.  Feels sporty and luxurious inside.  Great on the hwy as well as our rural roads.  MPG - solid 31 city (hilly and curvy) and 38 highway.  Will be the kids' car in 2 yrs and they love it.","Fit and finish, simply the best in the class.  Standard options and fun gadgets available to accessorize.

4.875,Great Little Car,Jim ,09/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"We bought our Scion two weeks ago and are really love it.  It has more power than we need, is comfortable, build quality is superb, and gas mileage is also really good.  We've only gone through one tank of gas so the following numbers may be not be real accurate.  However, the calculated mileage was 31.5 mpg while the computer average said it would be 32.9 mpg.  We live in the Sierra Foothills and go up and down 1,000 to 2,000 feet and that cuts into our mileage.  Our driving is probably 70% highway and 30% up and down.  On the highway, I believe we are exceeding 40 mpg when ""straight and level"" if the computer is accurate within 2 mpg.   ","Fun to drive, good gas mileage, great fit and finish, tons of features.","This car like most small cars sits very, very close to the ground, inches away.
