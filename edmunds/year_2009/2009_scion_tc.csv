4,My first ever car purchase..& I would do it again!,Caitlin Martin ,03/23/2016,5,3,4,,,5,5,4,5,,,"I bought my 2009 Scion tC used in 2013 with about 60k miles on it. Since owning it and now at over 124k miles I have never had to put any money to it besides your typical maintenance; oil changes, wipers, new tires! It literally is like indestructible, it has never given me issues. Even in the snow, I live in northern New Jersey and with just my typical all weather tires, I can get through the snow pretty well with taking my time. This honestly is the best car a young person can buy, I certainly got my moneys worth from it. The only thing I can complain about is the acceleration. It has the sporty look to it but drives more like an economy car, so its a little deceiving. Gas mileage is pretty good. But all in all, a great overall vehicle, VERY RELIABLE! It will be a sad day when I have to let her go to get into something a little bigger, but until that day comes I enjoy having the pleasure to have an awesome car that will do me good in the meantime.",,

Although I appreciate the Toyota reputation for reliability, this car needs to offer more for the price tag. There's nothing really sporty about this car, and the 25 MPG that I get now does not impress me. If you are looking for a cute car that is fun to drive and the price is reasonable, and you don't care about the drawbacks I posted, then go for it. It's reliable. If not, you can get more car for the money, if you go with something more traditional. If you are hunting for a sports car, the Scion will not satisfy you (especially with an automatic)","- Toyota reliability
- Great looks
- 2.4 peppy engine","The cons:
- Automatic is a 4-speed (Camrys have a 5-speed with the same engine for the same year line)
- Road noise
- Averages at 25-26 MPG
- Not really a sports car
- Very few features (pretty much just basics)
- Overall not enough bang for a buck
- Weird headlight on/off management (we got stranded a couple of times when my wife exited the passenger door instead of the driver door)"
4.625,First Car,reyest ,07/18/2013,,,4,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,The 09 Scion TC was my first car i bought. I had always liked them so i figure why not get one. I believe i was too anxious when buying this car and didn't look at more options. I love my car but just wish it was less quiet. Seems like when your on the highway it's just really loud. It's a really fun car to drive and picks up speed pretty quick. I guess the only thing that bothers me is that it's just loud on the hwy so if could change anything it would be that. Other than that overall an amazing car. My next car will defiantly be a larger Vehicle possibly a 4dr or a truck. Also not bad on gas as well. ,"Stock rims,body style, ",

I think this car has a bad reputation in some circles because there are too many Tc owners that think this is a sports car. It's not. Test drove an auto but bought the manual for price reasons. Auto was a little slow to shift but other than that it was fine. The car handling is excellent, it feels like you are driving the car not the other way around. A lot of the electronic assist stuff Toyota loves to put in their cars now is pleasantly absent in the TC give you the feeling of having more control over your driving experience. Fuel economy, torque and HP is what you would expect from a 2.4 L 4 cylinder.","Handling, loads of standard features, surprising leg room (6'2"" and I fit just fine), fit and finish is better than many other cars in this price range.

4.5,wow,lilj89 ,09/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,3,5,Very impressed with the tc I love the sound system and how quick it accelerates when you downshift I love the  sunroof and the reclining back seats (even though I'm never in the back LOL) on thing I was a little disappointed on was the fuel economy for a 4 cylinder the fuel economy was not what I expected but all in all it is a great car.

I drove 3 hours to pick it up and what I found upon arrival was nothing short of what I expected. Beauty is in its simplicity and somewhere in its simplicity is a hidden power that I do love. It's sporty, with a back seat! Everything this 22 year-old single father will ever need. Kudos to Scion!","Hatch, but without looking like a hatch! I can fit my guitar, some small luggage in the hatch, my kid in his carseat in the back and still turn heads on the street.","I had to get a manual so there is a few things that aren't as smooth as they should be between the clutch and transmission, mainly noise but I'm lookin into a quickshifter so maybe that will resolve my problem."

Here are my pros and cons:  I have already logged over 10k miles on my car without a single problem.  The back moonroof shade will rattle if you drive on the hgwy w/ the windows down (to be expected)  Scion cut costs on the frame, but if you can do that and still score 5 star safety ratings, who wouldn't?  my tires' tread is already getting low. I'll be lucky if they last 10K more miles  it's not very quick.. at least not with a manual.  1st is done early compared to other light-weight cars  interior could use a quality boost","Able to control Ipod with the steering wheel, sound system, sunroof, and I found the suspension to be quite respectable..  I don't rev to the redline, but I do drive like a maniac at times, and it handles rather well","Let's see:  more power, better quality, improved gas milage..  but most of these upgrades would result in a higher MSRP.   I test-drove the civic SI.  it's nasty. but it also STARTS at $5000 more than the Tc. That's a severely basic model. The one I drove was 27k. TC: best for the $"

I have owned allot of cars over the years and I usually get bored with them after a few months, but not my tC.  This car has the necessary power, style and comfort to keep you coming back for more.  I really like that Toyota did the first two scheduled maintenance services for free.  The car is put together well and offers a spacious sleek design for a coupe.  I went from driving a truck to my tC and I haven't missed my truck, aside from the occassional need to haul something big.  I got the optional Nav system which was a bit pricey but worth the money.",Sound system with Navigation (Big touch screen)is excellent.  Plays DVD's too!! Moon/sun roof is great and I loved the reclining back seats.  The optional body kit sets off its sleek design and the Pearl white paint is beautiful.  Looks even better with my dark tinted windows..,My biggest disappointment was that the Nav system isn't bluetooth compatible for syncing my cellphone.  You would think that the price of that upgrade would include that feature.  Gas mileage could be a little better but I have a heavy foot at times so that may be mostly my fault.

This car handles great in the winter. We had a pretty bad winter this year and I had no problems with it's handling. Much better than what I had before. More room in the back then what you'd think for passengers who sit in the rear. Car stayed on track in the snow and when ABS kicked in it stopped. Ipod hookup is awesome in this car, better than a lot of Pioneer aftermarkets out there right now. Car looks great on the outside, I get a lot of stares and comments. Roomy interior, but the build quality could be better.","I love the sound system, well worth the money to upgrade. Love the two moon roofs even though the backseat one doesn't open. Drives nice in the city. AC works great, it gets nice and cold for hot days.","Cost to upgraded features is expensive, XM from dealership is out of this world.

Basic model features are great.  Moonroof/sunroof is awesome,I love it.  The only this is that it's a little rattly at times.  I put a spoiler on the car, so I just found out I can't put a rack on the back, but that is a minor issue.  If you are looking for a small, fun, sporty, nice looky car with a smooth ride, this is perfect for you.",Stereo is great.  Smooth drive.  Moon/sun roof.,"Gas mileage.  I have a heavy foot at times so I get 24 mpg.  However if the foot isn't so heavy (rare occasion) I get up  to 29 mpg.

Driving experience, the shifter is kind of high and the armrest usually hits my elbow;shifting, ""biggest complaint"". The gauges could been a little bigger. The suspension is horrible! Other than that it is a pretty smooth and quiet car, plenty of torque. I would think that Toyota could have done more with the 09 model. Basically if you really want experience your tC, you would defenitely need TRD upgrades. The tc is really not up there with the civic SI or cobalt SS.

The car looks wonderful, inside and out, even considering I don't like the other Scion models.","The sunroof and moonroof are excellent. The iPod connector comes in handy, allows me to change songs using the steering wheel controls.

After getting the diagnosis I looked it up and apparently this has been a problem on and off since 2005.  I am hoping that the fix will resolve the issue permanently and that this isnt an ongoing thing.

The sound is awful you can't turn it up with out it crackling the speakers. After breaking the car, in it just feels so cheap. I want out of this thing and back into a Civic, worst mistake of my life is buying this car. I thought Toyota was quality. ",the only feature is an i-pod connection,"everything, not very fuel efficient when compared to everything else in its class. The sound is awful, it's noisy. rattles to much, etc."
4.875,Almost Perfect,lesslinger ,08/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My first Scion and I am not disappointed. This car has a lot of torque for a 4cyl and moves pretty fast. I would say that the fuel economy is rather low for a 4 cyl and notice that on the freeway, i ride at around 3,000 rpm constantly. Maybe a 5 gear for automatic would have been a good option for the fuel economy. Also, when you gas it for speed, it doesn't take off right away, but does build up speed very fast. Love the moon roofs, and just the over all feel. Other thing I notice is at 70 mph, on freeway, I hit a bad patch of road that made my car feel like it was bouncing. Not a big deal, but was very noticeable. Over all I love it.","Stereo, Torque, look and feel. Seriously, just about everything.","Freeway driving lowering rpm, maybe adding 5th gear, More response when gassing, and better MPG. Come on, it a 4 cyl."
5,Great Little Car,Debbie ,06/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The steering is tight as a sports car. It handles great with a lot of get up and go.  Excellent sound system.  I love the color - Sizzling Crimson. A lot of people ooohed and aahhhed as it was driven off the showroom floor. With minimum down, I still had great low payments.",Stereo & steering,Power seats would be nice
4.5,Lots of fun and solid value,Devedander ,06/09/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"After a rather long process I picked up my 09 TC and am very happy with pretty much everything about it.  The basic stereo sounds quite decent and the tiny sub actually does a decent job of filling in the lows. Make sure to hold the SSP button for 5 seconds and change the mode from Tc (xB sounded best to me).  The car feels plenty strong for normal driving and takes hills happily.  Only cons I can think of so far are that the steering wheel sits a bit low (or the seat is high) and sits a bit too far forward so either it's a bit far from you or the pedals are too close.  The clutch also has unusually long travel which is a bit odd.  Overall I am very happy, looks and drives great!",Stereo door to hide upgrade HU; hidden ipod connector in armrest; dual sunroof; engine immobilizer,Add 6th gear for better mileage; lengthen 1st gear; give more buttons to steering wheel radio controls; shorten clutch travel; make stereo door automatic on power
