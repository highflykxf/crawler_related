2,"Buyer Beware! The Good the Bad, & The Ugly",MajesticGent ,06/14/2016,2,2,3,,,1,4,4,3,,,"I will start this review off stating that the North Carolina Consumer Council urges people to stay away from this vehicle: http://www.carcomplaints.com/news/2016/dont-buy-nissan-pathfinder-frontier-xterra.shtmlIf you're looking to purchase a used Frontier it is imperative to look out for two costly failures. They start occurring around the 100k mark. I will list them from most to least expensive.1. Coolant leaks in the transmission fluid. Bring a ratchet with an extension and a 10mm socket to remove the bolt and check the transmission fluid. The dipstick isn't easy to find, so Google it and you'll see where to locate it. If the transmission fluid is pink, or has the look and consistency of Pepto Bismol, the transmission will fail, and the radiator will need to be replaced. Estimated cost to repair at Nissan dealership = $3500 - $60002. Listen for the timing chain tensioner failure.  After starting the engine pop open the hood and listen to area where the timing chain is near, also if you can have someone rev it up a few times to see if you hear the whine; if you hear a whining sound, similar to an remote controlled car moving, then timing chain tensioner has failed and the timing belt will eventually get too loose and destroy the engine. All of the timing chains and tensioners will need to be replaced. Estimated cost to repair at Nissan dealership = $1700 - $2000 if ignored and the timing chain fails you will need a rebuilt engine estimated cost ??? (thousands)The radiator/transmission issues can be avoided by rerouting the lines that run from the radiator to the transmission directly into the transmission cooler, but a better solution is to install an external transmission cooler bypassing the radiator altogether; this way coolant will never have a chance to enter the transmission even if the radiator fails, or leaks occur.If you've made it this far that means you still have interest in the vehicle so I'll continue with my review of actually owning the truck.The Good: Up until 100k the truck was sound mechanically. Had no major issues. The truck accelerates very nicely. The performance is great, and the ride is even more solid when you have a load. I have never towed with it, but the towing capacity is pretty good for a light truck. The A/C gets cold quickly, the heat sometimes acts up and doesn't want to heat until moving, but eventually that goes away. The bed size is great, I've hauled some pretty nice size loads in the thing and I've rarely had issues with not having enough space. I liked the look of this truck over the others in the class at the time. The king cab gives you enough room to store groceries, or have a small child in the back. I've had adults squeeze back there but I would not recommend it. The truck handles well, with the exception of the turning radius. The truck stops when you press on the brakes, and they will get spongy if you don't keep up on them, but even then it will stop abruptly. With that being said this truck is fun to drive and performs very well.The Bad: The Bridgestone trail rated tires that come with the truck are useless on wet pavement and makes the ride quality horrible. I replaced with Michelin tires, I can't recall the rating, but it changed the traction, handling, and ride quality dramatically! The turning radius isn't the greatest. I've wondered how heavy trucks can outturn my truck, at first I thought it was my driving skills, but after driving other trucks; I realized that it's the Frontier with a sad turning radius. You will have to get used to this and swing out on turns, and U-Turns in the thing are terrible at best. Good luck driving this truck, rear wheel drive, in the snow/ice without some kind of weight on the back of the bed. This probably holds true with most rear wheel vehicles, but I'm just pointing it out for people in snowy climates.The Ugly: I started noticing this weird whining sound, and rough start whenever I would crank up the car. The truck would rock when I started it up. I was due for a tune up, so after getting that done the rock went away a little, but the whine was still there. I started doing research and I saw that Nissan issued a service bulletin about the timing chain tensioner issues. Took it to the Nissan dealership the service tech said I need a new timing chain $1900. I did more research and found out that this has been an issue since the 2005 Frontiers and that I missed the boat on getting this fix done under warranty, at this point I was pissed because I was never aware of this issue until after the warrant before it happened! Went to another mechanic that fixed it for 10 hours labor & parts for $1700. Now I'm looking to bypass the radiator and get an external transmission cooler to prevent myself from possibly having to purchase a new transmission and radiator. Just know, Nissan is on the bottom of reliability and customer satisfaction rankings for a reason.",,

5,Little BIG truck!,rd ,08/21/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"AWESOME !  This is without a doubt the best truck for the buck I've owned since I bought my first Toyota in 1982.  What those trucks did for Toyota this truck should do for Nissan. I read that the output of this 6-cyl was near the F-150 and I had towed with the F-150 (22 ft Boston Whaler Dauntless), so I bought it. It pulls her out of the ramp in the snow and ice we get here in Montana, 4-wheels the mountains and gets over 20 MPG if I don't go over 70 MPH.  It does a whole lot better on premium and lousy if you put in alcohol contaminated gasoline.  I know that because I took this truck across country towing a smaller boat. Geared right for whatever you want a truck to do.","I thought the hill button was a joke when I bought the rig...now I use it all the time. Like the heated seats, tie downs in bed, the way the back seats fold up,  hell I love everything about this truck except that it can't fly",Shift-able automatic.  I wish NISSAN made this truck in a turbo diesel with enough power to pull and good road economy .... or make a diesel for the Titan and blow everyone else out of the pond!

3,Horrible Truck,Larry McEnnis ,04/24/2010,,,2,4,3,4,,4,1,5,1,"Possibly the worse vehicle I've every owned? All of the companies that write reviews for this truck want to praise it, then why didn't I get the same truck they rave about?  The front suspension is horrible.  It will not drive straight on the pavement, it wonders from side to side, and heaven forbid if you hit a pothole as it will throw the truck sideways.  And talk about bump steer, I've never experianced a truck whose steering wheel yanks to the side when you hit a bump.  The steering will flat wear you out if you take it on a dirt road.  It will want to pull the wheel side to side with every bump.  I have owned trucks for 40 years and this is the worse.  I can't wait to sell it.","Good looking, good power, and good gas mileage.","Fix the front end suspension!  Part of the problem might be the overly large sway bar, as this will transmit every bump into the whole vehicle."

I looked at the Dakota and the Tacoma, and wasn't very impressed. First, I liked the look of the Frontier. But, when I drove one, that was it. The power, felt like a V-8. Too me, it was just what I wanted in a truck. ","I like the dash lights at night, it's different. The radio and CD player is great. I like the back seats, they aren't the bench type. I like the four tie down eyes in each corner of the bed. The transmission and V-6 engine, are flawless. ","The arm rest is too short. The turning radius requires some getting use to, doesn't turn as sharp as what I'm used to."

OE tires are mediocre for snow and mud, but do fine on dry roads: disappointing to need new tires since I live in an area that has snow 4- 5 months. Surprised that neither the salesman or sales manager knew that this truck does have a break in period.  More truck for the price than I could have gotten a Toyota for.  Radio works well, even in fringe reception areas.  Radio and heater controls are easy to reach and understand.","Very comfortable on long trips, lots of room and good storage in the cab.  Excellent heat and AC.  Easy to handle and great visibility.","If I had known that you cannot put tire chains on all 4 wheels before buying, would have looked elsewhere. A 4x4 truck that can only use limited clearance chains on the rear and no chains on the front is a real disappointment.  My next truck will have room for standard chains all around."

I mainly needed a truck for work & my two main criteria were confort & reliability. I had originally been looking for a Toyota Tacoma, but for the price of my Frontier I would of got an '06 Tacoma with a lot more miles on it.  After driving my Frontier for 2 weeks now I am happier than ever. The truck is very comfortable for me (6'4"") & performs great! It feels like a big truck, while keeping smaller dimensions. Looks very aggressive & rides like a car. every time my wife gets in it she comments on how comfortable it is!  Hands down a better value than a Tacoma, much more bang for your buck!","Exterior styling, Nice wheels, nice interior with very comfortable seats, Super smooth ride, Rides like a car but is very capable in rough terrain.

Bigger than my 1995 Tacoma so I'm getting used to tighter turning radius. Did cash for clunker & couldn't get Toyota.

I love this truck.  Its rugged, and can take a beating.  After a few rough off-road sessions and about 20k miles, the suspension loosened up a little more than I would have liked, but I should have bought the Pro 4X, which I am going to do now that my truck has been totaled in an accident.  Which is another reason I love this truck, it took a 60 mph head on collision with a utility trailer & truck when they came into my lane from the other direction.  I walked away, but the truck was totaled, but the important thing is it saved me.

I took my truck in to the local Az Nissan dealer to have the oil changed and to check the condition of the brakes.  I also wanted them to check the driver's side sun visor because it seemed loose and does not stay against the windshield.  When I went to pick up the truck, the service manager told me that these conditions were observed with other like vehicles on the lot and that the condition was considered as being normal. If you purchase one of these 2009 Frontiers and expect the dealer to ""fix"" these conditions, think again. They were no help at all.","Other than the conditions stated above, I love my truck.  It looks great and runs great. If it were not for the two conditions above, I would highly recommend the 2009 Nissan Frontier to friends and family.

4.5,Love it!,JCG ,05/26/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I miss the fuel economy of my old 1993 Mazda B2200 but the smooth, quiet ride and great acceleration on the highway are so much better than the Mazda ever was and I got a great deal.  This truck is also fun to drive with very little road noise.  It takes a little while to get used to the quick response when turning the steering wheel.  I may change my tune if gasoline hits $4.00 per gallon again but right now i'm extremely pleased with my purchase.","Roomy interior, quiet ride, comfortable seats.",Put small amount of chrome trim on sides and a pocket to hold sunglasses in the overhead.
4.875,HAPPY OWNER,EONAVYCB ,05/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just bought the SE king cab 4x4 a few days ago.  I have been a dodge dakota owner the past few years, and this truck is 10 times better.  The cab is quiet, the truck is very tight, and very fun to drive.  I have also got several positive comments from others about the lokks and design.  I am looking forward to many years of service from this wonderful truck. ","body style, 6 foot bed, rugged appearance, 16 inch tires.",seats could be a bit more comfortable.
4.875,Fits just right,Jason ,05/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just got this truck after spending the past 5 years driving an Explorer Sport, and I have to say, there's a world of difference.  Was challenging finding the PRO-4X in 4wd, but I'm glad I held out for the PRO-4X. Not needing a full size truck, but desiring tough off-rode performance, and comfort, the PRO-4x fits my needs perfectly.  The ride is much better than my Explorers, with the 8-way adjustable (and heated) seats being the most comfortable I've experienced personally. I drove 5 hours in it the day I bought it, and never got ""tired of the saddle.""  The Rockford Fosgate sound system is top notch, and the Crew Cab gives me ample room to haul the kids around comfortably.   ",Utili-trac system. Entire PRO-4x off-road package Bluetooth capabilities.,Gas mileage isn't the best (but no worse than similar size trucks) Temp/Compass feature requires rearview mirror upgrade.
4.875,Toyota overrated,Mark ,05/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have owned 3 Tacoma's. satisfied with all 3, although very pricey and sparse inside. After much research and comparison, I am pleased with decision to buy 2009 Pro 4X, crew cab. Biggest factor, interior and price much better with Nissan. Finally, a comfortable truck with features never found in a truck. Heated leather, 6 disc/MP3, power seats and so on. The best compromise I could find between SUV and truck.","Power/heated Leather seats, stereo system, factory sprayed bed liner w/ cargo hooks/tracks, wheels and tires. Off road capability, while excelling in creature comforts.",Gas mileage will hurt if prices go back up. Steering a little heavy for city driving.
4.75,Proud Nissan Owner,Bert ,04/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I've only owned this truck for a month but extremely satisfied.  Fun to drive, attractive, and roomy for 4 average size people.  Fuel economy 16 around town, 21 highway.  After thorough research, glad I choose the Frontier over Tacoma.  Pros & Cons below.","Power/Acceleration/Transmission. Storage compartments, utilitrack and bed liner.  Disk brakes. Ride Height.",Turn radius.  Sound system is mediocre at best.  Arm rest on right side would be nice. Compass/Temp gauge. MP3 jack.
4.25,frontier,tennessee fan ,03/14/2009,,,4,5,5,4,,5,4,3,4,Truck looks good with good v6 power response. channel tie downs are great and will come in handy. hoping MPG will improve with break-in. vehicle is tight and doors fit good. there seems to be some oversteer on the hwy driving. transmission shifts good. would rather see electric engine coolins fans than the direct engine driven cooling fan. ,,oil filter/oil pump is an odd set up. the oil filer is not easy to get to and it leaves a mess went changing. the oil pump and oil lines are awful small. the arm rest on the front doors are not comfortable. the elbow drops into the arm rest cut out that is used to close the door. 
4.625,First Impression,JJS ,11/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"I am quite pleased with this truck.  I was open minded towards purchasing any brand and type of truck.  I chose the Frontier for several reasons:  Good build quality; metal where you normally see plastic and good fit. Smoothest shifting I've ever seen, especially into and out of 4WD. Name brand tires.  Power; (V6) plenty of it with decent fuel economy. Not too big, not too small; perfect size for someone who doesn't live in their truck. Drives very well; confident handling and feel. Overall great truck I think. Assembled in USA. Don't be fooled, you can't have someone in the back for any long period of time in King Cab but I'm ok with that. Oil filter a little hard to get to. ",Power. Utilitrack and bed liner from factory is awesome if you think you'll need it. Size is great. Fantastic transmission and 4WD shifting!,"I think the Utilitrack system should come standard. Currently it is an option. At a dealership, you may have to choose a pink truck because the black one you want doesn't have the utilitrack system you are almost certainly going to use or want. Too new otherwise to complain about anything else."
