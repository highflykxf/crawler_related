In 3 months we bought 2, and they both had so many mechanical problems the dealer had to buy them back. I did not even own the 2nd one for 2 weeks when the engine blew up and all of the electronics melted. The 1st one has vibration problems that Dodge said was normal. The check engine light was always coming on and it was misfiring in the cylinders. Both of these cars were a complete nightmare. They get great gas mileage because they are always on the back of a tow truck!",The interior was nice and it had a very clean look to it.,Everything!

Its spacious, load stuff in, go on long trips, go off road (Desert), seriously lets see a mustang or camaro do this. 5.7l V8 is simply crazy and on the freeway the fuel consumption is nothing!

If you want a big, burly, unapologetic All-American car (yeah I know it was built in Canada, but still) that shoots a middle finger to any sort of political or social correctness, this is your car. With its lowered stance, wide tires, deep front air dam and raised rear spoiler, it has the looks that strike fear in small children - yet can still fit 4 adults comfortably (5 if you squeeze) with all their luggage and a soft enough ride for a nice long road trip. Try that in a Camaro or a Mustang - it ain't happenin'!  ","The 6.1 L Hemi with its bellowing dual exhausts - when all its 425 horses are summoned to duty, releases a sound that is absolutely intoxicating.  And you'd better know exactly where you're going when doing so, because you're gonna get there VERY quickly. The MyGig option is highly recommended.","Wish gas MPG could be better, but it's just the nature of the beast, and it's not unreasonable considering the performance.

4.75,Great Car!,Rich ,04/03/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Shopped for weeks and test drove a lot of different models. My wife loves the way it drives, the seat comfort and seating position. We feel it was by far the best value for the dollar. Currently we get 24 to 27 MPG on the highway, with the RT hemi V8. Don't believe everything the ""Biased"" Toyota/Honda Consumer reports Mag. says. These are good cars.

So far it has been everything I anticipated it to be and more.  I'm not a drag racer and I know a little something about cars to go with the 3.5 V-6 HIGH-OUTPUT at least.  All around the board this is the car for me.  My kids will get this car and still be cool and safe.  I was a little hesitant about the rear wheel thingy, but I found that if I just respect the vehicle, it will definitely return the favor. This is definitely my soul mate.","My favorite feature is the SMOOTH ride even with the weight of the car itself, is just awesome.  Everything is postioned just right for me. The added safety features are excellent.","All the safety features that are only on the SXT and higher should be on even the base models, due to the rear wheel drive."

4.125,Decent after some modifications,Jim ,01/09/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,5,4,4,4,"I bought this car for looks and performance. The 5 issues I have are the tires (Continental tires feel like Flintstone's), the driver seat height, steering stiffness, fuel pump whine, and no MDS indicator. After replacing the plastichrome wheels with real chrome & buying Michelin's, the ride is more smoother & looks much better with real chrome. I had to buy a car performance computer to show MDS, but it works great. The only other probs are fuel pump whine, which they claim is normal (it's really not), and I feel like I sit too high. I always want to adjust the steering wheel another inch or so lower, but it won't go. I think the black looks best just coz it matches the black trim.","Speed, torque, straight launch when flooring it, back seat. I got it fully loaded, so the heated seats are nice, & nav. is decent. I love the masculine design. As with other reviewers, I also get a lot of looks & compliments :)","A lot of cars are doing this, but there are no under dash floor lights and no glove box light! That's just sad to skimp on those areas. Better quality materials, and I would have paid extra for an SRT hood option since it looks so much meaner. Now I'll have to buy one myself for $2,000. :("

This was a rental but I got a great price ($16,400) with only 29k miles.  Some things are a hit while others are a miss. Pros: Styling (these with 22"" rims and tint look awesome!), reliability, available features (not saying the one I got had any of them), price, size (hate small cars), rear wheel drive, interior which appears very easy to keep clean but is cheap plastic (good compared to other things that rip, weather). Cons: fueling cuts off during fill up because of tank design, cloth seats are uncomfortable- lumbar hits in upper back/ headrest is too far forward, no programmable seat positioning, weird key fob ","style, engine choices, rear wheel drive, size, reliability","Add programmable seating, change seat design (make more comfortable), change fuel filler design so pumping doesn't force manual filling, make auto-on headlights standard, get rid of new key/fob design or at least make it smaller, come with 22"" rims :) "

It handles like a champ on all roads. After removing the Goodyear RS-As, my wet traction wet up. As far as gas mileage goes, it's better than I thought. I'm getting over 19 miles a gallon overall. But a 2-ton, 425HP vehicle is not bought for fuel conservation.  Now for style. Turning heads is what this car does. At traffic lights I can see people looking at the car (police too). Whenever I park, usually there is someone complimenting the car or joking about getting tickets in it. They always say the same thing though........... ""Nice car."" And it is that.","Horsepower helps with the highway issues. Getting on the highway is not a problem at all. Because of the firm suspension, I enter highways at highway speeds. If I need to accelerate, still not a problem. Also, I purchased a Diablo Predator to adjust the settings on the ecu.

We all drive smallish imports; we're all giving those cars second thoughts now.

Had some problems, mostly with the dealer, Dependable Dodge, front end never stopped making noise. Finally took it to a local garage they fixed it. After that no real major problems. But still love foreign cars, drove the Maxima, did not like CVT, Acura TL, ugly front, nice inside, G8, did not like the seats, and a few more. But none could compare on price,power, and comfort of the Charger, plus life time warranty, and XM free 1 year. So far great, power is up so like that, and gas mileage is better than on the Magnum.

This car continues to win every time we drive it.  Even the Fuel economy (while not great in town) is impressive overall.  Averaged 25 MPG on a 1500 round trip to Colorado.  And what a comfortable ride for this caliber sports car.  It has a great balance between tight handling and comfort.  The uconnect, dash and console, emboidered leather heated seats, lighted cup holders, car information center (and on and on) are all outstanding feartures that have made driving for me and my family an experience again.

4.625,Charger SXT fun to drive,Steve Hubbell ,10/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"I dont have any real complaints except that the 3.5 liter HO V-6 loses power when the automatic 4 speed transmission shifts from 1st into second when the gear selector is in drive, accelerating from a stopped position. However you have to place the gear selector into 3rd to achieve the second gear power boost from a dead stop. The car is well designed and fun to drive. The 3.5 liter HO SOHC V-6 is plenty peppy and the chassis is very agile. My particular car is the 2009 SXT RWD 4SPD Auto. The fuel mileage is phenomenal when the gear selector is left in drive and you keep your foot out of the fuel injectors. The car is a joy to drive.",The interior is well thought out and executed. The ergonomics and comfort factors were thoroughly designed with the taller of the human's considered. I am six foot tall and dont fit in most cars. The leather interior coupled with the power bucket seats make for a very comfortable cabin. ,"I know that the second gear shift points are computer controlled for fule economy, but the shift points  for second need to be tweaked a little for the acceleration enthusiast."

4.875,"So far, a lot of fun",Aaron ,08/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought the 2009 R/T R package (Road and Track) - I think it is well worth the extra money - improved handling and the top line seats - only drawback they are (or at least at the time I bought) very hard to find. So far the car is great to drive - very comfortable on road trips - I can drive all day long. I also bought the upgraded sound system (Boston), best sounding factory installed system I have ever had. I live in Wisconsin, drove once in the snow earlier this year and I am planning on driving year round - from what I have experienced car should handle as good as any non 4X4 - just have to drive with common sense!

The Protection group adds Side air bag protections and self sealing Contioental touring tires. We added 18"" chrome wheels which really make the Bright Silver stand out.

Being in Michigan I was concerned about handling in the snow and on the dirt roads I live on, so the dealer let me test drive the Charger 20 miles home.

I use my 4X4 for big snowstorms, but I've put 1,200 on the RT thus far.
