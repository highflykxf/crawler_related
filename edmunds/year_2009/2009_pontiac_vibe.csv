It gets around like a boss in the winter with AWD & winter tires, I never worry about getting stuck. It fits much more than you would think, with the hard plastic fold down seats. The MPG for me is about 25 city 30 highway. I bought this car november '13 with 45,000 miles on it, today it has 230,000 miles. Only thing that broke by itself with the car was the transmission(mechanic put in a used one from a pontiac vibe with only 21k miles on it SCORE). Things I fixed because I broke it or it was a weird thing that was not the car makes fault: Evaporator(rock got in it and I lost defrost) 4 new wheels (flimsy steel core chrome plated rims bent when I curbed the car, couldn't unbend) everything else has been regular maintenance. I am having a problem with my coolant turning red(rust) right now but it's been a hot summer so I'd say my water pump or thermostat is on the fritz but even those are expected repairs with most any car eventually. Overall I don't have a single complaint with this car it has been so perfect and reliable for me",,

When the back seat are folded it creat a hugh loading space where we can feet 5-6  feet long objects from Ikea , a projector screen. So my car has become the utility car . Always love the high sitting position, with my bad back and hip ,it really helps a lot .Too bad they stopped making this model, they should have converted  this into a hybrid .

I like the extra features of moon roof, auto lights, great sound system, mp3 adapter and all the little areas to put things in :) don't let the outside make you think this small car is compact its anything but, its more roomy then my old ford tauras!
As I said great car for the price if your interested in a nice small hatchback look into these they are rare on the road and cheeper to get right now cause they are a pontiac :)","Turning radius isn't all to great, fine for the road but for turning around or getting out of tight spaces it takes a lot of shifting its about the same as my 02 ford taurus which is kinda sad really.

PAINT!!!!
One thing to watch out for when buying one of these cars is it seems they used cheep paint I have it in writing that mine will get detailed for free but there is A LOT of deep scratches and pot marks (like if a rock hits it) so be prepaired unlike I was to possibly get it painted if the dealer won't do it.

I was pleasantly surprised by this Vibe. The drivers seat raises, giving me some of the height I used to enjoy. This car is just fun to drive! Pick up is great, handles well. My 17 year old loves to drive it too. I have not had a chance to try out the AWD yet, but if my current satisfaction is any measure I know I will not be slowed by any snow!","Sunroof, gear shifter on console",A bit of a blind spot that you need to be careful of.

Great car and if you want to buy one, offer a ridiculously low amount to start with.  They are practically giving these away with all the incentives.  I wanted the 1.8L, but couldn't find one.  The 2.4 is more than enough power, but I still get over 30 MPG with 50/50 driving, so I'm very happy.  Manual is fun to drive and very comfortable.  Cargo space is great, as I can fit my bike in the back without taking any wheels off.  Sound system is great.  I switched from a huge suburban to this and I don't regret it.  Cash for clunkers program is a great deal.","Good gas mileage even with 2.4L engine with manual.  Comfy seats, tons of cargo room, and very fun to drive.  Can't beat the price right now.  With CARS program, I walked out with a fully loaded Vibe (minus automatic and sunroof) for under 12k includings taxes with cash for clunkers trade-in.","Wish you could turn off the lights at night manually (no option to do so).

The car is definitely worth its weight in gold, I traded in my 2003 Grand Am, and am very impressed that Pontiac has stuck with the great responsive, sport like steering.  The car overall has great body lines, interior is comfortable, and the fold down rear seats including the passenger are a great feature.  The overall pick-up response of the car is very impressive, especially in manual mode where you can get the few extra RPM's when wanting to get that ""race feel.""  Overall, you can feel the great quality everytime you get behind the wheel.  ","I enjoy the responsive Pontiac steering, great sleek styling, and the very throaty little 2.4 4 cyl. with the optional auto/manual shift transmission.

The ride is quiet and smooth, and the 2.4 engine provides more than enough power. The interior seems spacious and all the controls are in easy access. The interior uses alot of plastic, however it does not look or appear cheap. The seats are very comfortable in the front and rear, and the cargo space is incredible when the rear seats are folded down. The A/C blows nice and cold which is a plus, since I live in Florida. I wanted the upgraded radio, but mine has the base radio, however it sounds great. I've driven in some very heavy rain, and this car was terrific! GREAT CAR!!!","I like the rear cargo space and the comfortable seats. The steering is very responsive. This vehicle did well in the crash tests and has alot of safety features that are standard.

Very smooth and quiet, by comparison with good power. Fuel mileage has been outstanding.  With the rebates and credit card points available it was a deal we couldn't pass up, even though we weren't in the market for a new car. However, my wife has already informed me that she will be getting a speeding ticket as this Vibe is much quicker and smoother than her old one.  We're extremely pleased, again.

Nice, tight steering, it has more pickup than my 6 cyl Stratus, & the AWD plows through snow like a champ. Lots of cargo space  and super-versatile layout. I can fit almost anything that would have fit in my Blazer. CONS: I wish the Vibe offered more options. In this day and age, its crazy that you cant get power seats even if you want them!  Like others, I noticed the chippy paint, but thought it was due to living on a rocky dirt road. Also, everyone is raving about the milage- its ok, but I think a car of this size could do better.

5,I LOVE my Vibe,Hez ,06/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Vibe, by far, is the roomiest and best-riding car in its class and it is very fun to drive.  Having previously driven a Suburban, surprisingly, I do NOT feel like my bottom is dragging on the ground.  This car was purchased primarily for driving around town with kids in tow.  There is plenty of room in the back for them being in car seats.  My dog even enjoys riding in the ""trunk""! For those of you who think the Vibe is comparable to the Dodge Caliber, you're thinking WRONG!  I drove the Caliber and the Vibe in the same day and there is NO comparison.  The fuel economy is also great. I just filled up my tank in the Vibe and calculated 26 mpg city driving in 3rd gear! (see improvements)","XM radio, OnStar, OnStar phone feature, fold flat 60/40 rear seats and non- carpetted cargo area, LATCH, almost EVERYTHING!  CON:  the gear shifter is poorly designed (see improvements)","3rd gear and Drive are in the same spot: or so I thought.  It reads as 3-- D.  It's hard to describe, but this gear has a wider space so the shifter can be slid to the left or the right.  I finally figured out that left=3rd and right=Drive.  So 26 mpg with the rpms 3000-3500 isn't too shabby! "

I purchased the '09 last week at an incredible deal--$4300 off in GM/Driver's Edge card rebates, $3000 in additional rebates for paying cash, and at a price that was well below invoice!! I was a little concerned that Pontiac parts might not be available in the long haul but GM insures me that Vibe owners will be supported for years to come.

I take my dog with me most everywhere I go, so I decided on the Vibe based on its size and practicality.  I am very disappointed.  This is by far the noisiest vehicle I have every owned!  I find myself checking the windows to see if I left one of them open.  There seems to be no sound deadening insulation in this vehicle at all.  This makes long trips very tedious - and also makes listening to music impossible.  Also, the AWD model should be available with a manual transmission - the automatic doesn't allow you to coast freely - it's always holding you back causing you to play with the accelerator to hold a constant speed.",,

But, I always admired the Pontiac Vibe for its adorable design since the first time I ever saw it. These new defined designs of the car is just stunning! I've got the GT, and I love how this car looks! As an art major, it has been just spectacular having so much cargo space to haul my sculptures and oversized paintings. Very reliable car, not to mention it is crazy fun to drive. One thing I thought was great about the car was the magnificent interior design, but this is coming from someone who used to have cup holders directly under the radio, so I guess there's room for improvement on that note.","Gorgeous design, beats Matrix and Caliber.

4.875,Review by RMH,RHenningsen ,04/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"This the third Vibe we've owned and each one has had exceptional gas mileage. The last Vibe got 30.1 miles per gallon for 29000 miles.  This 2009 is averaging over 30 miles per gallon too. Repairs have only required service oil,filter,tire rotation and alignment on the 2006 model. The 2009 has only 3000 miles and has had no repairs as of yet.  On the 2009 model I miss the carpeting on the deck in back the shade covering that area along with the intermittent window washer. Other wise the 33.2 miles per gallon on a recent trip is great. I hate to see the Pontiac line disappear. Maybe they will give the vehicle to Chevrolet for a boost in their division car mileage requirements. ",High gas mileage.  Easy to drive.  The seats are comfortable for a car in that price range.  Fit and finish are great.  That proves two companies can produce a great vehicle.,Re install carpeting on the back deck put a good shade to cover the rear deck and put the intermittent wipers back on the vehicle.  The glove box could always be improved as well as the arm rest for the driver. Maybe they could do away with the Toyota gear shift. The notch shift is not to handy.

However, so far we are not too impressed with the build quality (center wheel caps fell off, sunroof leaks, rear view mirror vibrates, paint easily scratched; instrument panel rattles/squeaks in cold weather). Also, the gas mileage is only OK (averaging 24 mpg in mixed driving). Traction in the snow seems to be reasonably good.","XM radio, OnStar, rear cargo organizer","Improve build quality; offer 1.8 L engine (for better gas mileage) with full range of options available with 2.4 L engine, which seems to be more powerful than is really needed."

I cross-shopped it against a Honda Civic and a Mazda3 sedan. I found the Vibe to be more practical than the Mazda and nearly as fun to drive. It handles with confidence, and the 2.4L engine has ample power and a somewhat sporty sound. The appearance and build quality of the interior are nothing special, but the controls are well laid out and there are some useful features, such as the bag hook in the passenger footwell and the rear cargo organizer. Despite some quality control issues, I would recommend the Vibe to anyone looking for a small car that is highly practical, but also offers some driving enjoyment.","I like the smooth engine and sharp handling, and the styling is some of the best in this price range. The interior is thoughtfully-designed, the controls are simple and intuitive, (even the radio), and the seats are comfortable. The Monsoon stereo sounds great, and XM is standard.","The interior plastic scratches too easily, and the rear has some large blind spots. Quality control needs improvement - in the first few months the car was in the shop multiple times for dragging brakes, wheel caps that fell off, a leaky sunroof, and lettering on a sunroof switch that rubbed off."

Functionality of the car is great with lots of space (moved four winter tires and lots of gear while moving). I find the 1.8L to be plenty of power and gives upper level fuel economy (about 41 MPG Canadian average). Interior isn't anything special but seats are quality and thats all you really need. Perfect car for combining economy, function and a little bit of driving fun.","For safety reasons standard traction/stability control, and 6 airbags was a big plus over competition. Fuel economy and storage space makes it a much better option over an SUV. GM interest rates and incentives just made us laugh at Toyota salesmen pitches as well.",There is a slight blind spot with the larger pillers when shoulder checking.

We like the mileage we are getting but feel it could do better with a 5-speed trans. But Pontiac chose not to offer it on awd model. We bought chrome wheels which turned out to be just plastic wrapped chrome that chips and peels. Pontiac does not stand behind these. The awd model gets a roof rack that is worthless. There is no option for leather or heated seats so we had these installed after market. Radio options are limited and no navigation system option. Pontiac needs to get off their rear and go to work with these option pkgs. Or people will just look elsewhere. I called Pontiac with chrome wheel problem an,Installed after market leather seats and heaters and really like them. Makes the interior much plusher. Too bad Pontiac did not offer as option. They do offer some cheap half leather option on the gt model but not the awd.,Pontiac needs to work on their options and offer people the things they want in an auto. why is the 5-speed auto trans. not an option when at interstate speed of 70 mph or greater the rpm are over 3000. the 2.4 motor has plenty of torque for one more gear.even i know more than that.

4.875,2009 Vibe,john ,03/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"as much fun as my 2006 civic but more practical. I have a 2.4 with 5 spd auto which wasn't a choice on the drop down menu on this website.  Just got back from a 5000 km road trip and got about 39 mpg (Canadian) I rated the reliability high but really don't have the mileage to prove that, although the warranty is by Canadian standards very generous. ","comfortable seats, adjustable steering column, back hatch, performance, sunroof open, little interior wind or noise, auto head light system, no charge onstar safe program","none, great car for the money"

4.625,I still miss my 2005 Vibe!,Leslie Davies ,03/19/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"This is the 4th AWD drive Vibe I have owned.  I had to purchase it sight unseen since my '05 lease was ending.  I was delighted to hear that Pontiac was bring the AWD back, since it is such a fun, easy, efficient car to do errands around town.  I only have 200 miles on it so I suppose I need a little time to adjust. It is attractive outside and I love the bright red.  Inside, as a 5 foot tall women, I am still bothered by the lowering of the rear view mirror to accommodate the Onstar system, and the repositioning of the front right roof columns, along with the larger side mirrors.  These 3 things seem to change my sight lines-they are different than my others models. ",The outside temp displays and the handy fold down seats.,Raise the rear view mirror and reduce the size of side mirrors.

4.375,As fun as it looks....,badgerfan68 ,03/18/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"I've had my '09 Vibe for about a month and really enjoy it.  I have a GT w/ the 4sp automatic.  The vehicle is responsive with excellent acceleration and the steering is tight and active.  We've already taken a weekend road trip with the vehicle and comfortable carried my wife, child, dog and all the necessary gear associated with the aforementioned.  On the highway, we achieved 30 MPG, in town around 25 MPG.  The ride is very smooth and quiet, with minimal road noise. There are no squeaks and rattles so far (which drive me crazy) and the fit and finish is clean and tight.  Storage room is ample for compact car.","Quiet ride, no ""noises"".  Plenty of room and fund to drive.  Quick and responsive engine.  Above average gas mileage.",Still having a hard time finding a comfortable drivers seat position.  Upgrade to automatic XYZ axis seats for GT version.  Change bin attached to reading lamp lights to fit sunglasses better.  Current bin is virtually useless.  Cup holder in center console for backseat pass is weak and pop flies out

4.875,Love It!,vibe owner ,03/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,My husband and I just got our 2009 Vibe GT and this car is so fun to drive!  We have had the car for 6 days and I have put on 450 miles!  ,"My favorite features are the XM radio that displays the station, song and artist without having to do anything, the little triangle window behind the rear doors and just the overall sporty look they gave it.  It is very zippy for a 4 cylinder.....you barley touch the gas pedal and your off!  ",There are big blind spots in the back corners of the vehicle when backing out of a parking space. A little more room in the back seat so 3 people could comfortably sit. Offer heated seats as an option.
