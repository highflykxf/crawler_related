4,All Good Until Now,Roman M ,11/18/2016,4,4,5,,,4,4,4,5,,,"As long as you perform routine maintenance you should have a long lasting Altima. The items needing attention after 120,000 miles include ignition coils and now the most important and costly single item to date, the electronic steering lock. The extended dealer warrant for the ESCL ran out in 2015 for the 2009 model. Of course mine failed a year later. There is no recall for this well known issue concerning the lock so it will leave you stranded somewhere down the road, believe it. You can bang on the box for a temporary remedy, disable it with the knowledge that you are driving with a faulty item, or cough up $1000 to get it fixed at the dealer. All good choices. The honeymoon is over. I can live with the tire press low light (how easy is it to check your own pressures?), the CVT surge when accelerating, the routine maintenance, affordable brakes and parts easily replaced, but the one item I feel entrapped by Nissan's non committal to address and fix is what burns me.  Again, $1000 for a box you need to get going. Before you buy that used Altima consider this and ask if the ESCL was changed. Otherwise, it's a good comfortable car for commuting or day trips.",,

4,Almost like my beloved 92 Camry,Jim Wainscott ,11/11/2016,3,3,4,,,4,3,4,4,,,"Strengths:    It is mechanically reliable and when I took the plastic cover off the engine this year to get a better look at it I was surprised at how clean it was.    The rubber hoses are holding up well.    Good passing acceleration    Good overall craftsmanship and sturdiness in the engine compartment, interior, body    Paint is durable    Stiff suspension on good roads makes for excellent handling.    Nice small turning radius for a mid-sized car making it easier to park and maneuver in generalWeaknesses:    Suspension too stiff in dry weather when road conditions are bumpy, better in rainy weather. Overly sensitive to small changes in tire pressure due to a defective TPMS that had a slow leak for  three years since purchase until finally it was properly diagnosed when putting on new tires.    Accelerates too suddenly from zero unless you gingerly apply just a little pressure to the gas pedal. Takes some getting used to.    Brakes too grabby. You have to ease in on the brake pedal. Takes some getting used to.    Audio System has way too much base even at minimum setting of -5. Had to replace original unit one year from purchase because of no display. Audio quality on factory replacement unit is worse on mid-range and base.    Had to replace headlights after 4 years for fogging up (improper seal).    Though the headlights have good spread for detecting deer the depth of field is weak on distance.    Slant of windshield makes for compromised visibility for those wearing glasses because of optic interaction distortion between windshield and prescription glasses. Note - older cars with less slant to windshields have much better visibility.    Poor rear view vision out rear windows requires extensive use of side mirrors. Large truck and van drivers probably won't notice but the average car driver will.    MPG is less than advertised though that can be attributed to poor road conditions in Wake County NC and poorly timed traffic lights, and lately, drivers distracted by their cell phones.    Original tires made for poor handling. After they wore out I bought the Michelin Defender which improved drive-ability drastically, like night verses day.",,

They have poor customer service.  The regional manager I was speaking to hung up on me.  Poor quality, Buy a Toyota itâ€™s a better car.  Look into the class actions law suite regarding melting dash board and the concerns around safety.  Nissan refused to replace mine because it is out of warranty. They are currently involved in a Class Action suit that goes to trial this summer. This is not an isolated problem.  There are many reports of the 2008 and 2009 years with this issue.  It is truly a safety problem.  The dash gets so shiny that when driving into the sun you cannot see.  Nissan as well as the other Japanese auto makers are fully aware of the substandard dashboards.  Toyota stepped up and extended the warranty on both the Toyota and Lexus brands. Nissan refuses to do anything unless they lose the class action suit and even then I fully expect them to drag their feet.  The dealer I took my car to for the inspection wished me luck but basically said Nissan Corporate will do nothing to help you.

1,Don't buy!,Brian Hertling ,02/04/2016,1,2,3,,,1,1,3,2,,,"Well here it goes...I don't complain much, but Ive had it with my 2009 Nissan Altima. The steering lock column has failed on me, leaving the vehicle dead in its tracks.  After researching the issue, Ive learned that it has been and continues to be a major issue on this make and model. I reside in Minnesota and this happened at night with the temperature of -5 and wind-chills at -30 leaving my wife and I stranded 30 miles from home and 45 miles from the nearest Nissan dealer. The $700 part fails to disengage from the steering column and therefore renders the car useless. After numerous conversations with Nissan consumer affairs I have yet to get an answer. Apparently they extended the warranty for this part, but go figure...It happened to me after the warranty expired.  In doing more research I have learned that unless a certified Nissan mechanic diagnosis the issue they(consumer affairs) cant or wont(not sure) do anything for me. Furthermore, the part is the size of a deck cards and riveted so I cant replace the part myself. So, long story short...$700 part, $300 in labor, $150 towing bill for a part that is essentially useless. What has me upset is that Nissan knowingly has not placed a recall on the part even though there have been thousands of issues directly related to this issue....Not to mention its on the National Highway Safety Dept list of hazards.

Why are these companies being allowed to sell a vehicle if they are aware that they have transmission problems.

Combine that with an EXTREMELY outdated exterior/interior, unbearable rear seats, a mediocre sound system, and a lack of joy, and you are left with what is quite possibly the worst midsized car sold today.

My question to those who don't like the power or CVT:  did you even bother to test drive before purchase?  This (at least the coupe) has been a get-what-you-see experience.

They also told me the battery was low which was ridiculous after such a short time. Agrees with what others have said about battery drain. They replaced the switch and the battery.

4.5,ALTIMA 3.5 SE SEDAN,Brandon ,11/22/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,3,5,Car is a blast to drive.  The 3.5 mated to the CVT tranny is fantastic.  The combination gives immediate throttle response and will push you back in the drivers seat.  The handling is great also.  Very sure- footed around corners and on the freeway.  Steering is tight and responsive.   Quality touch and feel to the interior.  Well built and stylish.  Alternator had a problem (important to note that the car still started and drove fine) and was grounding out on the frame somehow only six weeks after purchase (This is my fourth Nissan and all have been very reliable).  Dealer fixed without question and back on the road enjoying car the next day.  Drives and feels like a $45K car,The VQ V6 engine.  Has great response and power yet it is well controlled with the CVT. ,None really other than maybe a lower gear ratio of the CVT to get better mileage.  Getting about 21 MPG in mixed highway/city driving doing about 20 miles roundtrip daily with moderate acceleration.
5,Fantastic Travel Car,Don Douglas ,11/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We wanted a vehicle which offered comfort first and economy second for our retirement travels. Our 2009 Altima has exceeded expectations. It is as comfortable on the open road as our 2003 Tahoe and gets 32 mpg at and 5 mph above speed limits with AC on. Also pleasantly surprised with 29 mph around town. Has sufficient power to climb I70 from Denver into the Rockies with ease. Bought the Altima after extensive comparisons to the Camry, Accord and Hyundai Sonata. Altima won for riding comfort and power in the 4- cylinder group. Cannot be more pleased with our selection and would recommend this car to anyone.    ","Style, riding comfort, economy.

Good Stereo sound and quality. Nice acceleration, smooth steering handling. ","Side mirrors should fold in, also directional signals should be built in on side mirrors, and they should be heated.

The Altima is a really nice car that is hampered by bad engineering and shoddy workmanship.

3,Hesitation on Acceleration,Gary Nadeau ,10/14/2009,,,5,5,1,3,,1,4,4,1,"When accelerating the car hesitates significantly.  This happens primarily in going from slower to faster speeds and around 2000rpm.  Then when you give it a touch more gas, it takes off.  It borders on being dangerous.

The main selling point to go with the Altima was the look of the car.  I have received many compliments on the car that I do not believe I would receive had I bought either of the other two cars.  Aside from the looks, this car has been fantastic.  The fuel economy has been amazing, do not believe any review that tells you otherwise.

Great handling, good acceleration and power, even in the I4!  Got our 3.5  after testing 4 and the 2.5 after testing 6 (each time visiting 3 dealers).   Learned something very valuable -- out-of-round tires cause bad vibrations/shimmy!  (Result of sitting in one spot on the lot too long -- a year or so. Permanently damages the steel belt radials -- you need new tires.)   Also, discovered that cars made in Canton (rather than Smyrna) seem to be better -- quieter engines and superior quality parts such as knobs/trim.  Must be the QA program Canton established after a bad start.","Love the cornering -- ""on rails"" -- and the CVT that gives you power without sounding like a lawn mower.  Seats are comfy and trip computer on the dash display alternating with temperature, mpg, etc is convenient. Home link / dimming mirror with compass is an essential tool you'll want and enjoy.","Those are some ugly wipers -- big, thick rods that do a marvelous job but look like Obie Wan's saber going across in front of you.

The only thing worng is that the right wiper doesnt work right. So I am going to take it to get the wiper replaced. But as far as a v6 it is an awesome car. Better than Toyota and Honda.

I think the headlights need a bit more work though (needs to be more like the 370z). I wish there were LED tail lights as well. It would also be nice if there was a remote trunk release.

First the good - great power for a 4-cyl and great gas mileage.  Interior is plain but functional.  Very stylish.   But now the bad.  After 1 week of driving - A LOT of vibrations in the floor and pedals from the road.  It is to the point now that my feet physically hurt if I operate the car for more than 20 minutes. According to 2 different Nissan mechanics, this is ""perfectly normal"" and ""why the car is so cheap."" I don't consider $24K to be cheap and I certainly don't expect any car to operate like this one.  This purchase is a regrettable one for sure.","Gas mileage, excellent power of the 4-cyl. engine, styling","Better insulation to lots of vibrations and road/tire noise.  There is just WAY too much of it and it truly affects the operation of the vehicle.  This fact alone makes it, in my mind, far inferior to others in its class like the Fusion, Camry, and Accord.  It amazes me how this car gets high marks."
4.75,A winner,elvtars ,07/18/09 19:23 PM (PDT),5,5,4,5,5,4,5,5," I'm what you could consider a hesitant buyer, someone who may spend a year researching and test driving vehicles before committing to buy. As a long- time Honda owner (I still own an Odyssey), the Accord was my initial favorite, but I've researched and test drove most of the competition as well. These are all excellent cars. While I cannot claim that the Altima is the better car, it had enough features I liked to win me over. I owned it for almost 3 months now and I am still excited every morning when I get into it. Since the Accord was my initial choice, I'm listing below the features of the Altima that won me over. What I liked in the competition is listed as suggested improvements.","Sporty handling, very smooth CVT, powerful 270 HP V6 engine, quiet interior, stylish yet friendly interior design, simple, easy to use central column controls, premium Bose stereo, included Bluetooth connectivity, smart key system, auto headlights, trip computer, comfortable seats, rear vents","Use regular fuel instead of premium, improve fuel mileage. Ride can be on the harsh side sometimes. Add power passenger seat, memory seats and mirrors, auto-dimming side mirrors. XM satellite radio should allow station presets and should operate from the steering wheel. Better exterior styling ."

Stereo is ok, nothing special. Great value for the money.",Push to start ignition. The way the key fob works. Fuel economy. Styling. Comfort. Value. ,"Don't like the suitcase-crushers in the trunk.

After about 30 days of ownership, car is exceeding our expectations. Price paid is also a big plus since we were able to negotiate a total of almost $5k off the sticker price of $28.2k. ","Distinctive styling of the coupe, it looks very different than the sedan and there are far fewer of them on the road. Front seats are extremely comfortable and overall fit and finish is outstanding for a car in this price range. Plenty of room in the back seat for 3 kids.",Memory settings for driver seat also have seat return to original position after accessing rear seats. Upgraded stereo is just OK. 
5,Awesome!,Tomasso ,07/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Altima's suspension is superior to the 3-series.  It handle Manhattan and Jersey pot holes as if they don't exist.  The steering is tight and responsive.  Got a sick deal too. Fully-loaded (without nav) for $1,500 below invoice and got them to throw in fog lights.  ","Bose system is fierce, convenience package, climate control.","In the city, you absolutely need folding mirrors.  It's a great disappointment that I was unable to have them on the 2.5SL.  Also, heated mirrors are essential for the winter. Also, the leather should have been fully covered under each headrest -- it looks cheap when they're raised and u see cloth."

Compared with others in its class, Nissan is noisy. Its engines (both 2.5 and 3.5L) produce, on average, 10-15HP more than the competition but at what cost!!! Engine noise beyond 2000RPM is excessive! At par with Suzuki I've driven the other day (yes, it's that bad)!!!  On the positive side, the exterior and interior design is fantastic. No nonsense or extra not needed buttons. Everything is ergonomically laid out and easy to use.  CVT is the biggest and unique feature about this car though (surprisingly) it's not as smooth as it seems. You just touch the gas slightly and it jolts.","Interior design, ergonomical button layout.",Engine noise is intrusive in the cabin beyond 2000RPM.

I always buy Nissan, as they are $2 to 5k cheaper than Toyota and the fit, finish and quality are comparable.  I love this car and it is fun to drive.  Love the Keyless entry and push button starter. Trunk is very nice.  All around, I think this car, in Dark slate and charcoal interior looks very classy, and can compete with next model up lines. ","The interior and exterior are beautiful.  I look at those that bought entry-level BMW's for $35k and think this car is every bit as good, for $17k.  Like the Aux input for the MP3 players.  Good sounding audio system.

I compared to Honda Accord but it was kind of boring...I just kept thinkin about the Altima and I'm so happy I went with my gut feeling and chose this over the Honda.  I have a child so needed a sedan for practical reasons, but I still wanted something a lil sporty too and this is it..the two pipes out the back add to the fun look and I got the rear spoiler which is nice.

I put lots of highway miles on my cars, and often drive deep into Mexico, e.g., Acapulco, so comfort, fuel economy, and RELIABILITY are top concerns of mine.

Passengers have commented on how well it rides and how it looks.  It is a quiet car even at highway speed.  Another reviewer complained about the sound of the turn signal; I think it's so quiet I have to visually check to see that it's actually on.  Keyless entry/push button start takes some adjustment, but is very convenient.  Good A/C and stereo with the convenience package.  Absolutely no doubts or regrets to this point.","Love the back end design, love the interior.  Much sportier to drive than the Camry in my opinion, and it seems to be a nicer interior.  CVT takes a little getting used to, but is ultimately smoother than a traditional transmission, especially when needing power at highway speed.","The rear view mirrors could be bigger; not unsafe by any means, but it would be nice to see more.

I don't know if this is my doing or not, but my breaks are already squeaking (?!)  Breaking is not as tight as I would like but steering and maneuvering is fun, esp. for its size.  Engine is loud but it's not a bad thing in my opinion.  It's pretty easy to parallel park.  Center console is nicely set up (and BOSE rocksss) but knobs do seem a little cheap.  Back seat is smaller than other cars in its class.  Trunk is huge.

Initially worried about getting a four cylinder to commute across a small mountain everyday on the way to work. Those fears have been put to rest and the cvt helps slow the car when going downhill. Very smooth ride and currently averaging 27 mpg. ,"keyless entry, CVT, Bose Stereo, heated seats",Allow people to get foglights without having to plunk down $2000 for a navigation system.  auto lock for doors after you walk away.
5,Nice Car,dan p. ,03/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Ive been very impressed so far with this car. The price was great for such a reliable car. It is not only reliable but can be quick and great on gas. ,"many features are included in the ""basic"" model",
4.375,Good car,ben0123 ,03/12/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,5,5,This is my first new car and I really like it. I was testing 2008 altima coupe 2.5s and Honda accord coupe exl. Even though I like the long term reliability of Honda but I like the style and performance of altima coupe. It is much quite than the Honda accord. I would recommend this car to anyone who likes the sport car. Accord coupe is also a beautiful car but I think it is still like a family car. ,star/ stop button. ,"17"" wheels on 2.5 model.

5,Great Car Great Price,PFC Mendoza ,03/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I'm in the army so I travel alot and the Nissan altima is the perfect car for me. It's great on gas and it has plenty of room for me and my family. Its a smooth ride and its very quiet for being a 4 cylinder.

4.75,Great Car,ddemlong ,02/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I was out looking for a new family car after selling my sports car from my little girl being born. I looked at several other brands but also at the Sentra. I found the Altima to be big enough on the inside for the large rear facing car seat we had trouble fitting in other vehicles. The steering response on the vehicle is great, I get an average of combined 26 mpg. The car feels peppy for the 4cyl and the CVT is very smooth. Interior materials seem of good quality and buttons and knobs are conveniently placed. Standard all disc brakes and ABS is a nice feature and the safety features cant be beat. Great 5 star safety ratings. Its the highest in its class. I also really like the exterior looks.","CVT, Intelli Key, ABS, disc brakes, interior space, trunk space, exterior design","Standard High Intensity Discharge Lights (or at least available for 4cyl models), Stability Control"
5,So Far So Great...,Nando9 ,02/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this car two days ago. I am a believer in waiting to give a review until a full month or two has passed, as you can't understand a car fully in a couple of days.  I will update my review to include whatever needs to be updated at that time. So far I love the car. It looks great both interior and exterior and more importantly, it runs GREAT! The CVT is weird at first but is actually pretty neat. It is one factor that gives this car great mpg. The push to start is another neat perk. The car rides smooth, runs very quiet, and has a good load of features fro the price. The dealer tried the usual tricks to rip me off, but I was able to hold off and get what I feel is a v good deal","CVT, push to start, keyless entry, auxiliary input.",The transmitter key technology makes it difficult to have a remote starter on the vehicle.

CVT is neat but keep waiting for the final shift into 5th. Very cool!!! Looked at equally optioned Camry and Accord. We were set to purchase Accord until driving the Altima. Only had for 2 days now.

The one thing that I found very odd: there is no radio in the base version? Dealer had to install one for me. Car looks good (minus the wheel covers... I don't get that either). Engine noise is present, but it's a 4 cyl so its expected. Push button start is cool. Display is cool. Overall it's a nice ride for the money.",CVT in manual mode is fun! Push button start. Dual exhaust on all models. Looks sharp. Pretty quick. Good MPG rating. Dash is well laid out. Good ride.,"A radio standard on all models... I mean, really? It's 2009, put a radio in it.  Why wheel covers?  Engine noise can be annoying, but then again I wouldn't be able to hear it if I had a radio.  Blind spots are large.  "
5,Very Pleased with the Altima,ghowe3 ,01/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just leased a fully loaded Altima (except for navigation) after leasing a 530i.  Not as bad as a drop off in car as I thought.  The Altima is sporty, quick on the highway and gets excellent gas mileage.  The interior is roomy and sporty with a big advantage over the BMW - there is much more storage space and cup holders.

Twice today the passenger airbag light turned off with the passenger seated with seatbelt on. Whatever car you're getting, check out the NHTSA website for safety complaints.   Its a bumpy ride, I guess the price you pay for more performance.  The CVT is good, as is the low end torque. Attention to detail and quality are a couple of levels below Camry & Honda.

5,Liking My Altima,Farkles ,12/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am leasing an '09 after my '94 Camry finally broke down.  I looked at Camry, the Aura and a slightly used Milan, but the Altima was more fun to drive, with lots of interior space and a more eye catching exterior.  My Altima has been problem free and enjoyable from day one.  It handles well, has easy controls, and gives some refinement along with fun. ","I thought the push button start was just a nifty perk, but it has turned out to be something I really enjoy.  The car has proven to be very comfortable on long drives, and I appreciate its handling.  I love the exterior looks.  CVT has been very cool.  Back seat passengers have been happy.","The windshield wipers have an annoying click.  The side view mirrors have some design issues - they are set in a fairly deep surround, and that contributes to water spotting.  The windshield is very sloped and it is hard to tell where the front end of the car is when you are driving or parking.  "
4,09 Altima 2.5 with Navigation,Dan ,12/20/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,You get your money's worth! The 2.5 with navigation has many high end features of luxury brands without the price. I traded in an 07 Audi A4 which had more torque and better cornering but the Altima has a lot more to offer for the price and looks just as sporty. The navigation system with integrated Bluetooth and Bose stereo is great. The fog lights and rear spoiler make the car more sporty. The CVT is great but the engine can be loud when you accelerate quickly. Push button start is a cool and convenient feature. I'm happy with my purchase and got a fantastic lease payment! ,"Navigation with integrated Bluetooth and Bose stereo, push button start, rear spoiler, fog lights, one-touch sunroof, 20 gallon gas tank and strong fuel economy using regular gas","Less engine noise, more torque, better cornering and sportier handling, iPod plug should be in middle console and songs should display on navigation screen."
4.625,I Love It,Brad ,12/19/2008,,,5,4,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"After test driving a 2.5 SL and a 3.5 SL, I had to get the 3.5 SL.  To me, the small difference in price and sacrifice in gas mileage/premium gas were worth it.  The engine has a lot of power (100hp more), sounds great, the car has a more solid feel, and is just tons more fun to drive!  The black leather interior is very stylish and comfortable.  So far nothing is rattling.  The CVT and overall ride are very smooth.  There are some quirks to the car, like if I press the Bluetooth buttons on the steering wheel hard, the horn beeps, and it feels like it is engine braking more than it should when I take my foot off the gas, but they don't bother me too much (yet).","270hp V6, Bluetooth, CVT, Keyless entry/push start, heated seats, auto headlights.","Exterior styling (front end, center brake light), manufacture more V6s (I had to get mine from over 300 miles away), power passenger seat."

We found the Nissan Altima had the highest safety rating so we bought it.  Now I can tell that not only you feel safe driving it, but also fun driving it.  It feels so smooth and, the fuel economy is just excellent.  We are so glad that we bought it rather than Toyota Camry which we looked at first.  Camry is a good car too.  But Altima 2.5 S is just great.  ",,

As I drove off the lot, it was drizzing - the windshield wipers have a loud annoying - clack ... clack .. clack ..  The blinker is a cheap - click click, click click.  The storage under the radio won't shut, its stuck open and the cheap plastic shifter cover pops off. I'm having buyers remorse after 5 minutes off the lot!  - my 2002 Camry can do 5000 or 7500 miles between old changes, the Altima is ~3500 miles.  The CVT is what sold me.

I initially went to purchase the 2009 Nissan Rogue, but quickly changed my mind after test driving the Altima. The price compared to the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord is good.
