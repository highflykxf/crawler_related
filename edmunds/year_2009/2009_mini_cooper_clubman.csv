It was a great ride since I had owned a MG Midget years earlier, so I knew how these little cars feel.  But, in 2015 all the problems started with engine light coming on over and over again with these dates and findings, 1) June 2015 - Jan. 2016 a chasing oil leak four times ($ 300 a pop), 2)  April 2015 timing chain failure (covered by Mini),  Feb. 2016 crack in oil line ( ($750), March 2016 (twice in the shop) another oil leak ($675 each time).  April 2016 when I checked the oil and found there was none in the reservoir. The idiot that had worked on my car at the dealer had forgotten to place oil back in after the second March 2016 repair (the service manager said he had been fired due to other complaints) I found this out when I left he vehicle for four (4) days stay at the dealer (I always had it serviced at the Dealer to keep the records accessible) andApril 2016 I was told another oil leak and vacuum hose issue ($1,100). May 2016 -A week later, the engine light was back on, this time carbon build-up ($2,700). I spent  total of $7,100 on this vehicle from June 2015 to May 2016. Needless to say, I sold (not traded it in) it in a private sale to a guy that collects cars and wanted a 2009 Mini. He did not care about the issues, he just wanted the car and paid the price I asked. It was shipped from Charleston, SC to San Diego, CA on his dime. I purchased a 2016 Outback. Why? I just could not bring myself to trust the Mini mechanics after the oil misstep.",,

The sales process was easy but the car was not thoroughly reviewed regarding the complicated alert system for maintanence. The dealership uses the car system to tell the owner that maintance is needed. There is no 5000 mile oil change schedule. The problem is that a yellow light comes on for one second at start and the owner has to go through a complicated push button hold 2 seconds, scroll to another screen, hold again ....... The engines probably love this feature but it is complicated. A big yellow light tells you that the temperature is 32 but you never get a similar warning for important things such as oil level low.",Fun to drive. Peppy and sporty. Great gas mileage.,"Warranty replacement issues are tight. Few certified mechanics so you may have to wait for your car to be serviced. Unusual warranty agreement between the dealership and mini usa. Delearship audited regularly and if the car has been service under warranty and the auditors diagree, the car delearship has to eat everything and the auditors begin to search more for warranty work to deny. This trickles down to you the customer. Every trick in the book will be used to refuse to cover parts under warranty. Air bag sensor bad in warranty..... water spilled on sensor.

We had to diagnose the problem via the MINI discussion boards on the internet, and traced it to a poorly installed gasket in the A/C system.   Other problems included rear-door seals that didn't seal, an inaccurate speedometer, and shut-downs due to bad throttle assemblies.

The automatic tire pressure sensor gives false alarms, so the local dealer wants me to pay to fill the tires with nitrogen.  Don't put barefoot kids or anything delicate in the backseat floor because the runners that slide the seats are incredibly sharp, exposed metal. They punctured a 2L soda bottle recently. It got under the carpet, and the dealer wanted $900 to dry it out, claiming no fault because cargo belongs in the cargo area (duh? but sharp metal is ok for people?) My auto body guy did it for $300.

The service at the dealership is awesome and their customer service is one reason why I purchased another mini.  I gotta admit, I do like the clubman better than the mini...feels more stable.

5,I never thought I'd drive a MINI,SCBlueDevil ,01/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After driving an Infiniti FX-45 for 4 years, when gas hit $4 I got tired of 13 MPG. I wanted something sporty, unique, and borderline practical. A regular Mini was too small, but the Clubman was love at first sight. I'm 6'4"" and it's as comfortable as most full sized cars. It is a blast to drive, a definite show stopper in parking lots, and is averaging 26/35 MPG. I  just wish someone had warned me that Minis are like Harleys - the initial purchase is just the start, then you become obsessed with everything Mini!  Oh well, everybody needs a few vices in life.","Looks, handling, paddle shifters, amazing heated seats, the stares and smiles you get while driving it",Not a thing!

What's not to love!","Looks, handling, gas mileage",More practical arm rest and the sport seats are a little tight for my rear end.

4.875,A total winner,GLEN & PRISCILLA ,12/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is absolutely beautiful. We owned a 2004 Mini and never had any problems. We purchased the 2009 Clubman base model and personalized it. The upgraded stereo is worth the money,  the heated seats are an absolute joy. The car has a ""Sport Mode"" that is a lot of fun to use. It's nice to have the extra room in the back and the barn doors are just great.  We can actually bring our adult children with us now in the rear seat.  Mileage is about 28 M.P.G.",Barn doors & extra rear door,None

4.75,Worth the Wait,Alan C ,10/31/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"My wife and I had been shopping for a small economical car with some pizzazz for a couple of weeks. We had ruled out the Mini Cooper because of the backseat and lack of traditional storage. We had been looking at Japanese cars, none of which fit her requirements, when we heard of the new MINI Clubman.  She did an Edmund's comparison online and was intrigued, so we headed out to the dealer where she fell in love with the S model.  We diligently  made our choices online and ordered her baby. Just picked it up after 2 1/2 months waiting, it was worth it to her. She hasn't stop smiling.","Fun factor, driving characteristics are tops. Bluetooth, stereo, convenience package and other electronics exceeded my wive's expectations. Xenon headlights work wonderfully. Seats very supportive.",Paint on sport stripes instead of using decals. Electrically adjustable front seats would be nice. Come up with a more useful center armrest.

4.75,Great Little Car,Chris M ,10/14/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,Always wanted a Mini but felt the back seat was unusable.  Clubman is the perfect solution. Just as economical and fun to drive but with room for four. Have to fight my wife for who gets to drive it.  ,Handling is excellent and fuel economy is great too.  Hard to find both in one vehicle. Start/stop button is a cool gimmick. Barn doors make loading easier. Mood lighting also a cool feature.,A/C controls are somewhat awkward. Needs more storage space for CDs. Lost one piece of trim - easily replaced.
