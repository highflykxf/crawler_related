I have 60k miles so far and not once had a problem with the car other then changing the battery due to the heat in Phoenix. The design and style is attractive and the interior despite it's bad reviews I love. The gas millage is great with mine getting 29mpg on average. The only complaint I have is the 4spd transmission is really slow at picking up when you need the power but other then that this car is awesome.,The overall design of the car,The slow power of the engine needs major work... A Geo Metro has more pick up power then this car.

Christmas Eve, and an old man with hearing aids nearly caused a head-on collision with me by veering into on-coming traffic in an ill-timed attempt to make a left.Between my seatbelt and the airbag, I barely felt the collision (I managed to swerve enough to clonk into his rear quarterpanel as he turned) and am not sore at all today. Plus, this car is built like a tank because, despite the harsh hit, only the front end was damaged.

Its driver power adjusted seat and heated front leather seats are very comfortable.  the only negative thing that i can think of is that the 6 cylinder engine gets about 25 miles to the gallon and i would like to see it get a little better than that to save money and off set the cost of the car.

I thought that the R/T offered quite a few options for very little money.  While the 4 cy. engine won't beat anyone off the line, I do get about 24 mpg. The ride is very smooth and the car is fun to drive.  There is a blind spot to get used to and the chrome around the gear shift can cause a glare, but otherwise I like the chrome look.
