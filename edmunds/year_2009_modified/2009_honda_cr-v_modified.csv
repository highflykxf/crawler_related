4,Runs Great - Poor Interior Design,Fitzee ,11/01/2016,5,3,2,,,5,4,5,2,,,"I get that this car was designed before social media. While I love the car itself (holds its value, runs great, good in the snow) the interior design SUCKS.  There is NO place to put your phone. Unless you want it in the giant covered pocket in the console where, because it has no ""not an ashtray"" (like my Pilot did), I have to keep my spare change. The USB port is buried way down the bottom of the dashboard, not easy to get it & you need a long cord running to your phone to keep it charged. The AUX port is buried in the ""box"" between the seats. Since I play my ipod alot (& this car has no built in Bluetooth) I have a cord coming out of there for my music as well. People always ask me how I like my car. I always say ""nice car, sucky interior design"". I'm now looking at a newer CRV, the design inside seems better. Course in my opinion, it couldn't be much worse than this one.",,

3,Would not buy another Honda,John Bright ,07/04/2016,3,3,3,,,2,5,4,3,,,I have had 2 issues with my vehicle that was not resolved to my satisfication after contacting the Corporate Office. I believe they are known issues and Honda does not care. My next purchase wil be a different Manufacturer.,,
4,"Reliable, comfortable - might buy another one",M Hurst ,03/01/2016,4,3,5,,,4,3,3,3,,,"I've owned many Hondas, this is my first CR-V.   It had been a leased vehicle, so when I purchased it, in 2011, it had 16,000 miles on it.  As of today (9/8/2016) - it has 98,000 miles on the odometer and it runs as smoothly.  I've had it serviced regularly at a Honda dealer, so any parts which have been replaced (very few) are Honda parts.Honestly, I don't know if I'd purchase another one.    I've recently been checking out newer SUVs in the same size, and although I've discovered the CR-V still has the largest cargo area (taller than most) - Honda could improve the backseat/cargo area by allowing the backseats to fold completely flat.   There are several other SUVs which have this.     I do love my fully adjustable driver's seat, but I think it is only available on the EX-L version.  CONS   These include:  some road noise, back seats which don't  fold completely flat, and it should get better gas mileage for a 4-cylinder engine.   My vehicle needed both airbags replaced due to the recall.   My local dealer kept giving me the run around.    I finally called Honda direct and discovered that because both of mine needed replacing, I was entitled to a loaner until mine were replaced.    Low and behold, the dealer came through with a brand new 2016 for me to drive and replaced mine within a week.    As for the brand new CRV.....it was comfortable, but the road noise still existed.   Not as bad as my 2009 model, but it was still there.   The dashboard controls were difficult to learn, but the backup camera was nice.    It irritated me that Honda has removed a CD player from the dash.   Perhaps one can be ordered...but I like to listen to Audio Books on long drives, and this would prevent that.   I'll be looking at another brand of SUV when I replace mine.",,

5,Nice Small Honda CR-V EX-L AWD (love it so far),Ray ,02/05/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,"Recently picked up an 09 Honda CR-V EX-L AWD with 88,800 miles on it (This is my first Honda). Go to say, overall I am fairly impressed by it. I did a thorough overall inspection in, out, around, under, etc... and that was before I got in it to test how it drives, shifts, sounds, etc...) For having that many miles on it I have to say it looks and drives like an auto that would have half the miles on it. I can't comment on reliability and costs yet as I just picked it up a week ago. So far though, it runs, drives and looks great. I got an excellent deal at $11K purchase price. Everything in and out functions as it should and I received it with new brakes all around and new tires. I have owned a few Chevy SUV's in the past and seriously those were ready for the junk yard by the time they hit 100k miles, not to mention that they were both money pits (I do maintain my autos faithfully and do most of the maintenance work myself so I know the job is getting done correctly). I do not beat on my autos, it can be hard to determine how a machine will hold up as everyone drives and maintains there autos differently. I will try and do my best to update my review as time goes by (this one will be tested in the New England environment).We like my Honda CR-V so much that we are in the process of trading in my wife's Kia Soul (purchased new, now has 78,000 miles on it) for another Honda CRV",,
4,Great SUV for a single man,calicorkication ,12/15/2015,4,4,4,,,4,4,5,4,,,"This car has been great for my needs.  Mainly, I use it for car camping.  I removed the back seat and use the extra room for moving furniture and large items.  When I bought the car, it had a tow hitch already installed.  I have used it to pull several U-haul trailers and a flatbed trailer borrowed from a friend to move sofas, love seats, etc and it has worked great for all purposes.  Also, I added a roof rack and a cargo box that has worked great for my needs.  The original tires that were on it when I bought it used lasted for 85,000 miles.I tend to get 24 mpg with a mix of city and highway use.  If I travel at 70 mph on the interstates and/or take back road highways at 55 mph, I tend to get the 27 mpg that Honda states the car can get.  Otherwise, if I drive 75 mph I tend to get 24-25 mpg.My main complaints are the drivers side power window is not always reliable but the others work fine up to this point.  Also, the moon roof has not opened in nearly 3 years.  I have tried to reset it following online instructions and I can hear a sound like a motor trying to move it but it goes nowhere so I stop to avoid breaking it further.",,
4,Honda continues to make great vehicles,M. Hurst ,12/14/2015,4,4,5,,,4,4,5,4,,,"I purchased my '09 CRV in January 2011.  It had been a leased car and only had 16,000 miles on it.   The other vehicles I was considering at that time were a 2011 Hyunda Tucson, a 2011 Toyota RAV4, a Toyota Venza, and a Chevy Traverse.   I've enjoyed driving this car.  It's very comfortable on long trips (it's been cross-country 4X), has plenty of power, and the cargo area is much larger in cubic feet than most other small SUVs.    I have dogs, which I take to weekend events, and the rear easily holds 2 crates, although I am concerned if I were rear-ended whether they would be safe.I have had it routinely serviced at a Honda dealer, replace the battery once, and all four tires.  A few months ago the TPMS light went on, and sure enough I had a damaged tire which had to be replaced.   The downside...it kept coming on at least once a week, which would cause me to panic and immediately look for a service center.    After a few weeks of this, I took it to my Honda dealer.  They told me all 4 tire sensors were shot and needed to be replaced.   Total parts & labor:  $500Only complaints (which Honda has not improved/changed) are:  road noise, should get better mileage for a small 4 cylinder engine, no vents to deliver air to back seat or rear compartment, and the backseat does not fold completely flat.   I had planned on trading it in on a new SUV this past winter, only to be told by several dealers that they would only give me wholesale price for it.   The reason?    It is one of the millions of vehicles which has a defective airbag.  Honda sent me the recall notice several months ago, and I immediately called to be put on the list.   As of today, they tell me they are getting very few air bags in and it may be a very long wait.   I'd like to get a newer vehicle, but not willing to take approx. $5k for my car.Would I purchase another Honda CRV - yes!",,

4.5,Checking in at 20K,chuckfromli ,04/02/2012,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"Just passed 20K recently. Went on KBB a few minutes ago to see what the car is worth. Private party value for very good condition is 21K. That means I only lost about $5500 in almost three years and 20,000 miles, and I didn't even enter my mileage. Their default was like 40K miles!Car is overall very, very good. Love the heated seats and the sound system. I have not had any problems at all.

Get 24 mph running around and have gotten as high as 30-31 mph long trip; babying it! I seem to use a quart of oil Mobil synthetic every 2000 mi or so! The dealer says anything over a quart every 1000 mi is within normal limits. The Tires that came on the vehicle are ""crap"". I changed them at 28,000 mi and they were nearly bald. Could have been changed several thousand miles earlier. I generally keep the vehicles for 200,000 miles. I change the oil at 15% averaging every 10,000 miles or so!

4.375,"At 15,000+ miles",chuckfromli ,09/03/2011,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"Just had it in to Honda for a recall regarding a transmission upgrade. Also had my third oil change and tire rotation at this time. No problems with the vehicle at all. Gas mileage varies a lot though. It can get 26-27 MPG on highway if the road is level. That will drop to 22-24 if there are hills. Around the crowded suburbs I average about 21 MPG. The leather seats are cheap, no doubt. It seems only the drivers seat is actually leather.And there is a lot of wind noise if you open just one of the front windows on the highway. You need to crack open one of the rear windows too. But this is true in many cars and vans these days it seems.","Still keep the XM radio-can't live without it now. The heated seats works great. The seats are comfortable to me, and I've never had a problem with the headrest position.
It is just a good, reliable, maneuverable car/SUV.
The resale value is phenomenal too. I see Honda dealers asking MSRP for year old vehicles, and even two year old ones they are asking for only about $2000 under original MSRP. I know those are asking prices, but still, to drive a car for 2-3 years and have it still be worth 70-80% of what you paid for is unheard of in any other brand I know of.",Honda-Invest in some good quality leather!

Cherokee had) but that is my only ""Wish"" - I'm not raving about the mileage, and it's obviously better than my 8cy, its just not THAT much greater - and I wish it had a little more ""oomph""   I LOVE the car -  Very happy - LOVE the Nav (didn't think I'd really use it) it helps a LOT from an ATM or gas location to a restaurant. So cool!!  Happy Owner here.","Leather steering wheel location & size is right for me as I'm short, reach to dash features is perfect, love the Nav, sunglasses holder, XM radio, and  leather seats are comfy.

I had read road noise was a problem for some people, but  the dronr i had with the stang must have made my ears numb to it cause it doesn't bother me at all.

It is very sporty, practical and for the most part comfortable. The 4 cyl engine should produce a more efficient mpg but 24-27 is almost double what we were getting in our V6 Liberty with almost as much power.

The all wheel drive is awesome on the snow. Love the handling and the functionality. The gas mileage is pretty decent. I get about 25-26 MPG highway and about 23-24 MPG city. It really depends on how you drive it. MPG indicator gauge can help with that. It could have a little more pickup. I notice it mainly on the highway but you can put it in D3 by pushing the button on the side of the gear to give you extra pick up. Overall, great car.","All wheel drive, digital indicator for engine oil life, handling, luggage area and extra compartments, cup holders in the back seat (absolute necessity with the kids, MP3 port, there are 2 other ports to charge phones or whatever.

My only compliant is that the road noise in this vehicle is almost unbearable.  I can't speak on the cell phone (even with headset) and the stereo has to be so loud to overcome the noise.  Honda needs to address this issue.  I think as American cars improve, they will be really hurt Honda by increasing cabin comfort.  Just took 800 mile road trip only got 23.5 MPG-disappointing.

The power level is fine, storage capacity is fine, handling and braking are excellent. Have also driven it on some snow covered roads and it felt very secure. I love the XM satellite radio. The leather still feels plasticky, but it is breaking in.

Gas mileage is ok for now (23 around town and 27 hwy) but I hope to get better mileage once it is broken in.  One thing I am disappointed in is the Bridgestone tires on the CRV.  They don't have very good traction at all in the snow.  If it wasn't for the AWD I would be sliding all over the road.  I can't believe Honda puts such a poor tire on their vehicles.  Other than the tires I really like my CRV.  It's fun to drive and a nice looking vehicle. ,The ipod port and the cargo space.,Definitely an upgrade on the tires.

Just took our first long trip (1800 miles) and thought it was time to write a review.  There is very little we don't like.  The CR-V replaced our Pontiac Montana - wanted something a little smaller, but not a car.  For a long trip that we make once a year, we missed the extra space, but for the rest of the year, it is great!  ","The car is fun to drive.  We were also looking at the Rav-4 and I liked how this afforded floor space between front seats for things like a purse.  It also felt smaller than a Rav-4, which I preferred.  For a 4 cyl it has pretty good get up and go!  Handles great in the snow and ice.","A 6 cyl option, the controls on the steering wheel need more light, a compass, auto headlights should be standard - that is one of my biggest pet peeves!

It is comfort, utility, style and dependability rolled into a nice neat package. Shortly after taking delivery we drove ""the Beaver"" trans continent for a total of 11K miles and it never skipped a beat. Mileage was spot on the ratings, but the power was peppier than I expected.

We selected CR-V for its roomy interior, high mileage and its standard configurations. Honda is simpler and EX-L had all the features we wanted and none we didn't care about. It was a great decision. The handling is so smooth that it feels like a car. The mileage is very close to sedan. We love all the luxury features come with it.",High mileage. Good luggage capacity in this class. Leather seats. Seats can lean far back. Car seat warmer. Visual indicator of door open.

The steering and the front view you get is the best! It has a very secure feel to it including when it's pouring rain. The only down fall to it is that even though it claims to make 22 city and 26 hwy miles (for gas) and it has only given me an average of 16 which means that I've had to refill my tank after only 250 miles. :( It should be at least after 350 miles. I don't drive much in the city so I was extremely concerned. I just spoke to two different Honda dealerships that told me that it takes up to 5000 miles on the car before it gives the average of 22-26 miles on gas. I was relieved to hear this news!!! ,"Favorite feature: the steering, easy to maneuver, the front view, it's practical, dependable and looks great!","Better gas mileage from the beginning (not having to wait until the engine is 'broken in'), better view from the back window, better view from the sides (blind spots), better latch on the truck (if it's not shut tight then you will not be able to engage the alarm) and have the back seats fold flat."

The car is sporty and fun to drive, easy to turn, and easy to convert for large items (I brought a huge self-propelled lawnmower home in the back of the car last week). My mileage is averaging 24.5 mpg. The car is quiet and the radio/CD sounds terrific. ","Love, love, love the entire car!","My only improvement recommendation to Honda would be to redesign the little window in the back. It does not aesthetically match the contour of the slope of the roof. In an artist's eye, it just doesn't do justice to the overall appearance of the car."
5,You Want This Vehicle,RobertM ,09/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I owned a 2006 Chevy Equinox and I traded up for this vehicle. I definitely traded up! The Chevy's interior left a lot to be desired and after a while I grew tired of the exterior as well. With my new CR-V I feel like I'm definitely driving in style. My main goal was to increase my mpg average without sacrificing space and comfort. I have a very large dog and thought a car might get better mileage, she would not have her own space. With the CR-V I get car style mileage and SUV style space. The perfect combination. If you're looking for that combination as well as great interior and exterior style and finish, then you've found the one to get. I've had it for two weeks now and have ZERO regrets.","Comfortable leather seats, great dual climate control, plenty of cargo space and flexibility, excellent mpg (have been averaging about 26 mpg), and stylish interior/exterior.","Stick shift might be a little more ""fun"" to drive. All 4 window auto up/down would be nice. A compass would be a nice finishing touch to the otherwise excellent trip computer."
4.5,A Great Alternative,EJS ,08/22/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,3,5,5,4,"We test drove a lot of SUV's-a lot.  The sticker shock was, well, shocking. With this Honda, though too small to classify as an SUV, was exactly what we were looking for.  The interior quality really sets it apart and was not seen anywhere in this price range. It is very roomy, drives exceptionally well, is quite nimble and gets good gas mileage.  However, it is woefully underpowered.   This ""car/suv"" is a great alternative to spending mid forties on another vehicle.  And what's really nice, in five years this Honda will have the same trade in value as that 45K SUV we liked and almost bought.   ","Quality or material. It has an Excellent ride, its very tight and it has the best crash and safety rating to keep my wife safe.

3.625,2009 Honda CRV,R.Kaminski ,08/19/2009,,,4,4,3,4,,3,3,5,3,"Not pleased with overall ride. Gas mileage excellent. Went on a 300 mile highway trip and crv was very bumpy, felt almost every bump on highway. Could hear the tires going over every bump inside the car. Outside noise extremely loud inside crv. Needs more insulation to eliminate noise. Headrest very uncomfortable. Other than that crv is ok. Will wait and see how brakes hold up. Other reviews complain about possible brake pads and rotor replacements sooner than most cars. Would not recommend this crv. Unfortunately daughter bought same car and she also experiences same loud noises.",Excellent gas mileage. Averaged 31 on recent highway trip.,Work on eliminating outside noises.
5,My First Honda,Harry ,08/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I'm really enjoying the CRV.  I've owned Toyotas for my last 5 vehicles and may become a long-term Honda fan.  This is a well designed and built vehicle.  The total package was the selling point: moonroof, stereo, privacy glass, alloys, fit and finish.  These were only available in the high end Outback.  I go on my first road trip tomorrow and am anxious to see what the gas mileage is.  Highly recommend!","Handling, stereo, moonroof. Rav4 steering is electric and feels unnatural. CRV has great steering feedback.  There is enough power for conservative driving.  Made in Ohio!","Some of the EX-L options.  Get rid of the center tray, add lumbar adjust to cloth seats, side moulding and door-edge moulding should be standard equipment."
4.75,Best Value & Performance,motoguy128 ,08/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I compared the Nissan Rogue and RAV4 to the CR-V.  For the price, I felt the EX 4WD trim offered the best value compared to the competition.  It handles like a much smaller vehicle.  Coming from a Nissan Versa, it often feels more nimble and easier to maneuver.  The Rogue was a little more responsive once rolling, but the CR-V feels more responsive off the line.","Excellent steering feel and response.  Steering weighted just right!!!  Nice interior materials, Well shaped seat, great visibility sitting high without any large blind spots, and very stable feeling on higher speed turns like on ramps.  The suspension really follows the bumps in the road.","Could use a 2.5L with a little more ""meat"" in the bottom end, to hold gears with a load or up hills.  The transmission has to downshift on almost any hill.  The tall 5th gear is great for cruising, but I wonder if it's a little too tall.  A/C could be more powerful.  Manual 4WD lock would be nice."
5,31 MPG From Albany to Riverside,tsamoni ,08/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am a new father and traded in my Civic Coupe for a family-friendly, but fun-to-drive CR-V. On a recent trip to Albany, NY to Riverside, NJ (250 miles) I averaged 31 MPG--not too bad for a car that is a lot heavier than my 35MPG Civic. This car is great for the guy who is in his early 30's, just starting a family, and who can't see himself in a minivan or a Sedan like the Accord or Camry (too old manish and boring).  I have plenty of room for all my daughter's stuff and enough left over for my passengers--even with a car seat installed.  Overall, this is a great compromise between style and fun, and necessity and practicality.  The CR-V guarantees I will be a Loyal Honda Owner forever!","Cruise Control is Standard--great for fuel economy.  Huge trunk.  Safety, Safety, Safety!  It's not a minivan!",These are NOT a big deal when you consider the whole package!  6-Disc Changer should not be optional. Not everyone likes iTunes and MP3s.  Speedometer--use increments of 5 not 2.  Some of the console storage is too small.  Interior fabric could be a bit softer
3.375,Wood seats would be more comfortable,bobincinti ,08/18/2009,,,1,5,5,5,,4,1,5,1,"I have written a previous review about this vehicle.  This has to be one of the most uncomfortable vehicles I have owned.  So bad that I traded in a 8 month old 2009 CRV with 12,150 miles for a Mercury Mariner.  Dealer said I was the first to trade this vehicle in because there was no data on 2009 trades.   My biggest complaint on this car is that they seats are like rocks.  I drive 60+ miles per day and bought it for the gas mileage.  I was averaging 25.3 mpg, but I was driving a 2001 Nissan Frontier with 162,000 miles more than I was driving this vehicle.  I simply hated driving this car.  ",Gas mileage.,Make the car seat more comfortable.  Quit sloping the dash away from the driver.

Price was right - $21,100 for an LX AWD plus tax and title.    We have about 4,000 miles on our other CR-V and still have 60% of our oil life remaining.   The CR-V was easy to drive in the winter and we didn't have any trouble with driving in the snow.",Very easy to drive. Easy to fold down the rear seats. Has terrific safety features. System which tells you when you need an oil change or when you have low tire pressure.,A sturdier center console with a storage compartment for CDs. Mileage could be better as we are only getting about 20 mpg in mostly city driving. Rear window visibility could be better (I have knocked over our plastic garbage cans a couple of time backing out of the driveway!)
4.125,As advertised,hack ,08/11/2009,,,4,4,4,5,,4,3,5,4," We recently drove from Minnesota to Maine via Canada, down the East Coast and back to the Midwest with our two kids.  Most of what you hear about the CRV is true.  There is pronounced road noise on rough pavement, though smooth pavement is fine.  The engine has pep in city driving, but acceleration can be sluggish and the engine can feel over-matched on highway merging and some hills - passing is fine.  The suspension and seats are a bit stiff,  the low-beam lights are poor, but the driver's view, cabin lay-out, and the responsiveness of the steering are excellent. Easily fit a month's worth of gear. Biggest surprise?  Very good mileage 28 - 32 at 70+ on the highway. Not a luxury vehicle.  ","Smooth transmission, cabin lay-out, responsive steering and room. Pleasantly surprised with fuel efficiency thus far on the highway.  I am careful, but not slow, and it's been much better than advertised.","Even with the upgraded stereo/speakers on the EX, low-end sound is very tough to pick up and the sound quality hurts my ears.  I wish I could have gotten a better stereo w/out trim upgrade. Engine is mostly fine, a bit more horsepower would be better.  Even so, felt it was much better than the RAV."

I also own a Civic, while a great car with great mileage, it's getting to be too small to be convenient for my family and my dog. Being the first SUV, I was afraid it might be too big to get use to if I switch, but I was surprised to find that CRV drives not much different than my Civic, except much roomier, plenty of space for your legs, head, arms and stuff! Front console is great with useful displays, and the design is very sharp and attractive. Now I look forward drive/riding in my new CRV in the morning to work. Oh I am still trying to improve the mileage by using cruise control. It's decent.","Instant mpg and average mpg display, outside temperature display, stereo console with button on steering wheel.

The wife preferred the look of the CR-V over the Forester.  Since it's primarily her car we went with the CR-V.  I was most concerned about the lack of power (I drive an '09 Murano).  However, it packs plenty of punch for her daily needs.  It's amazing how spacious the interior feels on such a small frame.  This is a perfect vehicle for driving around town, but I prefer the smooth ride of my Murano on a long drive.  The handling is superb for an SUV, which makes it fun to drive.  I was concerned about rear visibility w/o the backup camera, but it's fine.  Make sure you check out the Forester too. ",Handling! Access (strapping in the kids and driving height).

The 09 ""seems"" smaller in the cargo area - but upon putting the cargo tray from the 02 into the 09 - it's actually the same size.  The difference is that the 09 has support shelves for the cargo shelf that stick out into the trunk area.  The hatch also slopes - so you lose some space.  In addition, the EX is missing the hooks that the 02 had (to hang grocery bags).  The 09 is missing dash storage - but the dash is much better designed - I can reach the radio controls without leaning forward.  Note - the Honda supplied floor mats are junk!  After 1500 miles, I've worn out the carpet pile.  The mats on my 02 looked brand new after 7 years.

We've owned other Hondas and every one has been bullet proof.  We chose another Honda because of our positive experiences with our local dealer and service department and because our Civic and previous Accord have never required any service other than routine maintenance (affordable even after the warranty has expired).

I really liked the Santa Fe for the money, but I drive cars 10-15 years, and felt better about Honda's long term reliability. I have not noticed the road noise problem I have read about.  The CRV is fun to drive, and does very well on the interstate. I like the maintenance minder, mpg display, etc. The ride and seats are a little firmer than I like (67 yrs old), but not that uncomfortable. My only problem was ""rail rust"" in the paint on top. I used a clay bar to help remove it. I do not understand why the top can't be covered in transit. So far, very satisfied.","Considering it is a small SUV, I like the way it handles on the interstate. The four cylinder is smooth and has enough power for my driving. I like the maintenance minder and associated displays. The seating space is good in both front and back, with some rear cargo space still left .","No real complaints, other than more protection during shipping.

I really loved those cars, but not this one. It averages about 18mpg (inc. hwy), the temperature controls have to be reset each time, I wish it had an analog dashboard, and there is a serious hesitation right before acceleration. The mirrors are skewed in some way which makes it difficult to park--I have no problem like this in any other car.

Rav4 is more powerful, quieter, roomier, fuel efficient and my brains were for it, but my heart went for CRV and still happier after two weeks. Of course CRV looks better too and is exciting to get into CRV and take it for a spin.",1. Intuitive Dashboard controls. 2. Zippier and fun to drive 3. Exterior look. 4. 6 CD changer ,1. Wider armrests 2. Subwoofer to be made standard in EX. 3. Fuel efficiency needs to improve for city driving. Currently I get 14mpg for city and 30mpg on highways. 5. The left arm rests circle shaped holder bulges too much in front taking some leg space away.
4.5,Great mileage in a tough economy,melissa0414 ,06/01/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,3,5,5,"I purchased the 2009 CRV EX just a week ago.  I had a 2004 Xterra (which got, at best, 17 mpg's highway).  I figured instead of spending $400/mo in gas this summer, I needed something more practical, but did not want to compromise on size.  The CRV is just as big inside, if not bigger, than the Xterra.  Although it appears much smaller on the outside?  Love the digital display...it has current mpg's, average mpg's (on that tank), tire pressure monitor, and the Maintenance Meter (reminds you to get your oil changed, etc).  Does not have a center 'console.'  Instead it's a drop-down walk-through (like a minivan would have).  The 2.4L 4-banger really has some pep comparable to my old V6.","MPG's, for sure...averaging 25.8 mpg's (about 50/50 town/highway) on the first tank!!  Handling is great.  8 cup holders...awesome.  A lot of standard features (even on the base model) like power, tire pressure monitor, digital display.  Price, when I thought Honda was always too much $$, was great.","More comfort in the seats...very stiff.  Offer GRAY interior on the 'urban titanium' exterior (only offered that manilla folder color or solid black).  GROUND NOISE is bad.  But every Honda I've ever been in has had the same issue, just didn't expect it in a 'higher ground clearance' vehicle.  "
4.75,Great crossover vehicle,Scott ,05/27/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Have had the CRV for 1 month.  Couldn't be happier. Always owned Hondas and know their reliability and resale value.  The biggest adjustment was going from my 2006 civic 30mph to 22 mph.  I know I'll be happy this winter with the AWD.  A little surprised a 4 cyl doesn't  get better mileage but the confidence and satisfaction with Honda compensates nicely.  Bottom line is you get what you pay for and the value of what you get is great.  The Hyundai's and Kia's boast a lower price and EXTREMELY limited 100,000 mi. warranty.  But my brother in law is a Mercedes specialist and says he doesn't get many Hondas but the Koreans come in frequently and have bad corrosion problems down the road.",Love the ride and the real time AWD.  Especially like the spare being inside and not back mounted as in previous years.,Make mirrors and door handles painted on all EX models.  Put the console between the seats back in for extra storage.  As in most Japanese cars an extra inch or two in leg room would be nice.

I consider it a real bargain. In the first couple of weeks of ownership and after only one long trip I can find no faults.","Creature comforts, layout, sunroof, navigation, fit and finish... well, I like it all.","I really don't like the digital displays for coolant temperature and gasoline tank, but I'll get used to them."

4.625,Fits like a glove,Jackie ,05/23/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,5,5,I love this car. I went from my Acura Integra to this and was not intimated. I've not had to get used to driving it because it practically drives itself. The view is great and everything is easy to reach. The alignment needs to be adjusted and will do that tomorrow. It pulls to the right on some roads within 3 seconds on others it drifts within 6 seconds it's in the other lane. I'm getting 25.7 an 25.8 MPG which is right around what I was getting with my 15 year old 1994 Integra. They are highway miles though with some morning commute (bumper to bumper). Of course I take it easy when I drive. No gunning like a bat out of hell. It's a great car. I expect to keep it for 15 years like my Acura.,Gas mileage. Easy to drive. Roomy. Leather interior.

It replaced a 94 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 170K miles. As of now the MPG's are at 22 but this is only local driving. The voice recognition system needs some improvement. It rarely gets the command right the 1st time. I'm surprised at the amount of road noise inside & this might be a factor with the voice commands.  We also have a new 09 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 2dr. The Jeep is much quieter & has less road noise at 60MPH. We usually keep a vehicle for 15 yrs or more so I hope it'll last. My wife drives the CR-V 90% of the time. ",On a nice day we love to open the sun roof. The Nav. system is great but takes some getting use to. Also like the back-up camera. My wife loves the heated seats.  The rear storage & back seat fold down is wonderful. Overall we both love driving the CR-V. ,Could be much quieter inside. In reading some of the reviews owners complained about the factory Continental tires. Maybe those are a source of the road noise.  The voice recognition system needs improvement. A tinted w/s would be nice.  
4.875,I'm surprised... I like it!,kimberkook ,05/20/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The CR-V is my first SUV. It was purchased to deal with the deep winter snows we've been getting here more often.

5,I Love My CR-V EX-L AWD,JerseyGirl ,05/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"When shopping around for a new crossover vehicle, I also considered Toyota RAV4 & Hyundai Santa Fe. RAV4 was too small, leather seats were uncomfortable, interior was disappointing - cheap looking - tire cover on back is ugly. Santa Fe priced right, roomy, comfortable; however didn't like ""fake wood"" on dashboard and doors. Made interior look old fashioned. CR-V EXL 4 door AWD came standard with leather package including moon roof, rear storage cover, floor mats & other extras were all included in price, not add-ins like the RAV4. The 4 cylinder has just as much acceleration power as competitors V6's.  Handles well on curves. Plenty of storage spaces. Sufficient leg room in front and back.",Stereo system phenomenal with subwoofer. Can clearly hear all instruments playing. Love the moon roof - good for those days when it's too cool to open all windows yet not hot enough for a/c. Enjoy sporty feel driving on highway. Smooth ride on city streets. Great gas mileage. Borrego beige hides dirt.,"Very slight hesitation when pressing gas to go faster. Paint by door handle chips easily from fingernails. Should consider adding automatic garage door opener buttons on visor, as well as a light on visor mirrors."

I can't believe people have complained of road noise-this auto is so quiet!  Handling is immediate and sure-footed.  Acceleration is superb.  Interior design is great - all controls are clearly marked and easily reached by the driver and front seat passenger.  Don't forget!

3.875,"It's ok, but needs much improvement",its ok ,05/14/2009,,,5,4,4,4,,3,4,3,4,"So I have about 8k miles on this cr-v. It is ok so far but is begging for improvement. First off the gas mileage is no where near advertised unless you are going to drive pure interstate which I rarely do. My driving is 65% highway (at 65mph-70mpg) and I've been averaging 20 mpg. I did drive this car pure city before and got approx 18mpg. Next is the engine. Do not even think about passing someone with this SUV. The engine is very underpowered, it's almost like this car is begging for a v6. However, the engine is very smooth, and very quiet below 75mph. Ride wise this is a firm ride, Honda could have made the suspension a little softer. Finally THE ROAD NOISE! On the Highway it is very loud. ","Looks nice from the outside, great seating design, fun to drive. ","Very underpowered engine, solve the road noise problem. If it is windy outside, it gets much worse. Make a smoother shifting transmission, it can be hesitant and shift roughly if you demand power from it. "

My wife and I both have had spine surgery, The seats are very comfortable, the shift is placed towards the top, you don't have to lean over to shift gears.

I am averaging just around 20 MPG.  The average meter moves up very slowly on the freeways and I seemed to max out at 21 MPG.  However, it plummets rapidly when driving in the city getting around 15MPG.  This is a lot worse than the 2008 Equinox that I was driving and it was a V6 with a lot more power and interior room. The other reviews are correct about the limited storage option in the CRV.  Honda really needs to put in a coin holder.  The three slots that are at knee level are small and difficult to access.  Actually, they are kind of useless. ",MP3 jack.  ,Coin holder.  Road noise is horrible!  I get a headache from the noise after about 30 minutes on the freeway.  Needs a smoother ride.

4.875,Top-of-the-line Model w/ Navigation,Glenn ,04/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Overall excellent vehicle.  Honda attention to design and reliability is well-known.  My only concern with a design flaw is in regard to the optional roof rack (see my note below for suggested improvement).  MPG tends to vary from manufacturer ratings.  Inner city = 14-15 mpg; suburban city = 20-21 (rated at 20); highway = 30-33 (rated at 27).  I was pleasantly surprised with a maximum of 33 MPG highway (60-65 mph) for Interstate driving; I recommend the high-end EX-L w/ Navigation, as well as optional fog lamps, mud flaps, all-weather & cargo mats; body-side molding; & Remote starter.  Avoid the base model, as it won't hold resale value - opt for the EX with leather and/or navigation.","[1] Navigation [2] Voice control for audio, climate, & navigation",[1] Inner city MPG needs improvement; [2] Bluetooth for cell phones; [3] Create future hybrid version?

After research between a Toyota Rav4 & Honda CR-V. Test drove both, especially at night for low beam headlamps in deer country. Both tested well but felt the Honda was a bit better in comfort & mileage and details for the money.  Several customers said the service at this dealership was great. We have been getting 24.8 in the commute/town driving and the one road trip of 360 miles I got 29.8 doing around 70. We loved the Cruiser, but already like this one better.  It is roomy and well built and has all the appointments needed.  Arm rests & visors could be wider, but that's all we see needed after 3 mo. ","Great mileage, comfort of ride, visibility, feel sturdy, and standard features seem to be a bit more than on most vehicles.  Like the rubber tray in the rear compartment for catching spills.  We are over 60 and getting in and out is real easy, and lots of cargo room.","Bigger wider arm rests on front seats, and visors that have extenders to cover more sun up.

5,What I was looking for!,hey sis ,04/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I test drove most similar sized models so that I could have my own comparison information.  I chose the CRV because of the value for my dollar.  I have been thrilled with the performance so far (6 weeks). I live in outer suburbs, so gas mileage was an important factor and so far I am averaging around 21 MPG in town.  I have not taken it cross-country but am sure that I will be happy with those results too.","Overall comfort, mpg, sunroof and radio.",I have resolved the lack of a change tray by converting one of the cubbies in to a change catcher.

We bought the EXL and are glad we did - added extras are worth the money. We looked at both the CRV & the Rav4 for several weeks before we bought. We know we made the right choice. Everything about this car is quality. We love our CRV -- The engine does the job quite well - it's not a hod rod and we did not purchase this vehicle thinking we could go 0-60 in 4 seconds.

4.875,Typical Honda - top quality automobile,scottg ,02/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've been a long time Honda owner (since 86) and the 09 CR-V EX-L with nav has met my expectations for what to expect from Honda - top quality automobiles.  Had the CR-V for 2 months now, put 2000 miles on it. It's a solid car with an excellent fit and finish. The engine has plenty of power and the transmission shifts very smoothly.  The controls and display are well laid out and nicely colored. The nav system is fast and the display is bright. The sound system is outstanding, plenty of watts for the size of the car.  Driver's seat is very comfortable. The leather seat is more comfortable than cloth.  Gas mileage so far hasn't been great, 18/24 but maybe will improve in warmer weather. ","PCMCIA card slot for listening to MP3s, heated seats, very sharp instrument panel, well thought out overall controls.","Softer ride - can be a bit jolting on bumpy surfaces.  Missing equipment - Bluetooth handsfree phone interface, homelink, memory for driver's seat.  Better tires - Continental 4x4 Contacts, not well rated.

3.625,Most uncomfortable vehicle I have owned,bobincinti ,02/25/2009,,,3,4,4,4,,5,1,4,4,"I purchased my CRV in November.  After driving it for about 5,000 miles, I have decided that I can't stand this vehicle and will be selling it.  The ride is too stiff, the seats are uncomfortable, the dash board slopes away from the driver.  I drive a lot and while I like this vehicle, I am not comfortable in this car.   Too bad the dealer would not allow me more than a 10 mile test drive.  If I could of test drove this car for a couple of days, I would not have bought it.   But live and learn.

I'm 6'5"" and am very impressed with the interior space - both as a driver and front seat passenger. For a 4cyl w/165hp, this thing is fun to drive. We were looking for an AWD vehicle with ample cargo space and the Honda fit the bill. Compared it to the Ford Flex and Chevy Equinox. The fact that Honda had sharp lease deals played a role, but the overall ratings and reviews for the CR-V put it over the top. We've had the car < 1 week, so this is obviously a first impression --- so far, we are very happy.",Interior leg / head room. Back seat configuration (kids love the reclining feature).,Give in and add the cargo shelf to the LX model (can't be that big of an expense).
4.5,A great vehicle for the price,Chet ,02/07/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,After three weeks I'm generally pleased with the over all performance of the car. Seating is much better then my old 2001 CRV. Not having the spare tire hanging on the back door is a plus. The handling is excellent on dry roads and also on snow covered streets. Power is adequate for a 4-cyl engine. A much better vehicle then the Toyota or Subaru competition.,"Ride and handling,overall fit and finish And hopefully Hondas reliability.",A different tire then the Brickstones.
4.25,It's just OK,Will ,02/03/2009,,,4,3,5,5,,5,4,4,4,I purchased the CR-V  about a month ago and find it OK. It has horrible road noise and a very jumpy ride on rough roads. I do not like the shape of the rear side window. Gas mileage is only fair 21 around town.  I traded in a 2005 Toyota Camry and in many ways liked the Camry better. The Bridgestone tires on this vehicle get a very poor rating.  I am surprised that Honda would put these tires on this vehicle. ,"XM radio, heated seats, power drivers seat, nicely equipped.","Better tires, reduce the terrible road noise and improve ride on bumpy roads"
4.75,"Finally, a great choice from the get-go!",Mark ,02/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"After much research, and trying to make a decision between the RAV4 and the Honda, I chose to go with the Honda and absolutely have no regrets.  I am a 6'4"" male, and this vehicle is a perfect fit for me.  I traded in a Toyota Matrix.  After some pretty severe Midwest winters, I knew I wanted to get back into an SUV.  (I had a Mountaineer before the Matrix).  This is one of the best handling vehicles that I have ever owned.  For continuous winter driving in town I am getting 18-19 miles per gallon.  I had several colors to choose from, and I opted for the Urban Titanium Metallic.  This color hides the dirt better than some of the darker colors.  ",I like the way the hatch opens as opposed to the RAV4.  The CD system is fabulous.  I think the instrument panel has a nice lighting effect.  Overall the vehicle seems like a very well built vehicle.,The latching of the hatchback.  Sometimes I have to slam it in order for it to shut. I wish Honda would consider making the CR-V a Hybrid.

4.75,Ideal Small SUV,Newbie ,01/31/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I'm a Toyota person having owned and loved my Highlander and other Toyotas over the years, but I wanted a smaller SUV. The Rav4 has a bit better ""fit and finish"" and lots to like, but I did not want the rear door that opens like a car door nor the tire there. The AWD CR-V handles very well in snow, and the 4 cyl engine performs well enough for me. The CRV is the perfect size for me. It looks beautiful to me and gives a panoramic view of the road like other SUVs. It's safety record is tops.","rear door, superior radio/CD player, heated front seats, large alloy wheels, center console, power driver seat with lumbar support, leather, cargo tray (extra), dual deck cargo shelf, ABS, tire-pressure monitoring system (saved me already), heated exterior mirrors; excellent included package; price","flashing turn lights on mirrors, a little less ""jostling"" and ""road feel,"" front splash guards should be included in the price; rear seats should fold flat"
4.75,From minivan to CRV,MB ,01/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,It has been an adjustment for me after driving a minivan for 12 years. Needed some cargo room for hockey equipment but did not want to drive a minivan anymore. This vehicle fills the need. Interior room is terrific considering the size of the vehicle. Handles very well in all kinds of weather and snow. Comfortable front and back seats and nice ride for the money.,Interior layout is comfortable and roomy for size of vehicle. Heated leather seats are nice and the arm rest is ideal. Controls are attractive and convenient. Overall nice car for the money.,Lighted vanity mirrors.  Defrost on the wiper blades. Trouble with the wipers icing up and long time to defrost entire windshield. Outlet for cell phone charging should charge when car is off. Slightly stronger engine and better city/highway gas mileage (averaging 20).
5,Update to my Previous Review.,John Allen Albree ,01/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"In my first review, I stated that my first tank of fuel netted 20 mpg in the city. Further driving of all types now reveals that city driving is 23-24 mpg and interstate driving at 70 mph and below is at 28.8 mpg. This is terrific and I could not be more pleased with this car. It is outstanding in every area. ","The feel of the car on the road at 70mph is secure, safe, and smooth. Little road noise. Superb leather seats with great back support. XM radio is outstanding quality. The exterior design is beautiful and the interior is functional and handsome. What a GREAT automobile.","Still wish I had the auto-dimming rear view mirror and auto headlights. Otherwise, I have NO complaints of any kind."
4.25,Initial Impressions After 1 Month,Andy ,01/02/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"Firstly I'm pretty picky and I haven't had the car long. The driver's seat could use better lumbar support and a bit more leg room. Cloth seat durability is ? + meant for smaller person. Backup sensor add-on although nice isn't something really needed. Its not hard to get used to backing it up. Cheap carpet floor mats are not going to last long. Rear door doesn't latch w/o slamming. Addon compass/rear view mirror sits too high on window. Too close to top console (no clearance). Wind impacts mileage a LOT. Very limited range (350ish and much less in wind). Bit rough shifting out of 1st sometimes. Braking is great. Handles well. Good visibility. For its size, I like the car. Hard to beat new.","The red is a great color. Looks ok with light dirt. Car has good pep for a 4 cyl. Easily good enough for getting onto+for hwy. The front seat will lay flat. It would need seat protection I think it would allow 2x4's to be carried. Has good cargo space and even with my whining, it is comfortable.",Allow key fob to lock doors with drv door open. Bigger gas tank! Figure out how to ground things to eliminate static shock. Change radio-steering mode button to scan. Higher speedometer resolution. Add adj seats in CLOTH to ex. Add coin holder. Add center box vs folddown to ex. 
5,Awesome,scherrywade ,01/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This CR-V is absolutely awesome.  It is beautiful in design and comfort and has all the extras I wanted.  I have grandchildren and it is perfect.  My sister just bought one too.  The EX-L is just gorgeous and handles like a dream.  Can't go wrong with this one for price and luxury.  I only buy Honda and this one is the best!,The way the dash is set up and the height for getting in and out.,Can't find any yet.  Maybe adding power seat to passenger side. 
5,Another Outstanding Honda,John Allen Albree ,12/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,CR-V is Alabaster Silver with gray leather. The ride is very quiet and much better then my 2008 Honda Accord EX-L which I traded in. My wife loves the seats and the vehicle tracks beautifully on the interstate. The first tank of gas only local driving was an acceptable 20 mpg.The XM sound system is better than before. Transmission is smooth and quiet. We love this car.,"Sound system, quiet engine, no road noise and smooth ride. You just have to experience the ride to understand my comments. Seats are supportive and of high quality leather. We purchased no options - you don't need them.","I miss having a compass, I miss the auto-dim mirror. Need brighter lights on steering wheel buttons. I miss the auto-setting for head lights. It seems strange to me that the CR-V EX-L would not have these items as does the 2008 Honda Accord EX-L. In spite of the above, we still love the purchase. "
4.375,CR-V review,bobincinti ,12/30/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"I recently purchased my CRV in Nov 2008 to replace an aging Nissan Frontier.  While the vehicle drives well and gets great fuel economy (about 25 mpg), there are some minor things that bother me.  The seats are very stiff and get to be uncomfortable on long drives, the dash slants away from the driver, so you have to lean forward to get to the the controls (radio, HVAC, etc) and the external mirrors are too small.  They LX model has a foldable tray, for about $10 in material they could have put in a full center console as well.  Other than those minor issues, this is a great vehicle.

4.625,Great First Impressions!,Ron ,12/26/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"Have owned several Accords both 4 and 6 cyl. Always great performers but I now need AWD (Colorado mountains/plains) and storage room. 27/32 HWY and 22/24 urban - REALLY. Very impressed w/power and trans. in mountain and normal terrain. Big guy, it is comfortable and stability is outstanding; w/performance in windy conditions surprisingly good. Have not had any snow to test in yet. Compared with Forester (lousy 4 spd trans.) almost went w/it anyway, Rav4 (not as stable and the swing out rear door is dangerous) and Edge (lousy mpg but felt substantial).     ","Generally: size/functionality, solid quality, styling, room and visibility.  Specifically: transmission (smooth with an outstanding power curve for a 4 cyl., MPG better than sticker - really. Interior controls are very functional and accessible.","I bought the EX-L AWD w/o nav. But at this level would expect a compass, self dimming rear view mirror, auto headlamps and homelink.

4.875,Utility and practicality can't be beat,highway24 ,12/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"I carefully considered the Forrester, the RDX, and the Jetta TDI wagon.  I came to my senses and committed to the CRV and I'm loving it.  The reviews mention a slow 0-60.  I haven't noticed much lag in city traffic.  The 0-35 I have to do almost every other block around town is zippy.  I love the look of the redesigned CRV.  They borrowed from the best.  The sculpted hood, the curves and points of the headlights...very appealing.  Tail-lights were transitioned from an earlier model which evoke the design of certain Volvos.  Mileage is around 23 mixed. Hint: go with good gas.  I noticed a remarkable drop in engine noise when I didn't skimp and that V-Tec 4 went butter soft, in a good way.","I love the aesthetics of the exterior design (the hood spoiler accessory makes it a frugal cousin of the X3), the utility of the interior design, nice stereo, excellent air-flow for climate control, low engine noise (w/good gas), and a black plastic composite bumper for parallel parking in the city.","I wonder if they can design the center (folding) tray so that it doesn't rattle whatever you place on it. Still, glad to have it.  Nit-picking: The steering wheel thickens in diameter just below the 10:00 and 2:00 positions.  My hands, rather than settling into those spots, tend to avoid them."

I traded in a Forester which was only 2 years old and I am pleased with the performance and comfort of the CRV. Plenty of power for commuting and super comfortable on the road. Very quiet and smooth ride (unlike Forester). Seats are so comfortable. Plenty of room for 4 adults too. Love the XM radio.

4.5,None,Bob N. Whitehall Pa ,11/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,2,5,"Have driven 1600 miles. Added Remote start and Back-up sensors at the dealer. Two things really bother me. I am getting no better gas mileage with this 4 cyl on the highway than the 3.9 6 cyl Impala I turned in. The other thing is the Remote start. Why would you have to turn off the engine before you can open the door and get in. You have to restart the car. Double work for the battery and starter. On the GM vehicle you just enter the car and insert the key and drive away. Come on Honda, if GM can do it, so can you. If they can correct this and add a 6 cyl like the Rav-4, I think I would be close to a perfect vehicle in this class.","Satellite radio, Back-up sensors and the Remote start turning on heated mirrors, rear defrosters and front windshield defrosters.

I am getting 21-22 mpg (mostly city driving) but I've only owned the car for 3 weeks.  Hopefully, that will improve a little as time goes on. I just added two accessories, the roof rack and the moon roof visor which really added to the overall appearance of the car. I traded in a Pontiac G-6 for my CRV.  All of my groceries fit into this car - all $350.00 worth!  I test drove a Pontiac Torrent, and a Rav4 before the Honda.  I definitely made the right choice.  Love it!","Love the steering - very zippy!  It reminds me of my husband's old Honda Prelude.  I still hear about how ""I never should have traded that car in!""

We bought the CR-V because we thought it was really functional given our lifestyle (baby and two dogs).  It was one of the few small suvs that could comfortably fit our car seat behind the front passenger seat.  That, combined with Honda's rep for reliability and safety, sealed the deal.  We've driven it for 2 weeks now and really enjoy the ride.  The only negatives are that the sight lines to the rear aren't ideal (but they are more than acceptable).  Also, the seats aren't the most comfortable/luxurious, but neither are they uncomfortable.  We got the LX trim level, however, so that's to be expected.",,
