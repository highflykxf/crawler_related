But there are quite a few rattling noises from dash,2nd and 3rd row seats. It's definitely not as serious as mechanical or electrical problem but sometimes is quite annoying. Dealer said it's from under seats and cannot fix due to safety issue.Another problem is the very weird tire size. They're top expensive. Change a set will charge $955 at Costco and $1000 at America Tire.Basically it's a comfortable and fast car but Toyota can make it better.","Exterior size is not too big/not too small, quiet (except rattles) inside, 3rd seat is not very narrow for adults, material quality is no cheap, rear window is big so it's easy to see when doing reverse","Rattles and squeezes: Wish Toyota can do more test drive at their design center and teach dealers how to fix them

4.625,Great SUV!,Tony the tester ,11/17/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"We love our Highlander I4 with convenience package. This car has all the features I need and nothing you don't need-perfect. We love the space and comfort, ride quality and general feel of this car. The assembly quality is first rate. It had defective water pump after one year but it is one of the first ones that they put together. In any case, it didn't stop in the middle of the road. The 4 cyl engine is great. It is quiet, and powerful enough to pull full load on our 1000 mile trip. It lacks a passing power a bit but it is a great cruiser and plenty of pep around town. Efficiency was as low as 19 mpg and as high as 29 mpg. Road feel is good but 6 spd transmission is too shift-happy but smooth.","We love the interior design, comfort and space. 17 inch wheels definitely make ride better then available 19'', which we didn't take. This car has set of 5 tires, so if the tire rated for 50K miles, using 5 of them you can go 60K. Heated windshield for the wipers is a great add-on. ","I could hardly think of one area where this car is weak, besides, may be, the transmission, which downshifts at slightest upgrade. I would love it to give me some time to accelerate to the desired speed using same gear. Also, the darkest upholstery could be darker but Toyota fixed it for 2011."

Unbelievable! The sound will drive you  nuts and they cannot fix it,, they said it is in MOST all their vehicles and if they replace the problem which they agree there is, it will just come back because that is the design of th e gear box!

I travel for work and find this vehicle so much more comfortable and versatile than my 07 Chevy Impala LTZ.  It gets great gas mileage; best I've ever gotten is 28 mpg, but usually average around 25 per tank.  The back seat is extremely spacious, even for me measuring in at 6'5"". I find the in dash information center to be very user friendly, even though it could have a bigger display. V6 acceleration is excellent for size and weight of vehicle. Handling is car-like with the sports trim level. Only major complaint is the lack of a compass for the price tag of this model.","The heated leather seats are very comfortable, JBL sound system sound s great, Bluetooth is extremely easy to use.

I cannot express how impressed I am with Highlander! The ride is extraordinarily comfortable, quite and smooth. The interior is extremely roomy, well-designed and functional. The second row is exceptional. If you need the third row it is there and not as a joke! If you do not use it just fold it and you have plenty of cargo room! I must also compliment the instant V6 power and above average fuel economy, which is almost the same as 2007 Passat I traded in!

My Highlander has made eight trips to the dealer to address problems. The problems: defective gas tank, of all things, which had to be replaced; incorrect fuel gauge reading (on its second sending unit and still not fixed); dis- colored dash panels; on its second XM receiver and all within 5,000 miles. The Dealer has been very helpful, but perplexed at times at the Highlander's oddities. Now, I wonder if the unintended acceleration bug will be next! I did not have as many problems with the Buick I traded in on this Highlander.

I have problems with the idle on the car and they have not repaired (I have video of this issue). I have a problem with mice entering the vents and entering the car because the vents do not close when you shut the car off (Poor Design). The tires are very poor in the snow and only last about 25,000 miles. I put on Michelin tires and what a difference. The car engine has plenty of power and is not to bad on using fuel for a V6.

I have NEVER owned a vehicle with such a sound no matter how cold the engine, yet I have had the dealer check it twice but I am guessing they never took it off the lot.

4.875,Most Practical SUV You Can Cuy.,Sixbee ,02/06/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Toyota has proven that they put a lot of thought into their design with every cubic inch of the inside being carefully thought out.  Seat comfort is great, leg room is never an issue, even for a 5'8"" adult in the 3rd row.  2nd row recline is much easier to operate than the competitors.  The car handles exceptionally, even with 19"" wheels in 6 to 8"" of snow, with the snow button on it is hard to make the car lose control.  Hands free controls and individual climate controls are a plus.  I am convinced for the money and the quality of this vehicle, you won't find a better car.  From it's lower priced ""rivals"" from Kia & GM to overpriced imports such as Acura and Lexus, the Highlander is IT!","Heated seats, individual climate control, added traction control for snow and other cold weather items, tow capacity, diverse seating options, and great sound system.","20"" WHEELS!!!

This was my first non big 3 SUV.  I think the interior is ok in terms of design.  The heating/ac panel is complicated to use.  The windows make visibility a little more difficult than I would like.  The transmission has some interesting options to downshift and upshift, but it is unclear as to the benefits.  The performance in snow is awful. I have no idea how this has a good snow rating, worse than most cars I have had.  The owners manual is very uninformative as to some of the most important features of the case.

",Back up camera is a good safety feature. Love the glove box-holds everything the wife throws in and then has room for what belongs there.

But the biggest trouble is that the Sport and Limited levels (including hybrids) have 19 inch wheels with odd size tires.  There is basically 2 tires to choose from, plus a few snow tires.  That's the only choice you have, and these tires are scary on snow.  I have my tires rotated at the dealer, and from their write up, it'll probably last 20,000 miles in which case will cost almost $1,000 to replace (not easy to find either). Wish the space behind third row was longer as well as split third row to make it more usable.  I think the Honda Pilot would be a better choice.","Sunroof, rear view camera, styling, good gas mileage, ability to open rear glass hatch.","Split third row capability, ability to enter third row from both sides (only on passenger side currently), move third row forward to gain more space behind it, definitely need more tire choices (Toyota Venza has same size and is in the same boat).

After all, it cost over 30k and almost 40k for fully load AWD sport model. Nav screen is not clear/vivid, perhaps due to touch screen?  Did I mention the ride is awesome?  I suggest ordering black leather/cloth interior since other color look cheap.  Go test drive MDX and RX.  If you need a roomier car, highlander should be your pick.

I was definitely in the market for an SUV this go around and was seriously looking and comparing and researching so that I might keep this one longer than 2 years!  I drove the Volvo XC60, MDX, RX 350, and Audi Q5.  I loved the Highlander though and the price was the best.  I have a loaded AWD with Nav for 36000.

We drove the Base, Sport and Limited models and the ride seems the same in all 3.  We liked the features that the Sport model gave us that the base model does not provide but finding a Sport was hard to do.  The dealers said this was due to Toyota cutting back on production.
