5,Rabbit on Rabbit - Pure Adrenaline,Watson Martin ,02/18/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,5,4,,,"Go Rabbit go has been going for now decades. With its generational shift to mature adults who once X owned 80s Rabbits. Unfortunately, the unibody pick was not crossed over. More about that later. I live in Roanoke VA driving mostly along interstates or the valleys jurisdictional byways with plenty of ups downs and curves of all sorts. Car handles like a charm even more so on passes crossing dozens of ridge lines located along the Blue Ridge Mountains to the east and the Appalachia Mountains to the west. It's tight and krpt me out of the ditch approaching a downhill car - both balls to the wall - with dry leaves in tow. Fortunately I road the rail on the right edge of a steep unguarded cliff. Adrenalin should be this cars middle name. Love it but got to sale it cuz of growing family and desire for tech audio smart upgrades. Dodge Durango SX. Go figure. Taurague is not my deal as it's much smaller for much more. American German dodge. Go figure.",,

3.875,VW could have done better,Hudi ,10/23/2010,,,4,4,5,5,,3,3,4,3,"The exterior of this car is quite nice, following the the line of the Golf. The interior is very well designed and finished much better than other cars in the class. The car is much roomier than it seems, the legroom and headroom in the back is great. The seats are poorly designed without proper lumber support that's why I'm rating it low.  The ride is very nice, the suspension is just right. Thanks to the multilink suspension in the back, the car corners like no others. The engine is the biggest flaw of this car, it's not powerful enough but the gas millage is not that great. I wonder why they didn't install a better European engine with similar power but better fuel millage. ","nice look, very nice suspension and handling. Interior design is top of the class","VW should either install a more powerful or economical engine, the current one is a bad blend.  The stereo system is pretty bad as well."

I sat in the back seat and could easily move around and had leg room! The car is super fun to drive on the highway and great for weaving in and out of traffic. The ride is so smooth and SO quiet, i couldn't believe it. The pick up is great too, very powerful little car. I feel like I am driving around in a nightclub when I got some good music going on.",Everything.,"I guess MPG, but its a huge improvement from my older 2001 jetta.

2.25,Not suitable for short passengers,candle27 ,02/01/2010,,,1,3,5,1,,4,1,1,2,"I am 5'3 and too short to reach the headrest even in its lowest position. According to the User's Manual and a phone call to VW America's head office, a cushion must never be placed on the passenger seat as this interferes with the airbag system's proper functioning. This only becomes clear after the car has been purchased one has read the manual.Therefore I am at risk in case of an accident and VW says that neither they nor I can do anything about it.  ",,
5,Just about perfect!,Eric ,09/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,In my family we own an 09 Rabbit and 08 Mazda 3. They are truly both fantastic cars. Both are equipped pretty much the same and they both cost the same (just about 17K). My wife drives the Mazda and she loves it however I am a good size guy and I find the Rabbit's seat goes back further and has more thigh support (and overall room). The Mazda gets better gas mileage but the Rabbit has better acceleration so in my opinion the lower MPG is a fair trade. Both handle extremely well and are a lot of fun to drive however the Rabbit is a little more quiet overall. The Mazda has one of the nicest stearing wheels I have ever seen on any car.,Very comfortable seats and driving position. Excellent automatic transmission. Excellent handling. Every car should have heated seats! Everyone should have a small hatchback. So versatile!,Center console should be finished better. MPG display like last years model. The seatbelts are really hard to reach on two door model. Stearing wheel controls (but the VW stearing wheel is also cool in a simple way).

4.875,"Run Rabbit, run!",Two5 ,06/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Car has seen all types of driving and has fared extremely well. The engine in the car is well suited to most driving situations and the abundance of power and torque plus an engine that enjoys revving provides an acceleration not found in competitors, the five speed manual has short throws and positive feel with good clutch feedback. Suspension is based on the sportier GTI, giving the Rabbit surefooted dynamics while providing a comfortable ride even over harsh roads, the standard ESP provides an added safety net. No problems while owning the vehicle, and fuel economy has averaged approximately 28 miles per gallon, while full tanks on the freeway can net up to 33 miles per gallon. ","Engine, transmission, suspension combination. Stereo system with 10 speakers. Standard ESP. Key fob can open or close windows. Sunroof. Blue and red gauge cluster lights.

4.75,I'm a believer!,Bossanova ,05/05/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"When it was time to trade in my old car (a '95), I looked at nearly all of the cars in the $15-20K market.  Drove the Mazda3, Vibe, Versa, Matrix, Civic, xD... they all kind of felt the same.  I had resigned myself to a functional compact with few features that I could ""make do"" with; then I drove the Rabbit.  WHOA - it was like finding religion. There is absolutely no car in this class that is nearly as fun to drive.  Plus even the base model is packed with extras.  The interior is refined with quality materials.  I got the 2-door 5-speed manual and I love it.  I've never owned a VW before, but the Rabbit has definitely made me a believer.","Solid build quality, great handling, peppy 2.5L engine, lots of room (I'm a big guy), red LEDs light the interior at night, easy-to-read gauges, hidden iPod dock, heated seats, adjustable center armrest, rear wiper, chilled glove compartment, defrost for side-view mirrors and back window","Make the 4-door available with a 5-speed manual transmission, provide a center armrest in the back seat on the 2-door, include a MPG dash display like in the 2008 models"
4.5,The Thunder Bunny Lives,conroypaw ,04/21/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"I purchased a 2009 VW Rabbit, after looking at other cars in its class, including the Mitsubish Lancer GTS, Mazda 3, and Subaru Impreza.  While I think I could have been happy with any of the other cars mentioned, I truly love my Rabbit.  I could not justify the additional price of the GTI for a few fractions of a second faster from 0-60 mph, and the added costs for premium fuel and insurance.  The Rabbit will satisfy all but the most power hungry.  Fuel economy is mediocre, but a fair trade off for power and performance.  The Rabbit has the best build quality, not just in intelligent design, but in the material used.  It does not feel like a sub $20,000 car, nor does it drive like one.","Perfectly sized steering wheel and fairly intuitive controls.  Excellent gear shift lever.  I love the way the gear selector ""snickity-snicks"" into place with precision with moderately short throws.  There's a lot of nice touches like the Gorilla Mat for the trunk, fasteners and the full sized spare!","While cool, the switchblade key / fob combo is big, bulky, and EXPENSIVE to replace.  Push button ""Start"" would be nice.  Make the 6-disc CD player MP3 capable option.  A center console storage / arm rest would be nice.  Replace the seatback adjustment knob with a lever for easier use.  Fog lamps?"

3.625,Re Knock Sensor issue,derblederb ,03/31/2009,,,4,4,3,2,,4,4,4,4,"I was looking for a little hatchback.  I picked the Rabbit over the Mazda 3 and Imprezza because it was more fun driving, cost less, and is supposed to get a little better mileage.  It also got great CR ratings.  I've had four people in it a few times and there seems to be enough room.  The car reminds me of the civic hatchbacks from the early 90s. ","It is pretty maneuverable and responsive like you expect from a little car, but it is really smooth on the highway.",I just had the same problem a couple other people here reported.  Just after turning over 600 miles the car started rev-limiting at 3000rpm.  Then a couple miles later the check-engine light came on.  The shop says the knock sensor needs to be replaced.  Not a good sign for a 1 month old car. 
4.75,Auotbahn Bunny,roymich ,03/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"This bunny is a fun and comfortable ride even at German autobahn speeds (+100mph). The bunny is just as roomy as my '03 Passat and easier to park in Europe's tight parking garages. I had one rough start on a chilly morning (+5F), maybe that Knock sensor acting up, don't know for sure because it cleared itself up in a few seconds. I was soaked getting in once by water pooled on the roof, run-off made it too my arm and leg before I could close the door. Need to be mindful of passenger side rear blind spot.  ",Heated seats! Fantastic headlights. Intermittent rear wiper. Tiptronic. Jumping Rabbit insignia.  ,"Make 1.4, 1.6, liter and turbo diesel engines for USA. ""Golf"" models for Euro drivers get twice the mpg!!

On 4 separate occasions though I have had the experience of putting my foot on the accelerator and got ZERO response. Fortunately, to date, this has only occurred from idle (ie car was stationary). Having read your review I will take it to the dealership again and ask them to check the Knock Sensor. Thanks",Good handling. Fun to drive. Heated seats. ,Ride can be a little rough.

4.625,Highly Recommended,KellyOConnor ,02/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"The Rabbit is a very enjoyable car to drive. I've put 8000+ miles on it so far and find it both comfortable and fun. The torque supplied in the low range is a great change from most newer cars that save the power to above 5000rpms. My wife and I fight over driving this car daily, rather than the SUV we have.","The loads of standard features (sat radio, seat warmers, etc) and the excellent engine.",The doors only lock externally with the remote or by putting the key in the lock; you can't hit the lock button when the door is open. Drives me nuts sometimes.  The traction control isn't as responsive on snow and ice compared to other small cars I've driven recently.
4.375,Knock Sensor issue,scoutandhuck ,02/05/2009,,,5,4,4,4,,4,5,4,5,"I just got my 2009 Rabbit 3 weeks ago and I mostly love it.  It has a cozy feel, the dash is easy to use, the lights are distinct and easy to read, and it handles nicely, even in snow (which we've had about every day since I got it).  It has a jaunty overall feel and I am quite pleased overall.  The sales staff was also really informed and helpful.","Heated seats are divine, a/c in glove box will likely be a favorite in summer.  I find the space ample and the seats comfortable.  I like the defrosting rear view mirrors.","My knock sensor went out yesterday, 3 weeks after purchase.  At 3k rpm I could push accelerator to the floor and get ZERO response.  They are replacing it, but it worries me.  Is this a problem for others and will it be resolved quickly? Wish it had better mileage."
4.625,I love my bunny!,Muddy Shores ,02/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"The best way to describe the Rabbit is: solid.  The steering and braking are nicely weighted; the doors and hatch make a nice ""thunk"" when closed; acceleration is smooth and strong.  Spacious for a compact car.","Acceleration, sunroof, Sirius (I was surprised how much I liked this), great feel when driving.

5,best thing i have ever bought,rabbitfan ,01/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I went from a 4 door Tacoma to the rabbit. Never again will I buy a truck. Fits my 6,3 self, wife, and newborn perfectly. Awesome display, speakers, ride is sooo quite and smooth. All these complaints on the mph, I have had no such issues. Nor have I had any issues with blind spots. A blast to drive slow or fast.

4.75,"High quality, nice features, and fun",Eric ,12/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I had a 2006 Rabbit for a short time (it was totaled in an accident), which influenced my decision to buy my 2009 Rabbit recently. The Rabbit feels like a solid, well-built car. It's a fun car to drive, with its 170 horsepower and the 6-speed Tiptronic transmission.  The controls are easy to use, and the layout is logical. The seats are comfortable, and the interior is roomy. I like the overall look of the Rabbit, inside and out. I like the features, too. The stereo sounds great and is easy to use. Standard Electronic Stability Program is a nice touch. The engine is smooth and seems quieter than my 2006 Rabbit. Fuel economy could be better. iPod operation is buggy and not intuitive.","Horsepower (170), 6-speed Tiptronic transmission, rear window wiper, sunroof, roomy & comfortable interior",Fuel economy could be better.  iPod operation doesn't always work too well and could use improvement - it would be nice if it showed song artists & names with the iPod and also let you navigate the music on your iPod the way the iPod does.
4,Rabbit Power,OnceHareless ,12/10/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Just went from an 07 Corolla to the 09 Rabbit. Couldn't be happier. Great performing and sounding engine, nice handling with perfect body roll, extremely solid feel on the highway, fun to drive, roomy, excellent safety features, decent (but not great) stereo, nice transmission, and generally good looks make it a winner. The Corolla is a good, but very pedestrian car. The Rabbit literally blows it away in the ""fun to drive"" category and comes with all the standard safety features that make the difference. ","Engine performance and sound, drive stability on highway, heated seats, turn signal, stability control, 4 wheel disc with ABS, interior sound level at speed, fun-factor.","Make the seat belt easier to grab when sitting (or turn off the seatbelt ninny monitor), bigger sideview mirrors, better stereo for 2 door, easier closing glove compartment.  more cupholders in the back.

5, Fun little car,Paul ,12/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love driving this car. I went from a pickup truck to the Rabbit. I didn't realize what a dog my truck was until driving the Rabbit every day. It's quick, shifts great, handles tight, fast lane changes are easy and smooth. I wanted a Mini Cooper S and the Rabbit gives me that sporty agile ride.    I would not trade hp for better mileage. The engine is Great.    Took a road trip on Thanksgiving and enjoyed the car. The cruise controls and audio controls were very intuitive and after a couple hundred miles I didn't miss them not being in the steering wheel. Its a very nice wheel so don't not buy the car just because the controls are not in it. You will forget about it quickly enough!","New to me the bump turn signal and you get 3 blinks, fabulous all cars should have it. The windows one click up & down is nice. Love the hatch opening handle, don't know why some dis it because it's one finger lift and it looks cool. Steering wheel is sweet. Vents under the seats are nice. 4whdiscb","More powerful amp for the 10 spks with std audio. Get rid of that plastic cover on the engine! That would pay for a larger amp.

5,IML8 IML8    2009,Pat ,11/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded in a 2001 Outback and was afraid the Rabbit would feel so much smaller-- it's not at all.  The mpg is better than the Outback, even with 1 more cylinder.  I was expecting entry level features and was surprised by the thought that was put into the design. I drive out to the mountains a lot and am pleasantly surprised at how my bunny scampers up a steep grade.  I had a Rabbit diesel in the 80s and am so glad I thought to try a Rabbit again.  I couldn't be more pleased.  ","This bunny hops!  The Rabbit is so much fun to drive.  I hadn't driven a stick shift in 11 years, but am having a ball driving this car.  Even though it's a small car, it feels big inside.  My golden retriever can sleep in the back without laying the back seat down. I LOVE this car.   ","The blind spot is annoying, but I'm getting used to it. The button to turn the cruise off is oddly placed, but it's not too bad.

4.5,Almost perfect,Schwe1nhund ,11/18/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,4,3,5,"Excellent car that handles extremely well on the road. Negotiates curves like a charm. I got this after wrecking my 07 Mazda 3 (through no fault of my own). The Mazda was a good car, but this one blows it out of the water. The Rabbit offers a smoother ride, a tighter turn radius, and generally a better grip on the road. Also, the Mazda is more expensive if you add all the features that is standard in the Rabbit. Its worth mentioning that because of this car's higher safety rating, my  insurance went down significantly. From the outside, the car looks simple, but in my opinion that simplicity gives it a more distinguished look. The laser welded body is a big plus. ",-German design and build quality. -170 horses - turn radius - handling - full spare tire - ample room in the front (I drive alone 85% of the time. Definitely not a family car). - Standard ESP - standard safety features (a big plus since I got into the aforementioned car wreck).,-Front center armrest should be a standard item...I like resting my right arm from time to time. -Audio bass is a little weak. -Glove compartment could use a few extra cubic inches. -Bigger side mirrors would be welcome -Terrible blind spot. -Unacceptable fuel economy for a car in this class.

Fuel mileage is a little bad but coming from 20/27 I'm good. There are little easter eggs in this car that a good run-through should show.  Stereo system could be improved, as it sounds like I'm listening through two old computer speakers, but who buys the base and expects premium sound? Radio reception and sound are much better than I expected.  The back seat is big enough to fit maybe one person comfortably, but don't through two adults back there.

The Rabbit does just that. You're not bulking around a huge vehicle, and so you are able to zip in and out of the rest of the traffic.
