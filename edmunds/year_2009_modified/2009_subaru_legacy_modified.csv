4.75,My First and Only Subaru,Kerensa ,02/24/2015,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I absolutely loved this car when I had it.  I owned it close to 3 years.  I needed an AWD vehicle, but I was hesitant to venture into the SUV world just yet.  Besides normal maintenance on the vehicle, I literally had no problems with it.  I just had to upgrade to something bigger so I was able to see out of it better.","AWD, Great Speakers, Highly Reliable","This is probably just because of me and the fact that this is a small vehicle, but I felt horribly cramped in it.  I just kept bumping into everything."

4,"My 1st SUBARU-""It's a keeper""-STILL!",hank60 ,07/08/2014,4,2,3,,,5,4,3,3,,,"This 2009 Legacy is a good value for what it is; I bought it used with about 20k miles on it---now it's 4 yrs later with over 75k miles. The AWD is great for the Ohio winters, especially once I replaced the OE tires with higher quality treads. I get about 25 mpg overall city/hwy which is not great, but for having AWD and the comfort and space for me, it's OK. I appreciate the rear seatbacks which fold forward, which gives extra space for storage, or transporting materials from Home Depot when doing weekend projects. I wish the engine had more power for quicker acceleration at times, but it's adequate most of the time. The car has been basically trouble-free...it's a KEEPER for me!   UPDATE: I have now had this car for over 6 years, and have put 100,000 miles on it since I got it. It still runs andhandles the same. Most of the maintenance has been performed by a local Subaru dealer, except brake jobs,which I felt they were just too expensive. The 4 speed automatic is very outdated, so the acceleration is slow. The newerLegacy with the CVT seem to be a lot quicker and quieter, which I will keep in mind, for some day. The newer models also have improved technology as far as sound systems, navigation, etc. I suppose I will be ready for a more updated model in a few years. This car seems like it will go another 100,000 miles without a doubt. It's still great for the Ohio winters.",,

4.125,Review from Desert Environment,iouae ,06/09/2014,,,3,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"bought my 2.5 B sport in 2009, now it has 120K miles on it, still feels as good as new. Super reliable, and as good as it runs in snow, so it does in the desert. Corners like a dream and the power is okay. depreciation is way lower than you would expect in this harsh environment in UAE. MPG is not that great, but who cares since Gas here is so cheap.The only cons here are the cheap sound system they send to this region, and the air noise insulation is poor, this gets annoying since most of the time we travel on highways in Dubai!

3.875,"Love the features, Not so much performance",mo77 ,10/31/2013,,,4,5,5,4,,3,3,4,3,"Owned this car 4 yrs. Up until the last few months of ownership, the car did well.At 90+ miles, it began to have issues.Interior features are superb. But performance is sub par.It rolls even with good tires. I suggest getting rid of the stock Yokohama tires.Acceleration is sluggish, probably due to the outdated 4 speed auto transmission.Manual auto shift great in snow. Inside, not roomy at all. Even center console was too small. I was fine at 5'2"", but my 6'2"" husband was not comfortable. Back seat is tight. Trunk room is good.AWD is its saving grace.","Harmon Kardon stereo (which I truly miss), Homelink, dimming rear view mirrors. Subaru remote start is a must in the Snow belt states.","I traded this car for the 2014 base model with the fog light package and paid extra for remote start.
The improvements were made with the new model years: better acceleration, more room. So much improved in performance that I don't miss the bells and whistles of the limited trim level."

3.875,Solid sedan,foggnm ,11/20/2012,,,4,4,4,4,,3,4,4,4," I sold a new 2012 Mazda3 which I never really fell in love with and purchased this car used with very low mileage as basic transportation. I drive about 5K per year. I wanted something I could transport my bikes and canoe on the roof. Nicely built sedan. Good handling. Not powerful at high speeds, but peppy at low and mid range. Decent trunk space that opens into back seats. Comfortable driver seat. After a 1000 miles of driving no issues, solid feel, and happy with my purchase. Mileage has been 24 city, 29 highway. ","All wheel drive. Overall driveability, maneuverability. Fold down rear seats. Trunk space. Sleeper image.
Much better reliability than my German car.","Power windows are a bit on the slow side, not sure if this is because they are frameless or just the motors. Needs a little better noise control over suspension. "

5,Very Happy First time Suby Owner,rjslemm ,08/09/2012,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Have had my 09 SE for about 3.5 months, and have loved every minute of it with 109K on her. Sheila had a minor blip with a blown tranny after a week, but I can almost attribute that to the previous owner. After a fight with the dealer it was fixed for free, with a loaner I hated(2012 Nissan Altima/CVT) Unfortunately Subaru no longer makes the 4 speed auto so I wound up with a 30K tranny, but she still runs and drives like a dream, fun to drive wet and dry, and am moving from PA to OKC before the next winter, so her snow will be limited, but I know she can handle it.","Competitive rarity, Harmon/Kardon sound with the subwoofer, moonroof, well, absolutely love the entire car. The seats are supportive in all the right places and comfortable on long drives, My 5-8 frame has no problem with a ""lack of thigh support"" some complain about.","Subaru needs to go to a modern 6-speed auto and leave the current CVT out of the equation, but thats irrelevant to the 09."

4.875,Excellent all around,jtanasse ,09/09/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I reviewed 2008 and 2009 Subaru Legacys for several months before purchasing one. I also looked at Honda Civics, Accords, Toyota Camrys and Carollas. I am a very careful buyer, so I was very cautious in my decision. Ultimately, the Legacy was the clear choice. Handling is great, and mileage is better than you would expect. I have gone on two 7-hour road trips and got 34.7 mpg on the first and 35 mpg on the second. Typically, it's around 33 mpg on the highway. This is just as good as the Accord and the Camry. Unlike the Accord and Camry, though, the Legacy has AWD all the time. This is great for winters here in eastern Washington state. I love my Subaru!","The design is beautiful in my opinion. I love that it gets great gas mileage even though it weighs two tons. And, of course, the AWD makes me pray for snow!","In 9 months of driving, I can't think of any improvements needed."

No, the car is not fast but it is fun to drive, corners like a dream and with the AWD is the best car I ever drove in snow, we get 27-28 mpg all the time in mixed use driving, the mileage got better as it broke in over the first 6 months.

4.875,Dang good car,imacarguy ,05/06/2011,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this car used with 20,000 miles and it was certified pre owned. I am accustomed to powerful cars, and this car isn't. That's ok, because there is more to a car than drag races. The power is adequate, but I think Subaru should tune the 4 pot to 200hp, then bump the 3.0 a little more. Very fun in corners, and the rain. Beware the stock Yokohama Advan tires. Crap, especially in the rain. Otherwise a great car. I like the looks of this generation more than the current, especially in sedan form.","Does well in the rain, but the tires quit too soon. Have taken the car through soft wet sand in the pouring rain at Folsom Lake. Very fun. Harmon Kardon stereo is more than adequate for factory stereo. Not the fastest car, but fun to drive. Looks good in satin white pearl with tinted windows, like mine. Also removed the badges, and it just has a clean look.","I average 22.5mpg in all city, and 30+ on just highway. I wish this model had the 5 speed auto on the naturally aspirated 4 pot; the 4 speed gets confused sometimes. Now the Legacy has the CVT, which I have driven for a few hundred miles, and it is ok. I have problems with the driver seat backrest creaking, and it has been to the dealer twice for it in 2 months, and still not fixed."

4.875,2009 Subaru Legacy Special Edition,edman01 ,04/24/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,Just bought this 2009 Subaru Legacy Special Edition with 8500 miles at a good price.I liked the new style but went with the older design.It is fun to drive....,"Love the options the special edition came with.
The car has plenty of pep and it will get up and go.... The main feature that made me buy the car was the color ""Satin Pearl White"".
It is simply a beautiful color with the design if the car.","Wish it had a little more leg room but I have no compaints about the car.
Fuel ecomony is something people compain about....I don't.
I have SUV's and pick up trucks and understand the value of the AWD system.
Moving all wheels will burn more fuel but safety for me and my family is more important than a couple of $$$ at the pump.
I will bet anyone those who complain about gas are happy when their Subaru is getting them home safely in a snow storm with little trouble."

4.75,Very happy three months in,lucasbear ,07/29/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I got this Subaru almost on a whim since I wanted to dump my lemon of a Chevrolet Impala. So far I have been very happy with the car. For a 2.5 engine it has plenty of pep to climb hills and the interior is extremely comfortable. The stereo system rocks,and the controls are easy to reach. A little noisier than I anticipated, but the car feels like it is riding on rails no matter what the weather. Fun to drive, safe, and well-built. I would be happier if it got better gas mileage but so far am averaging about 26 MPH in a mix of city and highway, and I will trade that for the ride and security. The trunk could be a little bit bigger for vacation, but otherwise I am extremely happy. ","Stereo system, road grip, exterior styling",Slightly larger trunk

4.625,fast family car,buggybear ,07/10/2010,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,3,5,"With the H6 engine, Bilstein dampers, upgraded audio and interior, and sporty AWD system, this car is a great drive for a utilitarian family sedan.  Trunk and seating space is adequate but not great.  Got it for about the same as the slab sided 4 cylinder 2010s hitting the lot -- great bargain except for poor mileage and some mechanical issues fixed under warranty.  Composed at speed, the car is good for curvy New England back roads too.  Auto trans is also OK with paddle shifters, but just OK (downshift blips are the best feature).  This isn't a true sport sedan but it's a nice compromise that allows a family of 3 to enjoy the open road (and allows a single driver to cut it up a little).","Drivetrain (engine and AWD system), Bilstein shocks, nice looking 18"" alloys, Harmon Kardon audio (not concert quality but fine for the road), stalk mounted flappy shifters (not on the wheel where up and down get lost in the corners), electroluminescent gauges, leather seats (great for long trips)","faster upshifts in manual mode, available manual transmission for naturally aspirated performance engines (Subarus in Japan and Europe have them), better traction control (acceleration on loose gravel caused problems leading to re-flash), rear AC vents"

I'm extremely happy with my decision and always look forward to driving it. It handles rain, snow, and freezing temperatures with aplomb.

4.625,Happy Buyer,axyooj ,12/24/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"The car can be a comfortable cruiser in I-drive mode or a powerful, sports sedan in Sport Sharp mode. There is a perfect setting for your driving mood or road condition. The GT Ltd. version is sporty and responsive; plenty of power is just one downshift away and pressing the accelerator. The turbo whirls into action and with the standard AWD gripping the road--wet or dry--the vehicle simply flies. Winter is now here and I have no reservations driving my kids around in any weather condition. Research your options, test drive the competition and then the Legacy GT Ltd. and the car you'll drive home is the Subaru.","AWD for nasty mid-west winters, HK sound system, comfortable leather-trimmed, heated seats, driver-controlled SI-Drive mode, turbo-power whenever needed, overall interior and exterior design (don't like the base models, but the GT Ltd. version with the functional hood scoop is mean and aggressive!).","Seat warmer switch is in an awkward location; manual shifter isn't very smooth, iPod interface is not standard, no storage for sunglasses, GT Ltd. version takes only premium fuel and while fuel economy isn't great, the safety and stability of AWD compensates in this area."

I wanted to wait on a review until I put it in the snow. It was amazing. Everything about this car with its value really added up to a great experience so far. The dealer was great about letting me test drive and had a great purchase incentive. They got me out of my Honda lease and into one of the last 09 Legacy on the lot. The premium sound system is amazing. The car drives extremely well and the interior design is great. I like the '10 exterior better, but am in love with my 09 so far.

Was used to the great mileage of a diesel but I drive a lot and being safe in the winter has its benefits as well.  The car runs me 29 mpg per tankful at 90% highway driving.  It is cemented to the road and I always feel in control.  It is agile and fun to drive although long distances my right leg seems to fall asleep.  The headlights have a horizon to them and is kind of funky going down a hill. I love the look of the inside and how the stereo is angled towards the driver as well as the placement of things, except the emergency brake and cup holders.

4.875,Glad we decided to test drive,Michael ,10/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My wife and I love our Subaru Limited. We have had it for 3 months and no buyers remorse here.  Handling - no comparison with other models in its class.  Steering and overall comfort is wonderful.  Test drove Altima, Accord and Sonata.  Though the others each had their perks and overall better gas mileage, the AWD and wonderful drive sold it for us. 3-4 MPG less was not an issue with so many other nice features.  The vehicle turns on a dime and handles great in the rain.  I can't wait to see how it handles under winter conditions. The HK sound system is great too but was not a reason to buy.  The car sold itself for us.","Road Handling, steering, interior design, body styling, HK stereo system and limited edition accessories.",5 or 6-speed auto transmission choices for better mileage (2010 model has improved on both of these); Darker Leather color choices; better driver armrest; HK CD player features - add random play to skip to different songs on different CDs.

4.75,Handles like no other,Tony Torres ,09/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This vehicle handles like no other.  This is the fourth ""new"" car I have owned, and it handles far better than any new car I have ever driven.  I traded in my clunker...96 chevy tahoe with a 5.7 litre V8, so the 4 cylinder took a bit of getting used to, but as I get accustomed to the power, it is pretty snappy.  Seats not too comfortable for long drives, but it's very easy and very fun to drive.  I took it up to the Colorado mountains twice and it climbs with ease and handles those curves, above the speed limit, without so much as a mild screech.  This vehicle is phenomenal, I love it, I recommend it to everyone.  The elderly may find it too low to the ground, so it is with most ""cars"".","Interior is gorgeous, mine is ivory (dangerous for stains) but contrasts with black carpet and metallic trim.  Handling is superior.","Gas mileage could be better, but understandable for for AWD.  Engine is loud on a cold start, I thought something was wrong with it.

It's not going to blow people away when the traffic lights change, but it's pretty nimble and responsive.  It's a fun car to drive.  The stereo is nice.  The handling is excellent.  It's quiet inside the cabin with very little wind or road noise.

I never owned a Subaru before so this was a new experience for me, once I got in it and test drove it there was no turning back. The car drives great, handles great, over all just a fun car. The HK audio system is incredible, those are the types of audio systems they put in much more expensive vehicles such as BMW. The only thing I don't like about this car is that it seems to pull to the right and the dealership told me that awd vehicles tend to do that. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this??",HK audio and really just about everything...I definitely would recommend a Subaru.,I agree with other people on here about the headlights do seem to have a sharp cut off maybe some HID's would be good.

It cruised through rain that had people pulling over because they could not see. We averaged 70 mph with the A/C on and the mileage was 31!  Great safety with the 6 airbags and traction control. I have been told it had a 5 star rating. Great HK stereo, very quick with the 5 speed. Steering is precise and the roadholding is fantastic.  I had two Audis and I like this more.  Plus, if it did have a maintenance problem (which I don't think it will) it would be cheap to fix.  A lot of car for 19K.",I really like 99% of it!,"I know it's nitpicky, but the Yokohama Advans are a summer tire. They have a great grip, but a very low treadwear rating.

It gets WAY better mileage than the FJ, which required premium gas. I took advantage of the smokin' $199/month lease that Subaru was offering, but I had never had one before. Needless to say, I was a little skeptical of just how good a Subie could possibly be, and I NEVER thought I would purchase one. All I knew was that they were equipped with all wheel drive, and there were many of them in Colorado. After my first test drive, I was sold! This car is every bit as good, and in most cases better than all the Toyota and Honda sedans I've owned. Better looks, handling, traction, interior, and comfort. ","Mileage - I've been getting about 23 city and 31 highway. Looks- sleek and timeless looks that won't get old anytime soon (I think it looks better than the 2010 model)! Interior instrument panel, gauges, and seat comfort - I'm a sucker for cool-looking red and blue lighting scheme. The stereo ROCKS!","Maybe the 4-speed automatic. However, if you put it in Sport shift mode, it makes a big difference. It's much quicker to downshift, and it holds the gears longer. You can either let the sport-mode shift for you, or manually shift it yourself. Very cool. A little small, but perfect for 4."

At the end of a long day there is nothing like my commute home in it (1/2 hour, city and country driving) to make me forget my day. Better still the fuel mileage is way better than I was expecting (about 29 MPG mixed driving conditions). The seats are really comfortable and the stereo is pretty awesome too. Even though the interior is a little smaller than comparable models, it fits around you giving you a nice blend of sport and luxury. Now I can't wait for wintertime driving and its AWD / traction control. Our other Subaru is 14 years old and we still love it.","Smooth ride and shifting, plenty of power for this size car, well laid out instrument panel, comfortable seats, nice sound system, and really good gas mileage for an AWD vehicle. I like the front end and wheel styling as it gives a sporty appearance. The variable power steering is also great.",The 2010 will be quite a bit bigger inside which is nice for passengers as the interior is a little small in 2009.

I love that you don't see many Legacys on the road. It makes them somewhat unique. The AWD, 18"" rims, Bilstein shocks, paddle shifters, and SI Drive make it a performance sedan.

Nice sound system from the Harmon Karden stereo.

To say the least, they have all been great cars. Zero problems with any of them. Between the 3, I've put over 200,000 miles on these cars-- not too bad. The AWD works great in wet weather. This is a very safe, very stable car. I wish the base engine had a little more spunk and wish the ipod input was on the dash instead of in the console. Other than that, buy one, change the oil every 7,500 miles and drive, drive, drive... Oh, and the gas mileage is great. I average 30+ MPG on the interstate with the cruise set between 75-78.

The car is a rocket, smooth as silk on the road, and is loaded with enough features to keep me busy for the next 6 months figuring them all out.  Nav works well, although sometimes takes an odd turn or two.  The car is a beauty, and accelerates better than any I have ever driven (and I test drive frequently as I am a car lover).  This is a driver's car in every way, and Subaru deserves more street cred after making a machine like this one!  I truly look forward to driving.",Interior is stylish and cool.

I live in the mountains in NC - and thought that AWD would be a good idea. I bought a 2009 Legacy (2.5 Special Edition issue). Although the ""pick up"" isn't quite like my Jetta - everything else more than surpasses my expectations and desires. My favorite part is the stability - in rain (no ice yet, but am waiting for winter), the car handles hazardous road conditions like a magnet on steel. I was amazed. I also love the stereo system - especially since I can plug in my iPod. Now I can listen to Stephanie Miller podcasts on my way to work. I love my Subaru! ","My favorite part - the handling. It's better than my Jetta and I don't have to put 19"" tires on my car anymore!! I love it. Also - I'm like a lot of other folks ~ I get 34 mpg on the highway - which is mostly where I do my driving. Amazing.","The only thing I would suggest is for the car to have more get-up-and-go. (I guess the Jetta spoiled me - but the Subaru excels in reliability, so I can handle the slower accelerating vehicle.) At least it doesn't break down on me monthly like the Jetta did."

The 2009 has stability control standard. Feels pretty sporty around the curves.  The AWD helps.  The base engine has more than enough power for my driving habits.  If you need more, get the turbo or 6 cylinder.  The interior layout is great; very logical and oriented toward the driver.  For a ""family car"" it's a fun car to drive.  It's a little small compared to other midsized sedans, but is comfortable for average sized adults.",The Harman Kardon stereo was a very nice touch.  It sounds magnificent!  The handling is nice and tight.  Clean and logical cockpit layout.  You don't see a ton of them on the road; which makes it a little unique.,"Gas mileage is not great, but for the AWD it's a decent trade off.

After 20 years of driving a stick shift I cannot immediately adjust from one to another. The stick shift is the way to go and still one needs to work the gears a little more on the Legacy. Sound isolation is better. On a recent trip I got 35 mpg highway at 65 mph with a loaded car with 3 adults and luggage and 33 mpg measured at the pump at 75 mpg. City is 23 - 25 mpg.

It has all the features that I need, plus a moon roof that I did not really need (standard on 3.0R). All that for around $25k price tag was acceptable. I don't make much use of  SI drive. I leave it on Sport mode, and take it easy on the throttle instead of making the computer do it for me. That way, I get fuel economy and throttle response also when needed. The MPG gauge does not show much of a difference unless I use low gear acceleration with Sport mode. Score of 6 for fuel economy is fair. Any worse then 17 city and 24 highway then I would not have considered this car, and the estimate seems accurate.","AWD. Not just because it's AWD, but also how it works. It behaves closer to a RWD. It sends more torque to the rear wheel from what I've read, and it feels like it. The HK speakers sound good, and the cabin is quiet enough to enjoy music, even at highway speed. V6 engine is quiet enough. Valet key. ","The most significant thing that I don't like about this car is the not so smooth 1st to 2nd, and 2nd to 3rd auto gear shifting. From 3rd and higher, it's acceptably smooth. Having a foot rest is great, but it's not wide enough, and there's a hump on the upper left corner. I don't like DRL."

4.875,this car is amazing!,hyadude ,09/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Traded in my '05 mdx for the Subaru. I must say its fantastic!  What a car! Performance is outstanding. The ride is super smooth, and the handling is fantastic. I really can't say anything bad about Subaru. This is the best sedan by far I have ever owned!","AWD, nav, SI drive, Harmon Kardon audio system, 6 speed manual",More storage space!

5,Legacy Keeps Getting Better,LegacyFan ,08/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my 4th Legacy, and by far the best one yet. The new Harmon Kardon stereo upgrade rocks, and the car is so much value for the money! It feels solid and tight in any conditions, handles amazingly (the test drive will make you buy this car!) and when you look at the sticker price compared to similar European makes costing much more, it makes you feel smart and lucky. Wish it had Bluetooth, love the new music and cruise control buttons on the wheel, would like more ambient lighting inside (which the Germans do to great effect). Elegant but not fussy, this car is comfortable, fun, sporty and luxurious all at the same time. Simplicity of design still works and defines a nice car.","Nice leather, nice stereo,high quality performance tires, moonroof and most of all the Subaru S-AWD feeling of surefooted control.","Add Bluetooth, add coin holder/drawer for tolls/meter change, add more sophisticated ambient interior lighting."

5,This is the car you've been waiting for.,Matt ,08/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"An excellent, smooth ride.  Stable, very little body roll even when accelerating into turns. Instrument panel and console layout well done. Smooth acceleration, smooth stops. Originally considered SE but the Limited boasts a lot of features that more than justify the increase in cost, though both trims drive exactly the same. Seats are comfortable, power seats & telescoping/tilt wheel easy to find your sweet spot in the driver's seat. The 2.5 4-cylinder is more than enough power.  If you are considering a mid-size sedan, the safety features of this Subaru more than make up for the sacrifice of a few MPG with a FWD/RWD car. ","Automatic transmission with Sportshift (Tiptronic), Heated mirrors & front windshield, all wheel drive, beautiful instrument cluster & console configuration, alloy rims standard, dual zone climate control.","A 5-speed automatic transmission would have been a nice finishing touch. Fuel economy is slightly below average for a sedan (but this is the trade-off with an AWD vehicle).  Color options are somewhat limited compared to competitors. Key fob with remote built in is somewhat clumsy, learning curve."
