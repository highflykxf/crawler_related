3,"1,000 of people with engine failure",Tom Williams ,01/19/2016,2,3,4,,,1,4,3,4,,,"I bought this car with 27,000 miles. at around 70,000 miles CEL for misfire in cylinder 4. I couldn't diagnose the problem with hours of testing, part swaps, and research. within 5,000 miles engine blew. The camshaft seals walked themselves out of the block and it dumped all it's oil and blew almost instantly. Called SoA and they claimed that their engine did have a problem with this but because I can't prove I ever changed my oil they wouldn't help me. I, like many other people in this world change my own oil. Never thought about saving receipts, but every 5,000 miles I put mobile 1 full synthetic in.  Customer support was terrible, and the dealership actually damaged my car when they diagnosed it. I left it with a cracked bumper and got it back with scratches on the driver side doors, and the bumper was ripped off and laying on the ground. I have never been so disgusted with an automotive manufacturer or a dealership. If you have one of these be sure to document oil changes and get a warranty for it or walk away.",,

1,Great vehicle but very poor longevity,Randy Buss ,08/03/2015,3,2,3,,,2,5,3,4,,,"I reviewed this vehicle when I purchased it brand new and gave it super good ratings in ignorance.  Though overall, it is a good vehicle, however, I didn't get longevity from it.On Friday (7-31-15) my vehicles engine blew without reason.  Two weeks prior, I checked the fluids (oil in particular) and all levels were good, but on the way home from work on Friday I suddenly felt and heard loud clanking sounds along with a drop in acceleration power going up a hill on the highway.  I was fortunate to be right at a rest area exit when this occurred so as to immediately turn into it, to which I coasted into a parking spot because the engine stalled just as I entered the rest area.  When I checked the oil, the dip stick was completely dry.  The engine didn't seize up, so I had my wife deliver me more synthetic oil and a new filter.  After draining the previous oil out into a pan at the rest stop (which was full of metal flakes/glitter and didn't give me good confidence for a positive outcome), I changed the filter and put new 100% synthetic oil (which I always use) into the engine in the hopes no major damage occurred, but when started it, it was clearly not runnable.  When the tow truck arrived, the towing mechanic started it and turned it off immediately and said it sounds like something was ready to fly apart.  The next day they informed me the engine is blown and needs to be replaced with a rebuilt or new engine.  Estimated cost: $4,500 to $5,000 to replace the blown engine with a rebuilt engine.What upsets me and disturbs me the most about this is I took meticulous care of the vehicle, as I do with all of our vehicles.  Furthermore, when the engine blew (started making horrible loud clanking sounds) no warning lights lit up on the display until the engine stopped running.  No low oil pressure lights, no low oil level lights, no check engine lights, nothing!  And how is it that it burned through three of the four quarts of the oil withing a two week span.When this occurred the car only had 120,000 miles on it, and was only 7-8 years old.  Granted, I haven't had any issues with it until now, but I also hadn't planned on having to fork out $4000-$5000 for a rebuilt engine, or purchase a new vehicle for at least another 10 years.  All of the vehicles I've owned (Pontiac, Mercury, Dodge, Nissan) I've used for at least 15 years each and well into the 250,000 mile range, and I've never had any major problems with them.With the research I've done since this incident, I've discovered a class action law suite against Subaru for an issue with their engines that strongly resembles what may have happened with my Subaru engine, to which the prosecuting attorneys disclose facts that Subaru has known about the issue, Subaru has neither disclosed information about the engine issue to their customers or done anything to correct the issue.  Instead, they continued to sell cars with a serious known issue which could be life threatening under certain circumstances.  Prior to this incident, I planned on making this car last me another 10 years, at which time I would purchase only one more vehicle prior to retiring.  My mind was made up it was going to be a  Subaru vehicle because I loved it.  However, as a result of this incident and the class action law suite against Subaru I've discovered, it pains me to say my confidence in Subaru has completely blown up with my Subaru engine, and I will NEVER purchase another Subaru.",,

It's great on gas, controls are extremely convenient, its fast. The only reason I gave this car a 9 for interior design are two reasons. I dislike the color of the seats because they are too light for my taste. I wear jeans a lot. none are new and my seats have a blue tint from getting in and out. The other reason is the the stereo area has worn a little above the AUX button... not sure why, but it seems the rubber coating is peeling a bit. I love that you can put it to manual when it snows.

It is fun to drive and I enjoy leaving other more expensive sports cars behind me when they sneak up on me in the fast lane.

Can fit a wheelchair in the back with the seats down and my 99-year-old grandmother can get in and out without problems (most cars are too low). Roomy interior. The interior is nice for the price. Visibility great. Stereo is fine. Hatchback makes loading vehicle very easy. It does dog if you're using the AC, but it seems sturdy and reliable. After a year of mostly in-town driving I love it.

AWD is a must, not only for winter, but makes a big difference in wet conditions. Reliability rock solid and outstanding resale value (previous Subaru owner). Apart from some complains by others, I like the suspension, just enough sport for this 46 year old guy and it soaks up bad pavement very well. Test drove a Civic and Mazda 3 and Illinois roads really did not like those 2 cars.

I enjoy the Impreza better than any for several reasons.  Manual transmission is fun.  Just under optimal power at 170 hp (basic model) but more than enough for 95% of needs.  Can drive it anywhere, anytime, any weather virtually without worry (like a mountain goat).  Better than rated milage (avg 27 mpg).  Very practical for dragging around stuff for kids at college.  Highly rated safety pick.  The BMW is twice the price and not as much fun to drive.  Will probably buy another in the future when needed.  Luv it.  ","Practicality, agility, driving ability in poor weather, AWD",Interior material could be a little nicer.  Offer a slightly more powerful (more than 170 hp but less than WRX) with manual transmission.  Perhaps 200 hp like the Honda Si would be optimal balance.

Considered another Outback but went with the Outback Sport. The fuel economy is not what I expected, the automatic shifts later than when I think it should (possibly contributing to the fuel economy issue), and the manual driver's seat gradually sinks down. I filled up the gas tank on Saturday, drove approximately 30 miles in-town, and I'm down below 3/4 of a tank. That's similar to what I was seeing with my 2001 Chevy Blazer. Also, snow gets packed up behind the wheels - when I try to kick it off, the splash guards look like they're about to come off.","AWD, cold weather package, steering wheel-mounted controls.","Driver's seat should stay where it is set, higher and more forward center console (even with the extender it could be more comfortable), better snow removal or clearance behind the wheels, crisper shifting."

I traded in my Outback for an 09 WRX 4dr when my pup passed away this year for a sportier vehicle; the WRX is an absolute blast to drive, I added the SPT dual exhaust, short throw shifter, and COBB access port and downpipe.  I opted not going with the STI because this car is a commuter and I wanted a smoother ride; also really liked the window and mirror heaters on my Outback and they were not available on the STI.  Handling is great and the 0-60 is unbeatable for a car in this price range.","Horsepower, AWD, Subaru name and engineering.  I like the feature that holds the brake with the clutch depressed while waiting for a light or on a hill.","The Sat/Nav option I would not do again.  This option is nowhere near the value you would expect given the cost.

It's extremely safe, capable, and fun-to-drive. To enhance performance I added a Cobb downpipe, a (second-hand) SPT exhaust, and a ""street"" ECU tune from a local Subie tuning guru.  I also added slightly thicker sway bars & replaced a few suspension & chassis bushings for a tauter ride (I suggest Whiteline products - they're top-notch). Now the car is nearing it's performance potential, but it still delivers a very comfortable ride on Oklahoma's junky roads.

I drive pretty conservatively and have averaged 28 mpg in 11,100 miles. While the tactile quality of the interior may not match that of my VW, the overall design and ergonomics are very good. The Subaru dealership experience that I've had so far, for oil changes, has been very good.

After only six months it had literally dozens of large 1/4"" paint chips on the hood and roof, and every time I looked there seemed to be more.  Fortunately, Subaru is backing up their product, and it is going in for a new paint job on the hood and roof tomorrow.

I'm still getting used to the different (read: better) handling of the AWD. I test drove roughly similar vehicles (Honda Fit and VW Rabbit) and this Subaru, while more expensive, just felt much more intuitive and well thought-out. The seat warmers are nice and standard on this trim. The fuel economy is better than expected (26-27 mpg city+highway), even this early in the car's lifetime.","Two trip odometers. All the thoughtful standard features on this trim (tonneau cover, rear rubber mat). Excellent build quality. Red dash lights. Grippy AWD that never lets go: I always feel in control of the vehicle. ","Whistling from roof racks is occasionally distracting. Better interface with iPod on dash (especially have the track dial work for more than tracks). Even though this is the raised trim, Outback-like clearance would be nice. Maybe *slightly* underpowered? Unusual bass response in stereo sometimes."

Went into the dealership one day for regular maintenance and walked out with my '09 WRX. The salesman didn't have to work too hard. This is by far loads better than my '05 and that one was very fun to drive. For the price this car has it all. I've got almost 4k on it and not one bad thing I can say.  MPG is the same if not better than my '05 that was smaller displacement and less power. I've been averaging 23mpg combined city/highway, with a heavy foot at times, and around 29-30 highway. If you are even thinking about getting one you will not be disappointed. You can't go wrong.    ","For sure the power. VDC gives even more traction in snow. Interior is very comfortable, and for prior subie owners very familiar. Did I mention power. Very good mpg even with a heavy foot. Its nice not to have to downshift on the freeway to pass someone, power is instant even in 5th at low RPM.","6-speed just because, HID's. Cant really think of much else.

Comparing the '09 Impreza to other cars in its class (Ford Focus, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Mazda 3, etc) there really isn't any competition at all.  The symmetrical AWD, power, smoothness of the ride... none of the others even come close to an Impreza. And the Impreza was much less expensive too!  It was a no-brainer and I couldn't be happier with the car.","Symmetrical AWD which gives amazing handling for both sport and bad weather, ride quality, sleek exterior, comfort, mini-blue light to light up the mini-tray below the stereo at night (without being so bright that it's distracting), mileage.  ","You have to hit the unlock button on the keyless remote twice to unlock all the doors (1st time hitting it unlocks only the driver door, 2nd time unlocks the remaining 3 doors).

I'm a automotive buff.  I love to drive cars. I've driven many cars but this might just take the cake.  I will admit, there are better looking cars that handle and perform as good as this but... the cost about 10000 more.  Not bad for its price. I can easily imagine keeping this car around for a min. of 7 years. Very pleased with the car. Comfort is nice.  I sometimes drive 250 plus miles at a time and never think once that my legs or back is getting sore. Mpg average on ten tanks 22.4.

Fast forward 7 years, and my patience was rewarded with the 09 wagon. Overall, I've enjoyed it after a month of mostly 100 mile daily commutes. People seem interested in mileage.  On Trip A and B the car has a fuel mileage calculator.  I reset trip A at each fill up.  Yesterday, was the usual $30 donation to the gas gods.  Determined, I wanted to see what extremely mild driving could do for this car's mileage.  On the drive in this morning, I averaged 29.7 mpg.  Not bad for average speed of maybe 60 to 65 MPH in stop and roll traffic.  Not a prius, but not a gas guzzler either.  Power is just tap of the pedal.",POWER!  Cabin is nice. AWD.

GT was a nerfed version of WRX, and if I am ready for an WRX I'd go STI anyway. Overall I really liked VDC; it gave the already phenomenal AWD feel an extra polish and ctrl. But it will be tough for your brakes as it will brake harder than you'd intend to, road noise is also slightly more noticeable than top compacts I tested.","performance: VDC+AWD, raised susp., comfort: adj. driver seat (up/dwn), seat warmer, cup holders, easy to maintain seat fabric. cargo tray, aux jack.",Pronounced road noise: more sound proofing for interior or at least wheel wells. More stiffening of the shock pistons would help road response. Add sub-woofer as a standard not as option.

The Impreza 2.5i is fun to drive, responsive, sporty, and economical.  I live in the midwest, where we get our fair share of ice and snow.  I have owned my Subaru for 5 days now, and can safely go places I never could go before in my Lexus.  For a base model, it has a great build quality, there are plenty of features, it is much quieter on the road than the Ford Focus, Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic, and when you factor in the AWD it becomes a no brainer.","The symmetrical AWD is out of this world.  The car is extremely responsive, and safe.  I love the average miles per gallon gauge that is based on your tripometer.  Great gas mileage, comfortable and well appointed interior.

The fuel economy could be better but it was a trade-off to AWD. What caught the eye first is the interior finished with better grade plastic, and chrome accents, leather wrapping are a nice capping. Fuel economy is ranged between 20-26 mpg pending on your driving style (go easy on that pedal and use some hyper-miling techniques). Interestingly the car looked like a lowered suspension version of Lexus 400h with Corolla-esque lights. I struggled between premium and sport, finally decided 17"" + taller susp. > sunroof.

I've owned most everything performance wise, Vettes (2), BMW, Porsche, Audi's (3), Mercedes (4), Lexus. This is my 63rd car and it is a real winner for a fraction of what I've paid for some other iron.

I considered the MS3 and even the Cobalt SS but FWD on those was a major drawback. Plus the Cobalt looks like a Cobalt. The 08/09 MY Impreza wagons are the first Imprezas I've cared for stylistically (the rear of the sedan version is hideous IMO).  I just broke the 1k mark but I've opened it up a few times already and man, the power is a huge improvement over my Acura. Averaged 25.5 mpg in single digit temps on a recent road trip too.

It is safe, reliable, and fun to drive, especially with the 5-speed manual. It handles great in the snow and off-road and is great to take on trips. I have not had one problem and am very satisfied with just about everything. I drive the car roughly 100 miles city and 320 miles highway on an average tank of gas and get close to 28-29 MPG every time (with an average highway speed of 75 MPH). The car does not have the power or the luxury of my previous one (a BMW) but is an awesome point A to point B car. Subaru should adjust gear ratios from 4th to 5th gear as the car seems sluggish when entering 5th gear.","AWD, exterior and interior styling, cargo capacity, smoothness of the ride, and the 5-speed. Reliability is also great. The engine is strong and the car is well built.",There is no oil or water temperature gauge on base models. Also interior plastics seem cheap. The headlights could be brighter... the RPMs seem to stick and not go down immediately when taking the car out of gear and shifting. Hopefully Subaru can fix that if enough people request it.

I highly recommend this car if you're even considering it. Nothing else out there equals it in its class.  Pictures don't do it justice. It's a must see and must drive.

In the 2009 Impreza Outback Wagon, the driver visibility is much better.  The seats are firmer and more comfortable, providing support where it's needed.  The controls are wonderfully placed so that you need not take your eyes off the road.  And to my surprise, the ride is smoother and more responsive.  I'm completely satisfaction beyond expectation.","Driver visibility, seat comfort, accessibility/placement of controls.
