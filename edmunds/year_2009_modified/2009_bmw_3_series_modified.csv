1,BMW 335D performance,Vi Co ,09/17/2016,,,5,,,1,,1,5,,,"directly after the expiry of manufacturer's warranty, the turbos failed. They fail unexpectedly so, if I am on the road, the car will suddenly lose turbo power, and, despite engine revs rising, nothing speeds the car over 40 mph. The car has spent more time and I have spent more money in repair shops than I spent on a smaller car I have as well, which runs flawlessly. I had believed that, after having spent a small fortune purchasing this car, I would not need extended warranty, but I was wrong! The help I received from Bavarian was no help at all. I was offered a $1000 discount on my next purchase of a Beamer!  I wanted to have some diagnosis, but all the diagnostics have been steadily repaired and the same problem recurs. I wonder if the car was made to run in cooler weather, as it runs hot and may have caused damage to the diagnostics in the computer, which is the more expensive one to replace",,

5,Ignore the Bad Bimmer Reviews - A Lot To Enjoy,D Needles ,03/15/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,4,,,"By the way, if you are going to buy the car, it's Bimmer.  The other spelling is for motorcycles.I've read the negative reviews.   High maintenance costs, rock hard RFTs, suspension issues, blah, blah.....Here's my story.Bought my 328xi black beauty with 34K for about half of the original cost.  Have now owned it for 2 yrs.  No major repair issues.   I have a local BMW (not dealership) do most of my maintenance well below the dealer prices.  I do the oil changes and plan to replace the front brakes next month.  Most of what I learned about how to work on my Bimmer I got off YouTube.  Trust me, you can do some of the basics or more if you care to.RFTs? I want them.  Won't see me changing a tire on the Interstate one late night.  And I had a flat with one, drove it 50 miles going 50 MPH to a Costco, no damage to the rim.  I replaced the OEMs with Bridgestone DriveGuard RFTs and they have been great.  Much better than the OEMs.  Got 25K miles on them and plenty of tread left.Suspension issues?  Yeah, it does on occasion ""boom"" when I hit a med sized pothole, but no damage to the car.  I figure you given up something for the superior handling and overall driving experience.  I see one coming, I go around it.  No problem.There is nothing like driving a well-cared for BMW, black-on-black, on a bright summer day.  It's artwork in motion.",,

4,Potential to be a really great car.,Joey L ,11/01/2015,3,4,4,,,3,5,5,5,,,"Make no mistake.   This is one of the best cars I have ever had, out of about 10.  I have a 335 with sports package, premium package and 20 inch wheels.  Jet black with dealer installed blueing of the chrome, and window tinting.   It is a fairly sharp looking car. On a good road, it handles and accelerates really well.  It is great for a driving trip with good roads.  The premium stereo is best sounding I have owned.  Even after 6 years the interior still smells like a new leather wallet (analogy upcoming).  Get this car on a well paved road, switch to sport mode and let it rip.  It is a very happy experience.  However, it is likely to cost you.  After i settle down from paying the bills I can joke about it.  But I think there is a computer chip somewhere inside the makes things start to fail after the service contract ends.  For example, on the first service visit after the contract ended, they advised spark plugs and wheel alignment.  That was $1600.  (of course this includes the World-class check up). After a big rainstorm the computer thought the engine was overheating and made the car slow down on the freeway to 25 MPH.  That was fun.  Be prepared for unsympathetic people when you drive a BMW.  After 3 service visits they figured out it was water leaking into the battery compartment and cabling conduit. That was $3400.  Tires?   $1700, every two years.  Gotta love them run-flats.  I figure the car smells like a wallet to remind you of how much money you will need to continue to put into it. Even with that, I really like this car.  I sort of expected it was going to cost a lot once the warranty was up.  But not quite that much. I think that If I do this again, I would lease and make sure the lease ends before the warranty does.  But then it would be hard to get the extras just right.  That is, the sports package really does ride better than the standard suspension (I really did try both) and the premium stereo is really good sounding (I did try both).",,

3,Major Issues,Disappointed ,09/23/2015,2,3,3,,,1,3,4,3,,,"Bought a 2009 328xi with certified warranty.  Under warranty the engine fan needing replacement, the rear light assembly and the air conditioning unit.  My warranty expired in March 2015.  It is now September 2015 and I took my car in for an oil change and front brakes and they are now telling me my front differential needs repaired and I have a cracked valve cover.  Mind you my car just turned 60k.These are all major repairs for a car that is basically 5 years old and very low miles.  I am so beside myself that 6 mos after the warranty I have more large ticket items at the tune of $3k. to repair?I will probably never buy another BMW as I have vehicles over 15 years old at home that have never had to have major work or major repair bills.  I took the car down to see what the trade in value is and its only $12k after paying $32k for it 5 years ago.  Wow!",,

4,Almost Perfect...,cheapdeep ,01/14/2015,,,3,5,4,3,,5,4,3,5,"Third BMW I've owned.  BMW got a lot right but they also got a lot wrong.  The engine, transmission, styling and handling are all incredible.  But everybody knows that.

The ergonomics and interior leave a lot to be desired.  BMW really lost the form follows function on this one. The cup holders are obvious but where do I put my sunglasses?  I don't have keyless start so what's the point of the start button? Instead of putting in a key and turning, I now have and extra unneeded step to start the car.  And iDrive?  Everything on there could be replaced by a $40 burner phone from Walmart.  It's pretty useless although it does look pretty.    ","Engine, transmission, power, drive, handling and styling are all spectacular!  I can't overstate this, the car is amazing to drive.  They got all the hard stuff perfect.  It's frustrating since the mistakes are all the easy things they should have down by now.","Ergonomics stink, interior design needs a lot of work.  Constant warning lights for everything.  Run flats are horrible! Seriously, what was BMW thinking?  We are going to take a perfect suspension and add the worst possible tires to it.  Bouncy, rough, loud.  The BMW dealer where I am isn't very good which is unfortunate since I'm at the dealer for something or another every few months like... the top hasn't stopped rattling since I bought it.  "

5,Ultimate Driving Machine - two years later,faljrgray ,12/03/2014,,,4,,,4,,5,4,,,"I have owned BMW since 1991, a 318is with a m42 motor that got me 355,000 miles (Still Running Strong). I now have a 2009 328i that is a perfect driving machine. Yes there will be some repairs but BMW is an icon not an interloper like Acura and Infinity that is still trying to copy the BMW, yes copy the BMW. The Germans conceive and build the automobile as the Japanese attempt to perfect the automobile for a cheaper price. I also own a Harley Davidson that is the real deal not like the interloper of all the metric bikes.The Japanese Motorcycle industry make motorcycles that look like a Harley but Harley copies no one nor does BMW. Do you want a interloper or the real deal for less...?Update...6/03/2016Two years later I'm totally satisfied with my 328i. I just replaced my set of Pirelli tires with a new set (90V).

No Japanese cars can match the comfort and performance.

4.375,No Car Is Perfect,theomdude ,03/20/2011,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"I traded a 330Ci with SMG for a leased 2009 328i Coupe with paddle shifted Steptronic. I loved my 330, and this car is close, but not quite there. The luxury details on my Premium/Sport Pkg. example, like the ambient lighting, is cool and material quality seems top notch. But the car seems ""fatter"" and the specs say it is, by 66 lbs. That doesn't account for the extra weight of the SMG in the 330, so it's probably close to a wash. The hp is up by 5 & torque is down 15 but the sense of slight softness in acceleration is probably the difference between a clutch and a torque converter. I've seen 130 on a short straight so I'm not complaining. At my modest skill level the turbo would be wasted.","The balance of the overall package remains difficult to beat. I like that they gave up the pretense of a five -seater, and gave the interior a GT look with the console extended into the rear compartment. While it's grown to match wheelbase with the old E-34 5-series, it's still compact enough to execute a U-turn on our residential street. Styling proportions are still spot-on, the handling and braking are better than my driving can exploit, while protecting me when my limitations become apparent. There are faster cars, cheaper cars, and more luxurious cars, but aside from a Mini or a Lotus, none that are more fun to drive. The articulated seats in the Sport Package are still among the best.","The same level of luxury in the old E-46 dimensions would have been nice, but that's a pipe dream. Ditto the return of a real dipstick. Giving the buyer the option of a real spare and non-run-flat tires would be useful. The 2006 330i had 255 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque, and that would have been nice to have. I know Germans abhor the idea of doing anything but driving when you're behind the wheel, but a cup holder that will keep a Vente Latte from scalding the passenger's lap at the first swerve would be a huge improvement for many Americans."

Now my car is very, very close to my idea of the perfect all-season daily driver.","Please do something about the dot matrix on the rear window - or simply offer an option for a factory installed rear window tint.

3.5,MORE COMPLEXITY,DL ,02/28/2010,,,2,5,3,4,,4,3,3,4,"Looks great, AWD with winter tires makes it unstoppable in snow. Standard seats not good for long trips. Recent 1200 mile trip in 09 accord=much more comfortable in a car costing 1/2 of my 3 series. This is my third BMW, all electronics get more complex and inscrutable with each new model: bluetooth phone not well thought out, and my ipod becomes more difficult to use with BMW controls. If you like making a hobby out of learning how to use a car, BMW controls may appeal to you. Minimal storage space in passenger compartment. Lots of unfixable noises in very cold weather.   On the plus side, great handling, nice ride (16 inch tires). Fold down rear seats very useful, esp with small trunk. ",All wheel drive. Brakes.,"  Fix inaccurate speedometer(3-4 % too fast) and (overly optimistic) mpg calculator.  This seems to be characteristic of all BMWs. Need more comfortable seats.

For me, it was the refinement and composure that won me over, but the gas mileage (25mpg so far) is a bonus. Worst aspect is the attention.

This is my first experience with a BMW and so far (first month) it has been very good. The xDrive system is quite good on ice and snow, but as other reviewers have commented,  a delay in acceleration can be felt. Fuel economy is around 16 to 18 mpg in town and 28 to 30 on the highway. It may be too early to comment on the run flat tires.",I will have to comment on this later,1. Cup holders (as many have suggested) 2. Availability of xDrive on the diesel models

4.875,Great looks with muscle to back it up,swiz454 ,02/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Blk/blk auto w/sport package. This car is fast. It pulls hard like a V8 and has a great engine note. Since my previous cars were manuals I was hesitant getting the auto but with the sport mode it holds the gear longer & you can run it to redline. I like this a lot mostly coming out of a turn - you're always in the right gear. The new iDrive is light years better than the previous version. The car is an excellent mix of daily driver & rocket. I catch myself doing 90+MPH on the hwy, feels like 50 mph. It has all the latest technology anyone could need (bluetooth w/phone import, GPS w/lrg scrn, itune integration).","4yr pay nothing warranty. Itunes integration! Every car should have it. Well worth the $400. New black anthracite window trim on spt package, new iDrive and GPS screen. Front end & rear back quarter view styling. Elegant yet mean looking at the same time.  ","Seat beat arms are odd, allow for rear windows to crack open like the older coupes did.  Make convenience option std do you don't need to put the key in to start. Many cheaper cars have this.I would agree that the run flats do ride a bit rough but feel the trade off is worth it if I ever do get a flat"

4.625,A big step up!,Matt ,02/08/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"Great car! Looks great. Drives great and is scary fast. Very smooth so you have to keep an eye on speed. Mileage is about as expected (21 mpg overall so far). Compared to Caddy CTS, Infiniti G37, Audi A4, Acura TL.  For driving feel and fun, BMW wins easily (G37 is closest). Had trouble with sun visor pulling out of headliner, which is now fixed. Also got a flat tire on way home from the dealership - run flats came in handy! The AWD seems to work well, but the tire grip in snow/slush/ice is not great.  Overall, and expensive purchase, but I have absolutely no regrets.","Engine, drive feel and performance are awesome! Heated seats and steering wheel (heat up VERY fast); folding side mirrors (nice in tight garage); overall, a great ride.","I haven't hooked up Bluetooth yet, but have been told to be careful to use approved phones only - however, the list of phones is short and outdated. Broken sun visor was frustrating."

The interior is way ahead of Infiniti and maybe even Audi. The car shifts sooo smoothly. Forget the G37, considering the deals that are available, it's time to buy the Bimmer!

4.5,Blast to drive!,buckeyedoc ,01/13/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,Have !2500 miles on this coupe and I love it. Top notch performance and styling.  The handling is great.  The mileage on the highway is OK (28 MPG) but not great around town (16MPG).  I have had 2 Audis before this and I think that the Audi is better in the snow and the interior is superior but the BMW is much more solid feeling on the highway.  Overall for me it is a toss-up.  the deciding factor was the proximity of the dealers (10 mins vs. 40). Only regret is that I wish I had gotten the manual.,"Powerful engine, heated steering wheel, Bluetooth.",Dump the run flats!

4.875,Follow-up review after 2K miles,Michael ,01/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Driving in about 4 inches of unpaved snow, slush and ice: In straight lines it accelerates and stops under complete control. To test out the traction around corners, I took a couple turns at relatively unsafe speeds, close to 15 MPH. The DTS flickered and appeared to do something, but it definitely felt like I drifted out of my lane.  During sensible speeds, drifting was not an issue. Slight hesitance may be confused with skidding, but its actually DTS doing its thing to keep you on your intended path. X-drive is very capable. However, I honestly feel Subaru sets the bar when it comes to AWD technology.  Basically if you're looking for a luxury AWD coupé, look no further. ","I really like how the windows slightly open/close when entry/exit from the vehicle, ensuring a snug window-frame to frame-of-car contact. Nice touch!  You can really get a feel for the quality of build just by closing the heavy trunk lid. Seriously. Open and close one.","RFTs are pretty loud, please make these an option. Standard security system!  BTW, the iDrive is a very unnecessary feature.. only get it if you drive automatic :)  The iPod integration works wonderfully by itself.  FYI, keep doors unlocked when fueling, else the fuel gun may kick prematurely"

4.375,"Good performer, questionable reliability",Jason ,01/02/2009,,,4,5,5,2,,5,5,4,5,"After test driving several makes and models, I bought the 335i xDrive with the sports package and nav.  The car has been in the shop for approximately 2 of the 6 weeks that I have owned the car... so far (issues with a coolant pump).  Car drives well on dry road but during our recent snow storm, the car had poor traction despite xDrive and the car slips and slides with the slightest braking.  Most likely due to the tires that come with the Sports package.  When I drove the 328xi loaner car, while my car was in the shop, it drove well in the snow.  Overall, a good looking sleek car with good performance and features.","Naturally, the most favorite feature is the performance.  Nav works great.  I read reviews about how horrible iDrive is but, I thought it is overall very user friendly.  Easy blue tooth hook up to the phone.",Get rid of the auto dimming feature for the rear and side view mirrors.  Improve climate control.  Cup holders are the worst I've seen (location and quality).

5,INCREDIBLE!,BMW Enthusiast ,12/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,It's about time that the U.S. gets the german performance diesels!  This car is absolutely a blast to drive and the 425ft lbs of torque is felt very easily in your seat.  The exhaust pipes are so clean it looks like one can eat off of them.   Anyone who test drives this car will not be disappointed.  Most simply put..this is an awesome car!,Power/torque,Would be nice if the price of diesel came down.  BMW.. Please ship the AWD and wagon with this engine!

5,From Audi to BMW,Devon ,12/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I recently purchased my BMW 335i xDrive and it is amazing.  I took the car with all options available, and so in terms of aesthetics, performance and functionality, this car is sublime.  I use to drive an Audi 2.0T Quattro, and though the cars are not meant to be compared, I can say without a doubt that the BMW ride quality, performance and driving experience are considerably superior.  The interior layout is also on par with Audi's high-quality interiors.  Overall, I must say that I'm happy I got this car over an A5... though I probably would have taken an S5, had there not been a 1yr waiting list! ","The updated iDrive system for 2009, which I think is only available on a few models, is great!  Everything is user-friendly and intuitive.  There aren't too many options, and the shortcut buttons are key.  Though I never played with the old iDrive, I'm very happy with this option!  A must on an BMW!","I wish I could have the DVD play movies as I am driving.  Though I understand this to be a security feature, passengers would love this option!  Also, I would reconsider the cup-holder configuration.  Sounds trivial, but actually very important!"

Said goodbye to my '06 330xi sedan, gave her a hug, and never looked back. My 330 was fast. But this coupe is stupid fast.  Always thought my 330 was smart and had ""a nice personality."" But the 335 coupe is hot!  Seriously considered the A5 Audi and VW CC. They're nice, very nice, but they are runner-ups. BMW needs to seriously ditch the run-flats.

4.875,1st time BMW Owner,Mike ,12/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"We purchase our 1st BMW in December 2008. We test drove Audi A4, Infiniti G35, Lexus ES 359, Cadillac CTS and chose the BMW. My wife and I like all the features of the BMW 2009 model wagon down to the handling, The iDrive is not that bad once you get use to it. We currently have 600 miles and plan several trips this holiday.    ",The Pros: Drives great and nice options. Fuel economy is great as long as you keep your foot out of it. For a man that's hard even with the 230 HP 6 cyl. If you need more speed you probably get more tickets.,Cons: Rear seat room and no storage. Darn can they even put lug nut covers on the car for the price. Run flat tires - get rid of them.

4.875,Breaking-in the new Bimmer,Michael ,12/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"First time owner of the BMW. Being from the Northeast, Ive only driven AWD vehicles. I was well aware of the certain stigma clouding the x-drives, BMW being predominantly RWD and all, as well as the CDV issue.  I can certainly put the CDV issue to rest. At first the minuscule delay will be noticeable, but after 200 or so miles of getting used-to, if you cant adjust the feather of your foot to compensate for the delay, any discomfort from passenger head-banging is all on you.  As for the AWD, havent had a chance to test it out yet this winter, but there is a difference between the xi and the 328i that I test drove in the dry, in how each gets off the line. The i is more responsive.","The cross-wheel drive system. However, after the 1st gear, the bark and bite of each were very similar in character. Around the corners is where youll notice more of a difference, as the 328xi was able to carry more controlled speed through than the RWD.",Make the security system standard on the 3-series! And maybe make the coupé sit a little lower. Theres way too much wheel to wheel-wall space. Larger glove compartment? Everything else is beautifully done.

4.625,"Not perfect, but very, very good!",JAD ,11/30/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Would have given it all 10s but couldn't because of the flimsy exterior mirrors, the bad cup holder design and, worst of all, the run flat tires. These have to go, and as soon as I have the time I will get rid of them and replace them with regular high performance tires. The RFTs make the ride rough and the cost of replacing them is ridiculous. These tires are my biggest drawback about the BMW. Fuel economy isn't as good as I'd like but I'm not complaining about that because the performance of the car is excellent. Test drove the C-class, but once I drove the BMW I knew right away that its a much better car. Too early to tell about reliability, but so far its looking like a keeper. ","This car is a real beauty, especially with metallic paint and 17"" wheels. People stare at it everywhere. Much roomier than it looks from the outside. Fits me perfectly. Tight handling. Feels rock solid on the road. Fast. Not as cheap looking inside as the C-class.","Didn't care for the iDrive. This needs to go. Not worth the $$$ IMO. If you need a nav get a Garmin. BMW should ditch the run flats and put back regular tires and a spare on this car. Cup holders are flimsy, cheap, and placed in a bad spot. Get rid of the vinyl and make leather standard."

5,Wow,JScott ,11/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The 2009 BMW 335i is even more fun than my previous 2006 BMW 330i.  I had a great experience with my previous 330i and didn't think there was much room for improvement.  The 2009 335i takes an already near perfect design and adds just a little more in a lot of area.  The engine is something you just have to experience by driving the car.  Great power at all speeds and seems to beg to be driven harder.  The handling is great in the curves.  The new iDrive is fantastic. This is not the sluggish iDrive system of the past.  If you are into tech toys and can operate a modern cell phone you will love the new iDrive.  If you like performance cars go test drive one.  Just be prepared to want one.,The new iDrive/nav is great.  Finally modern and easy to use.  No longer sluggish to respond.  Map look is very modern and intuitive.  Ability to split the display screen with 2 different maps.  The engine and handling - phenomenal.  Apple iPod Integration - easy to use and control.  ,Cup holders are ok but with a passenger in the car they are a bit awkward.  Run flat tires are expensive to replace and do not last as long as regular tires.  No option for non-run flat tires.  IPod cable is very short.

5,Awesome,Bob ,11/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I picked up my 2009 335i xDrive a week ago and this car is amazing.  I look forward to going to work in the morning to drive it.  It seems to eat up the road and the 18"" run flats with the sport package are unmatched.  The growl the car make when you turn it on and step on the gas is worth the price alone.  The stereo is incredible, iDrive is easy to use as well as the navigation.  I am so glad I stopped in the dealership on the way to check on my Audi A5 that was on order.  I drove this car and made the deal that night and drove down the street to cancel the Audi.  I have had Acuras, Infinitis and driven my dad's Cayman S; this car blows them away.  I will never buy anything but a BMW again.","iDrive and stereo, the iPod integration is great, you have all your music at your finger tips.  Also you can rip CDs into the cars hard drive, so no more carrying CDs with you. The smooth transmission through gears,  the car has a great sound.","Would like a little more storage for thing in the car, other than that nothing."

Fast, tight, great control, nice new body look with minor changes in the 09 in the exterior as well as on the interior.  iDrive is so much better then old system.  Great maps, options, usability, hard drive! And with the new twin Turbo which does its part to conserve gas this beast has power when you need it, and style when you are just rolling.   Perfect mix of luxury and sport.  The back seat is too small, but I guess thats why there is a 5 series.",Has to be the hard drive and the ability to rip discs in the car.
