5,Green Knight,John Wright ,11/20/2016,,,,,,,,4,5,,,Been a great car.  Found out displays and repair lights come on when the battery is very low.  Have battery tested/replaced before leaping into airbag replacement or some other very expensive repair items.  Honda dealerships as well as Chevrolet dealers can do all the normal servicing even though Saturn dealers no longer exist.,,

5,Better than our Honda,CJ ,09/25/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,4,4,,,"We bought this car in 2010 with relatively low miles to replace our 2004 Honda Civic coupe since we had a baby on the way.   The Aura was a real step up in size for us at the time as my wife and I were both used to driving compacts.  It was a steal for a one year old car since Saturn was on it's way out, but it's essentially the same as Malibu and therefore parts and service are cheap and easy to come by.  It's now approaching 8 years old and has a bit over 121k miles and we haven't really had to fix anything.  In fact, the only repair (aside from body damage from people running into it) has been a camshaft position sensor that cost us about $40 at Autozone.    The rear door locks don't always open by pushing the button on the door, and the plastic shroud over the radiator makes a little rattling sound when we first start it up, but aside from that, it's been pretty bulletproof as far as reliability is concerned.  The AC is still ice cold, it doesn't leak anything, and aside from the rear door lock, everything works fine.  The car feels as solid as my old Volvo 850.  Our Aura has the Ecotec 4-banger which won't win many races, but it's fine for what we use it for--our daily commutes.  If someone wanted a cheap, reliable car that still feels modern, I would strongly recommend.",,

4,Nice car,straydogger ,02/02/2015,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,I bought my 2009 in 2010 with 33000 miles. The only problems I've had are the trunk light has never worked for me. I've checked the bulb and fuses and no go. I've replaced the windshield wiper linkage twice. Not the motor..just the linkage. It's not a very good design I think. A metal ball in a plastic socket that is packed with grease. A rubber boot keeps the grease in but when it wears out it dries out and then the linkage falls off. Need to buy motor and linkage to really fix the problem. Driver's door speaker doesn't always work. Left rear door lock won't lock/unlock with the key fob. Small problems. All in all the car starts everyday and gets me where I want to go. That's what counts.,,

4.5,"Value wise, a much better choice than Malibu",golftango ,06/03/2013,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,5,4,"I purchased my Aura new in Nov 2009 just as Saturn was exiting the business.Therefore I got an amazing deal. Options are the Comfort and Convenience packages which include power seat, auto dimming rear and side view mirror with compass, Homelink, Power Sunroof and Bluetooth.To date I have put 53K miles on my Aura.The only issues I had were a bad strut and faulty seat frame.Still on my original brakes and second set of tires. It still looks new inside and out.Quality materials have held up well and the paint is nice as it's thick and durable. The Aura is one of the quietest vehicles I've driven.It eats up highway miles and I never get uncomfortable or fatigued.","I really love the USB radio.
With my iPhone, I can stream my music right through the stereo or use Pandora and the radio displays the Song Name/Artist.
I can also use the Google Map application and get turn by turn directions right through the speakers, no need for navigation.


I also appreciate the Aura's quiet ride and tall gearing.
The 2.4L barely hits 2K RPM @ 60MPH. 

The night illumination is a night touch with LEDs that shine a subtle ambient light on the center console and lighting behind the door handles.

","The amber illumination on the radio or cluster
cannot be read in direct sunlight.


With the use of hard plastics around the dash and console, I get occasional squeaks on rough pavement. 

The sunshade on the sunroof rattles.
If it's not all the way open or shut, it makes annoying sounds.
 Just a bad design.

The 6 speed automatic gets confused easily.
It shifts too quickly to get to a higher gear.
When you step on the gas to merge, it takes a few moments for the computer to react and downshift.
It has made for a couple of scary merging situations.
The transmission also does not shift smoothly in traffic situations when you're traveling less than 20-30MPH.

4.5,3 Years and Still Satisfied Actual 22 to 38 mpg.,alero02 ,03/12/2012,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"Our 2009 Saturn Aura XR 2.4L 6 speed now has 31,000 miles and we still love it. It still compares well with it's sleek exterior to newer models from Toyota, Honda, GM, Ford, Nissan and Kia.The interior is very up scale with leather seats and contrasting trim, plus there are luxury items you might expect only on pricier cars. From the 6 CD XM radio that plays regular CDs or mp3 with song titles and other info, to the dual front power seats the car is comfortable, sporty, and up scale. We also have had excellent follow up service from out local Chevrolet/Cadillac/Buick dealership for all regular maintenance and even a warranty replacement recently on the driver side door arm rest.","Sleek up scale exterior and interior. Great gas mileage at 22 to 24 (summer/winter) city and 33 to 38 actual mpg on longer highway trips. 2.4L has plenty of power even on the highway for passing. Not a hot rod, but no slouch either. Reliability has been great with no repairs other than maintenance in 31,000 miles and 3+ years. Daily driver for wife and also used for trips form Wisconsin to Florida, out East, and routine urban freeway to cities 70 to 80 miles away. Firestone FR710 tires are still good, but will probably replace this Fall for safe winter driving. (est. 39,000 miles then).","In winter when the tires and suspension is stiffer, road noise from cracks and bumps in the pavement is transmitted inside the cabin. I have found this to be true of most ""unibody"" frameless cars we've had from Toyota, Nissan, Izuzu, Subaru, other GM (Chevy Citation, Lumina and Ford Taurus) and some others. Only my 1993 Pontiac Bonneville was quiet with little or no ""road thump"" from tires. The Saturn Aura rides more quiet in Summer when tires and suspension are more pliable. "

Still has Road noise from the tires and the brakes were squeaking, but if I keep the air pressure at 34 it seems to be ok.  I get 24 mpg average!  Dealer sold car with 2 sets of tires instead of 4 matching which is probably why I get so much noise and weird tire rotation sounds.  I'll get new brakes and tires soon!

Great freeway cruiser, has almost identical dimensions to our Accord but 4 in longer wheelbase, which translates: smooth ride.

Paddle shifters are handy at times but rarely use. Is eager to shift to overdrive for max fuel economy. If you can drive the speed limit, you can get 34 mpg highway. Very quiet, feels like a heavy, solid car but gets sporty when you throw it around. Nicely laid out interior is elegant and comfortable. I'm 6-3 and have lots of room. So sad these are the last of a great model.","Base model is loaded. 4 wheel disc brakes are strong and smooth. Beautiful,not trendy exterior styling. Satellite radio;I love the old time radio shows. Nice to have a USA made car. Comfortable for long trips. Wheels look like alloys without the maintenance. Instrument cluster well designed and lit.",Do not care for daytime running lights.

I have driven several 6sp/4cyl combo's and the GM one is by far the best out there in shifting, power and mpg so I am not sure I would trust those other remarks on here.

I had to have it towed twice.  The dealership returned it to me and assured me there was nothing wrong, despite the fact that I pulled out in front of traffic and could not accelerate.  I was told to ""...pull off to the side of the road, shut off the engine, then restart the car to 'reset' it.""  After this occurred the third time, I did as instructed, then drove it to the dealership, and left it there.  I insisted it was dangerous, and I was now following the GA Lemon Law.

So far I am happy with the Auras performance. Ok its not a Lincoln, but the drive is comfortable and the 2.4 four cylinder gives me enough power and speed thanks to the 6 speed tranny.

I looked on the blog to see what others thought and the very first review I read summed it up - the transmission ""hunts"" and it is ""jerky"".

Also agree that steering wheel control buttons are too small and hard to use.  I would add an item that was not in other reviews. The aerodynamics seem flawed; when travelling at 50 mph or faster, and only the rear window(s) is (are) opened, the closed front windows and closed sunroof vibrate badly and the air pressure in the car is such that it is painful to the ears.
