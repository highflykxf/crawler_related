The molding around the sunroof was rippled letting water in.The over head console has flooded twice, it leaked in the cargo area once, and as of Jan 2013 the front passenger side floorboard is saturated with water as I write this review.Beautiful vehicle, but poor quality for the money. I will never buy another Chevrolet again, disgusted with the quality of the vehicle and disgusted with Southern Chevrolet and their svc dept.",,

We got this 09 Tahoe last year and we love it so much it works like a truck so we treat it like one we also own a 04 Tahoe and it's just as nice, we even owned a 96 Tahoe... Just as nice.All Tahoe/suburban are just the perfect thing for everyone unless you want something huge or awesome.",,
4.75,First Tahoe,gb44 ,11/14/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Excellent build quality, nice ride, plenty of towing power for our travel trailer. Even my wife feels comfortable driving it, and usually she shies away from large vehicles, she does not feel intimidate in this vehicle.  I have owned several Silverados so this is familiar, but a lot easier to whip into parking places.","Comfortable interior, towing power.","They should include the integrated brake controller in the towing package. Removing the rear seats is a pain, they are very heavy and have to be stored."
4.125,Great Vehicle - Chevy Believer,Awesome SUV ,10/26/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,3,4,"This is my first true SUV and so far it's exceeded my expectations. I can honestly say after 20K miles of in town and highway driving, I would buy another Tahoe. Excellent driving experience and the gas mileage has been about as expected, actually slightly better. But I have to say I'm not a heavy on the gas either.",Comfort and highway driving absolutely great. I love it.,I'm a little on the tall side and front seats could be settled slightly lower but no problems.
3.5,Not like they used to be,lou ,10/08/2010,,,3,5,3,2,,4,4,2,5,This is my 2nd Tahoe. The 2009 has been taken back to the dealership 4 times in one year.  4 wheel drive failed 3 times and airbag system needed to be fixed.

4,Happy But---,SteveF ,01/19/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,3,4,"Overall a wonderful full size SUV that rides well, fits everything, and looks great. Don't gripe about the mpg - it's what you expect with a 6,000 lb vehicle. I take it on trips more often than my 7 series BMW since it's a great vehicle for travel. Only problems during past 12 months have been with driver's door squeak (still unresolved) and the battery or alternator whereby the vehicle is dead after 2-3 days of non-use. Apparently this problem is known to GM. Tomorrow is 2nd trip to dealer for this problem. Assuming problem is resolved, I highly recommend this SUV.","Seats, nav, dash layout, ride, overall comfort.",Fold-flat 3rd row seats; GM fix for dead battery.

The 6.2 4X4 has loads of power but unfortunately is averaging just 13.8 MPG to the 16 MPG of the 2WD 5.3 with only a 4 speed trans (No 8/4 mode on the 6.2). By far, the best truck GM has ever produced. Not quite the ride of the Escalade (no magnetic ride control in the Tahoe), but the Caddy didn't have low range (AWD only), and really, 12K more for a slightly bigger nav screen and 6 disc changer VS single disc? A no brainer. Build quality is very good, at least equal to Ford or Chrysler. ","Heated and cooled seats, bluetooth, XM Nav-Traffic, ","Hid's should be an option on these.

3.125,Disappointment,Bruce ,10/20/2009,,,3,4,4,2,,2,5,2,3,"Our purchase of a new Chevy Yukon has been a major disappointment to me.  My wife enjoys the size and ride but we have owned Suburbans for the past 20 years. The fuel mileage has been the biggest disappointment with mileage no better than 14mpg whether highway or in town.  Our old Suburban got 17 - 18 on the road. Performance is also not what was expected.  The engine has died in the middle of a turn and there seems to be a small miss when slowing for a turn and then accelerating.  Unexpectedly thee is NO storage under the seats or anywhere. All in all, for the money, I think a Lexus, BMW, or MB may have been a better idea.",,Get rid of the 8-4 engine.

What a difference in the ride. This Tahoe is very smooth, especially with the 6-speed. I have owned a 2002 Tahoe Z71 and the 2009 LTZ is almost like driving a different truck. The 6.2L has fantastic performance. My gas mileage around town is 13-14 mpg and on the highway about 17-18 mpg; however, my driving style does not place much priority on gas mileage.",Bose surround sound system and XM-Navigation radio.

4.75,Big Improvement Over Old Tahoe,Ed May ,05/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I recently traded in a 1999 Chevy Tahoe LT for a new 2009 LTZ model. The much reduced pricing and 0% interest made this an easy decision. I am very happy with the new model and the significant improvement in ride quality and technical advances over the previous model I owned. The miles per gallon has improved by about 15% over the old model, 16 mpg is achieved now with a 50/50 mix of highway and city driving.

4.5,Hate to get rid of the Astro,hauler ,04/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"Time to get a new vehicle for towing. After looking for a long time GM Tahoe/Yukon was only vehicle that could satisfy my fully loaded Astro replacement. PIck Tahoe for better looks. Nice smooth ride, but feel the jolts over potholes. Maybe because of 20inch wheels. Avg 20 mpg from NY to Va. Tranny and rear end was thumping when starting to descend on downhill and letting go of gas. Dealer reprogram tranny module. Seems to fix problem. Door molding began slight peeling. Dealer replace - like new. Otherwise really enjoy ride. I like my Garmin GPS better than GM GPS. Will use to tow boat on regular basis from NY to FL. Overall, good SUV for people who need towing. Gets same mpg as my Astro. ","Looks,fit and finish,quiet ride,tow capacity, front seat comfort, interior design and quality, due to current GM crisis dealer took 11k of sticker- couldn't walk away.",3rd row seat is not suited for adults; 2nd row seat should be able to recline for greater rear seat comfort on long distance;gps has limited features when driving but should have full feature if a front passenger is available; HD tow package should be standard
4.75,I am again a believer,What an SUV! ,04/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"We started looking for an SUV and wasn't sure what direction to go. My father in-law has a Yukon SLT and loves it. I have always been anti American when it comes to vehicles, I always stuck with Japanese. We also own a 07 Honda Pilot EX-L(w/nav) and absolutely love it, however my wife wanted something more roomy. So our search began. We looked at Toyota Sequoia....way too pricey, even the base SR5. Then we looked at Nissan Armada's, not bad but poor fuel economy, and drive too much like a truck. Then we drove an Expedition(Eddie Bauer), I was not impressed with the fit and finish and the steering was way too touchy. Then we drove our first Tahoe..I was impressed. Two days later we bought one","Bluetooth, 6 speed tranny, massive center console. 2009 4wd 5.3 V8 LT1 for less than 32k....we couldn't pass it up. We absolutely love this truck.","I have gone through this vehicle and the only thing I would probably change would be the 3rd row seat. I had to haul some stuff the other day and I pulled one of the seats out, very easy to do, but where do I keep this bulky seat in the mean time??"
4.875,Big Upgrade,AJK ,04/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought Tahoe Z71 after driving '02 JGCL.  Feels rock solid and very easy to drive, even with Z71 suspension.  Relative had '04 Denali, and this handles effortlessly in comparison.  Power is very good.  Roomy interior (had a 3 hour drive with 5 adults and 2 kids in car seats).  2nd and 3rd row seats are surprisingly easy to handle. ","Power folding 2nd row, back-up assist/camera, Z71 step tubes.  Power folding mirrors help for space in garage.  Active Fuel Management.

For its size, the Fahoe drives so easily around the city, and it's so comfortable inside.
