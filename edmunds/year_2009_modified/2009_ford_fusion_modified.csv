5,Best American Car Around,Darryl.G ,11/01/2016,,5,5,,,5,5,,5,,,"I have a 2009 Ford Fusion 4 cylinder and I've owned this car the last year and I've had nothing but good things to say out this car. I bought it last October with 200xxx miles. It now has 314xxx that's right I said 314,000 miles and it's still working like horse. The only things I had to do is replace the serpentine belt and get a wheel alignment other than that I haven't had to touch anything else. Just keep the oil changed and you'll be set like a arrow. Heat still blows hot and air is still ice cold.!!  If and when I do get rid of this car it'll be 2011 all wheel drive but this car has shown be no signs of even thinking about giving up. I have nothing bad to say about this car other than the front and rear bumper sometimes coming apart on the sides. I would recommend this car to anyone young or old.! It's meant for everyone. One of the best cars Ford has made thus far that I've seen",,
5,A good bang for your buck,cheyanne fincke ,06/23/2016,5,4,4,,,5,3,5,4,,,"Owned this car for 7 years, NEVER a problem. New set of tires, brake pads, oil changes every 3 thousand miles, thats all !!!!",,
5,"Smooth ride, great value, and safe (Update 05/16)",Clark Shin ,02/02/2016,5,4,4,,,3,5,5,5,,,"Updated 5/3/16:The sunroof started leaking with very small drips of water droplets through the front dome light area during heavy rain. Apparently, this has been an issue. Fortunately, the extended warranty covered the repair where the dealer replaced the sunroof glass. Without the warranty, I'm told the repair would have cost me $1,400. Anyway, no more leak after the fix so far. I'm taking a star off for reliability due to the sun-roof leaking. Still really enjoy driving the car though.Original Review:I was looking for a AWD sedan and found the 2009 Ford Fusion AWD V6 SEL to be the perfect fit for what I looking for to drive in the Northeast. I bought it 5 year old used car. The ride is smooth and the V6 provides very good power. The car is on the heavier side, but it feels sturdy and safe. The gear transitions are smooth and handles very well. For a non-luxury car, the quietness at highway speeds is completely acceptable. Navigation is very good and I like that it can be upgraded via a disk and not remotely. The seats are comfortable and the 2-level heated seats are great in cold seasons. I like the center compartment in the dashboard console where I can put a small tissue box and other small items. The sound system is great and bluetooth works very well. The value of the car is great. It does not look it and certainly it is nowhere near bonafide luxury, but with the SEL trim and the sporty handling with V6, this car has much to offer in comfort, safety, ride, quietness, and along with options such as navigation, rear parking sensor, heated seats and leather seating.There are some trouble spots, however. One major trouble spot is its ABS pump, which completely failed one day when driving over a pothole. I bought Ford PremiumCare when I bought the car and it paid off when the ABS failed, which I found out, is covered. I had to wait over a month for the local Ford dealership to get the part, because apparently Ford decided to provide a different ABS pump than the original one. My guess is that the original ABS pump was not very good, so Ford decided to assign a new one. Apparently, the brake is a common trouble spot with this year-model. Also, there is a cosmetic issue on the passenger side dashboard around the passenger side air bag. The outside material is popping out and you can see the yellow foam underneath it. I asked a Ford dealer and they said that it is merely a cosmetic issue caused by heat distorting the material, but it would not affect the air bag function. Visually, it is an eye sore. This is the only interior quality issue I've noticed, which is a significant one in my view.Now onto some things I don't like about the car. The trunk does not lift very easily. When you open the trunk, it only unlocks and it is quite heavy to lift it. The car doesn't tell you when the window washer fluid is low, so you have to guess when the fluid level is low. The navigation location is low, so when you glance at it, your vision is almost taken completely off of the road. I don't mind the manual reclining lever. I do wish the passenger side seat controls were also automatic and not completely manual.Other than these issues, I really like the car. It feels solid, drives very well, and safe. I prefer the old school 2006-2009 design that is less flashy and aggressive looking than the newer Fusions.",,

4.25,Best car i've ever owned hands down!,captain_fluffy ,10/16/2014,,,4,5,5,5,,3,4,4,4,"I bought my 09 SE Fusion w/Sport Appearance package (18"" low profile tire/wheels) with 23k miles on it. It was a lease out of Michigan and driven by some woman I can tell.

It now has close to 70k on it, and it hasn't ever skipped a beat! I did get it stuck in the snow twice, so having FWD with no traction control can be a PITA, but other than that, the car is wonderful to drive. Handles corners beautifully, takes bumps just fine (even with the low profile tires). I'm personally 6'1"" and I fit into it like a glove. ","The dependability, gas mileage, and ride.","The sport seats with the suede inserts can be a little bit of a pain to keep clean from time to time, but overall very nice seats. The sound system suits me just fine, but i'm sure for some of the pop music loving crowd, the bass won't be enough to keep up. The 2.3L is a GREAT engine, but it can be a bit of a dog, especially if you're converting from a faster car. It does pretty good to get out of it's own way, but it is in no way shape or form a fast car. The gas mileage is great for a fairly large mid-size car though."

There are no complaints at all. I'm only 20 so I had to look at reviews before making a purchase for a car and this car was by far the best option for the price. RELIABILITY! Waking up and being able to start your car everyday without any problems is so nice because my previous cars, a Mazda and a BMW have both been pains when you would start them in the cold and have to wait for the car to warm up to run efficiently!

Gotta tell you when you have a friend in the car and you hear the woman's voice come on people look at you with their jaws wide open. Best feature in the world!,I got the 4cyl so the only improvements I would give this car are put into the SEL model which is obviously more bang for the buck.

4.375,Very good car but...,Lee McCormick ,05/12/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,3,4,"I bought the 2300 4 with a 5 speed stick shift. I'm past the age of caring much about speed, and it's fast enough for me.  The tranny is a bit stiff going between 2nd and 3rd. It's fine if I shift at low rpm, but if I rap it out it frequently misses 3rd unless I double clutch it. I drive pretty sedately so it's not really a problem.  My main complaint is about the fuel economy. I get all they claimed, but I know they could do much better. My last car was a 1998 Mercury Marquis with a 5.0 liter V8. It got at least as good gas mileage as my little Fusion. I think they are sand bagging. I think it should be getting at least 35-40 mpg on the highway, and that's without any fancy technology.  ",,You should be able to get much better fuel efficiency.

I had never really considered a Ford before because of past history but with the reviews on Comsumer Reports about reliability of the Fusion, I figured it was worth the look.  So far, at 54K miles there has not been one problem and the comfort/quality is far beyond what I had come to expect from Ford.  Fuel is about 18-20 in town and 29- 31.5 on the highway (about 70mph).   Overall, the Fusion is an impressive car when considering the cost with what options Ford is offering.  SYNC is a really nice touch.","Comfort, power driver-seat, SYNC, low- cost for ownership.",Most suggestions I would make have been updated for the 2010 version.

I also have a Taurus and Ford Freestyle and have never had a problem with seat comfort before this.  The head rest (for my height at least) creates an uncomfortable angle, have turned the headrest around but this defeats the purpose of having it.

4.25,Great car,Jeff in Dallas ,03/12/2010,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,3,3,"I bought this car to replace a foreign sports sedan, and had a bit of trepidation because of that.  However, the car has great pickup, handles well, and is extremely comfortable.  I was pleasantly surprised about the amount of room inside - it is much bigger than it looks.  The ""SEL"" series has enough luxury touches to make this seem like a much more expensive car.  The only negative is that gas mileage (with the 6 cylinder engine) is not great - I average about 17 city, 21 mixed, 24 highway (although I've been told I have a lead foot) ","Quietness, pickup, and handling are all good.",My car doesn't have a passenger side power seat.

It really does have all the bells and whistles that a luxury car should have.  It looks very sporty and drives fantastic.  It's spacious feeling without feeling too big for most parking spots.  A little disappointed with the poor gas mileage for the V6, but the power upgrade is worth it.  ","I love the auto lights.  I am always worried I leave my lights on after I park and with this option, I don't even have to think about it!  I also really like the security lights that turn on when you unlock the car.

The car gives cues of a Lexus sedan, especially the front. Mine is equipped with Sport wheels and low profile tires and makes a tremendous difference in handling. 5 speed trans is good once it gets going in the higher ranges.  Gas economy is great on pure highway; I got up to 42 miles p/gallon and it's not a hybrid. My usual commute is 60% highway and 40% local,traveling 100 miles roundtrip. I'm averaging 27-29 miles per gallon. Not bad. Trip commuter works well and the SYNC system is a real tribute. I don't like the cartridge filter design; too messy.

Initially I was elated with my purchase and glad that I decided to buy American. I drive 100 miles round trip 5 days a week. The drive home in my roomy and comfortable Fusion was something I looked forward. And I only have to buy gas twice a week. Fast forward 10 months,I just had to get a new transmission and I am going online later to find a condenser.  The condenser issue really could have happened to anyone,(so they say)a little rock bounced into it .  It is just annoying that it happened 3 days after the transmission was replaced. Now everyday I dread the ride to and from work, wondering what will go wrong next",The 2009 Ford Fusion is a smooth roomy drive.  I love the seats and the trunk space.,Mesh cover of over the condenser.  A different design for the head rest.

My wife loves the size, maneuverability, and fuel economy.  I rated the performance lower, but we did pick the I4 for fuel economy.  Loads of room in the back for two growing 'tweens with plenty of leg room for me in the front. Anyway, Frannie (our name for our Fusion) took a direct hit centered on the driver and rear door.  The airbags deployed, the B-pillar was crushed, the C-pillar and roof line were creased, and the doors look like used aluminum foil.  However, my wife walked away with only some bruises from the seat belt, which she felt clamp down.

The more I drive this car, the more I like it.  I know that sounds corny, but I drive a miriad of vehicles and the Fusion is my favorite.  We looked at several other makes and actually decided on the Fusion because of price.  After getting the car, driving it and feeling the quality of the ride, I am totally happy with the car.  I think Ford hit a home run with the Fusion.",I really like the phone sync system and I love the Moon Roof.  I have it tilted up all the time...hot or cold.,"Only thing I wish my Fusion had was day time running lights....I have the I4-SE, so I turn my lights on manually for safety...I can live with that!  I manually straightened the head rests when I got the car...did not like the angle. I presume the angle was for improved safety. OK, don't turn me in!!"

Great ride and my wife and I love the room in the interior, the great sound system and the SYNC system. What really clinched the deal, however, was the $3500 incentive on top of a great deal that was just $400 above the invoice price.

Consider the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Chevrolet Malibu, Hyundai Sonata, or KIA Optima as better alternatives. The ride is smooth and fairly quiet. The engine is powerful enough, and the transmission shifts, precisely. Some of the controls are a little oddly placed, and not so easy to use on the steering wheel.

The car handles particularly well and the braking is excellent.  It is roomy inside even though it appears to be a smaller car from the outside.

The V6 and 6-speed auto are very smooth and I'm averaging 22 MPG after six weeks of driving half city, half freeway.

Considered the Honda Fit, Civic, Toyota Corolla all with the sport package option. When I looked at the Focus it didn't fit me well.

Now after 6000 miles I get about 27.5 MPG combined driving. Highway alone about 31.5 MPG. I am very happy with the Fusion. It looks good and it is fun to drive.

The dealer cash incentives were too big to ignore however, and once I drove the car, I fell in love with it. The SYNC is just amazing and I love the traction control and 4 wheel disk brakes. The acceleration is smooth and the braking firm. The Fusion has the best handling I have ever driven in a sedan and it looks really sharp in the driveway. 5* crash ratings and a 10.0 from JD Power for reliability sealed the deal.

When Ford announced the rebates of $3000 on Sept. 10, it made the decision very easy.  A brand new Ford Fusion SE with sunroof and sync for around $16000 is simply amazing. I paid $18000 for a new Mazda MX-6 in 1994 with less features than today, obviously.  I have the 5-speed, I4. I have always loved 5-speed cars, and this one is no exception.
