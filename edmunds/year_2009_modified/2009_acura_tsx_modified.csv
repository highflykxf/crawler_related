4,Agreed with a Luxuary car with cheap leather seats,Regena Smith ,10/26/2016,4,4,1,,,4,3,4,5,,,"The leather seats will tear up before 2 year mark.  I have a 2009 Acura TSX that i bought brand new in 2008. I had to commute for work and my miles were about 200 over the warranty so the dealership took pics of the car stated that his district manager had to approve if seats could be fixed, no one called back so I made the first move and called to be told no, there is nothing we can do about it.  I also received a letter in the mail about an oil consumption recall and was told that I was over miles but they may be able to work something out. I had to pay for a timing chain to be replaced on the car right at 100000 miles and was told that they don't make these cars like they use to not only am I embarrassed about the seats that have been torn for a while while making car payments now because the car is not worth the hassel. I asked when does it states that there is a certain mileage on a recall to get vehicle fixed for free this is not my 1st car.  I will never purchase another one looking at getting an Audi this month better quality. There need to be a lemon law on this car new or used .",,
4,TSX Review for Used Car Seekers - Check Oil Issue,Paul ,02/13/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,4,4,,,"I am the original owner a black, 4cyl TSX with 6 speed manual transmission. It now has 96k miles of more than half highway miles. Oddly enough, I'm more pleased with the car as it ages. Why? Because it's still performing very well, despite the expectation for an older car to start acting up. Power is good, handling is still tight, no rattles, the auto climate control is spot on. The 6 speed short shifting manual mated to a smooth clutch that doesn't buck in slow traffic is pleasure to drive. Manual lovers would like this car, and the engine is happy to rev.  Fuel economy has been 30 mpg with my type of driving. This is excellent for a car with decent power.The TSX handles pretty well in snow when mated with good all-season or winter tires. I am very happy with Continental PureContact Eco+ DWS. They drive well in snow and the traction control, when needed, works in concert with these to provide good control. I used to have Bridgestone Pole Position, which handled even better in dry and wet conditions but were horrible in snow. Surprisingly, the Continentals actually have improved fuel mileage by at least 1 mpg, as they claim.Rear seats are more suitable for smaller people. The door opening is a little tight getting in, but the seats are very comfortable once in. Child seats are a pain to use because of the bucket shape and the closeness of the latch. Now that my kids are beyond that, we happily use the TSX for our family of 5 over our Odyssey, especially when parking will be tight.My few issues:Bluetooth function for the non-Nav version is clunky so I prefer to use my ear bud for making calls. I have a vent-mounted phone holder to make calls easier and to facilitate using GPS on my phone.91 octane is tough to find so one usually has to pay for 93 octane. This is the price for getting 200 hp out of a 4 cylinder engine.This model year had brakes that wore prematurely but that is not an issue after I replaced them with non-OEM pads. I had to have the clutch master cylinder (small cylinder located at the clutch pedal) replaced at about 85k miles. Acura granted me a discount for this service when I complained that it was premature. The clutch is still in great shape. Last, but not least, the engine consumes oil. Acura has extended the engine warranty to 8 yrs/125k miles. Their threshold for warranty work (changing piston rings) is burning more than 1 qt per 1000 miles. My engine consumes about 1/2 qt. I wonder if this issue occurs because people followed the maintenance minder for oil changes. I was driving 8k miles or even more before it would call for oil changes. I think following that was a mistake. I'm living with it and it does not seem to be getting worse now that I change oil at 5k miles.I expect my TSX to continue to age well, and plan to pass it down to my kids when it's about 10 yrs old with 150k+ miles.",,
4,Don't think twice just buy it!,Mark Wilmes ,10/23/2015,5,4,4,,,5,4,5,4,,,"I bought my TSX used in early 2014. My company moved from the suburbs to downtown so my commute changed from an easy 10 minutes on a turnpike to 20-30 minutes of Indy 500 with crack-ups and rescue vehicles included, and I'm so glad I bought the TSX instead of some larger sedans or SUV's I was looking at. My wife has a 2011 Pilot EXL so the need for another SUV really wasn't there anyway.  We've had or still have six Honda's and two Acura's plus Mazdas and Nissans and some Fords. I'm getting over 25 MPG even with all the stops and starts and racing that I'm doing. I use the paddle shifters ALL THE TIME and it's so cool to pass or get around someone and then to accelerate and just get away from them (even within the speed limit, the acceleration is awesome).  I did read the reviews about geting the 6 cylinder if you can find one, and I did test drive a 4 cylinder and then a 6 cylinder, back to back and the 6 is spectacular.   I wasn't quite ready to pull the trigger, and the color of the 6 cylinder was white and I prefer black. The paddle shifters make the 4 cylinder a blast.  This car is very fun to drive.  It's easy to find a 4 cylinder in the color combination you want, and when you do, just buy it!  I got mine with 64,000 miles on it and I'm at 104,000 after 20 months.  I'll probably take it to 135,000 miles and then sell it and get a 2013 or 2014.  This car is great for getting around in the parking garage, and my 17-year old son and his buddies think it's pretty slick!",,
4,"Great car to drive, lasts well. Still some minor i",yitz1 ,05/21/2014,4,4,5,,,5,4,4,4,,,"I love my TSX. It's roomy in the front and handles great. It has a lot of good standard features. It has a lot of pizzaz for a 4 cyl. The main problem I have with it are unexpected expenses. I just had to buy a new tire and rim for the second time after hitting a pothole ($1000!). Stupid low profile tires. Unless you live in a place with few potholes, this can be a big problem. Also, it a little plastic piece around the side mirror broke. I figured it would be under $25 to replace. No such luck. They don't sell just that piece. I had to buy a whole new mirror for over $300.   Addendum:  Well, 8 years and running. Still rides good, though a bit rough. No real mechanical problems. Tires and rims still fragile and a problem. Repairs still expensive.   Addendum (11/16): Still drives great, no mechanical problems. Still looks good for a car that old. Still same minor complaints (especially the tires).",,

Pros, I love the interior look of the car. The design of the dashboard is pretty sleek and I think everything flows really nicely. Especially the gauges at night. You get a pretty nice feel from the shifter. but lately it feels like it kinda ""clunks"" in to 3rd instead of slipping in like it usually does. And with the tech package, you get one of the best sounding factory audio settings Cons: with that said about the audio, the speakers are bad quality. I've had 3 speakers blow since owning the car, and I listen at moderate to low levels only. Handling is subpar.","GPS - I've only used a few GPS systems, but the GPS on the tech package is probably my favorite. At first i thought it was going to be difficult to us the GPS compared to a touch screen, but it is very easy to navigate though the menus with the nob thing.

5,Real nice!,WA husky ,09/05/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We have had this car for a year. It is comfortable, sporty, and fuel efficient. Zero problems. We wanted something upscale, safe, and completely reliable, and we got it. We felt this was also the best value in its class. While other cars may have better performance specs, we are not stunt drivers and in our urban environment, there's not much need for huge amounts of power or acceleration, although I have not found the car lacking when accelerating onto the highway from an on ramp, for example.

Since I'm stuck in LA's traffic 90% of the time, the 4 cyl is more than enough for all situations. My main initial complaint was with the too stiff suspension. It has softened a little bit, but still a jittery ride on any surface. Too much for my comfort but I got used to it. It's quiet now that I changed the cheapo and noisy Michelins that came with the car. I put some Bridgestone Serenity (55X17) and what a difference they make.

Researched quite a bit and chose over an Audi A4 based on expected reliability and price/feature content. Former 04 Accord coupe 6 speed owner. Gonna buy another new Accord coupe, but drove an automatic and hated it. Drove the TSX and TL after driving the Honda coupe and Acura much better car to me...less road noise, better interior, etc. Accord never went back to the dealer for service in 5+ years...that sold me on Acura over Audi. However, have already been back with break squeal and now have a blown front speaker...not happy about this. Ride is firm, but about right, quiet, refined, handles very well.","Stereo is great, not considering blown speaker, hopefully an easy fix. Bluetooth is nice and Nav is nice, although not used that much. Gas mileage has been very good. Average about 24 mpg. Computer shows about 1 to 1.5 higher than actual. Seats are firm, but comfortable. Decent acceleration. ","Steering feel is ok, but not as good as my accord coupe. Brakes are ok, but could be better."
5,TSX is so enjoyable to drive!!!,TSX123 ,10/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this vehicle three months ago and still I'm in love with it. It's steering and turn radius is great. It's sleek and sexy looking with a sporty feel. It's great for city driving because it's still a smaller sedan, but big enough where you don't get bullied on the road or feel unsafe if you were to get in an accident. The interior is very stylish and although the buttons/navigation system can seem intimidating, it's not difficult to understand how to use it. ","The navigation/advanced sound system package is amazing. The stereo and speakers are not only loud and great quality, but it has amazing surround sound. You can hear everything coming at you from all sides. It's awesome!!!!","The only thing that I think Acura could work on is the road noise. At times it can seem loud, but all the other benefits make up for it. "

Steering is not bad (could use more feel). The car likes to be driven fast (unlike my old 06 TL 6M which suffered from serious torque steer and an unhappiness when driven fast). It is also very comfortable and fits like a glove, everything feels right. Love the features: seats, steering wheel, FI paddle shifters, Bluetooth, USB audio (all cars should have this). HOWEVER, there is excessive dashboard glare that washes out the central display in a lot of driving conditions!!

Bought it in October 2008 and have logged 17K+ miles to date.  No defects at all!  I shopped Lexus, BMW etc. and settled on the TSX.  Final choices came down to new TSX or used TL (or used BMW 330xi).   Former Honda owner so in the end I wanted reliability and sacrificed AWD.  The car is a pleasure to drive (quiet, no rattles etc.).  For pure fun, I would have bought the BM'r, but did not want to face any downstream reliability or expensive maintenance.   The only minor negative is the car is really so-so in the snow (even with snows) ... traction is not great.  Everything else meets or beats my expectations!   ","Satellite radio, Acura ownership experience (zero issues to date with the car), exterior appearance and very happy with MPG (averaging close to 30 MPG as I do mostly highway driving).",1) I would never own another car if Acura added a model with AWD (the TL is a little too big and pricey). 2) Back seat area is a bit tight - not too bad though.
4.75,"It's still new, but...",Woodlands  ,08/28/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"So after driving some (used) BMWs and Infiniti's, I settled on this as it is brand new and has all the tech features I want.  I didn't want to drop another $8-15k for the same things.  So far I am very impressed with the performance, although it doesn't match BMW or Infiniti.  That's not why I bought it.  I do not race cars for a living, I drive near 80 miles per day commuting.  I need fun and comfort.  This car delivers on these.  From the very intuitive voice recognition, to the sat radio and USB interface, there is so much fun to be had here. While it is much maligned by um... ""professional"" reviewers, I thoroughly love this car.  For under $30k it more than meets my needs and wants.

This Acura drives like a dream and I look forward to starting it up every day.  The standard features along with the Tech package give you almost every advanced feature imaginable.  The performance is almost comparable to the BMW (steering is a bit remote on the highway compared to a BMW) and is much more reliable (also, less expensive to fix - it is a Honda after all).  I researched cars for quite some time before buying and could not find another car that combined luxury, performance, tech features, and style as well as the Acura TSX!",I love the style inside and out.

The grill-design has grown on me as well. Steering feel is also fine; it is materially better compared to my old car (a 2004 V6 Camry). While not perfect, it is still a very good daily-driver in my opinion.    ","Great gas mileage. Large fuel tank. Lots of standard features. Feels very solid and safe. Great handling compared to my old Camry. Very comfortable front seats. Interior materials are first rate. Acceleration is above-average for a 4 cylinder car.

Disappointed with the occasional engine ""bay-rattle"" and brake squeal noises I hear. Too much glare on center information display on bright sunny days.

For myself, over the past 25 years I have only purchased Honda Accords (all manual trans.).  My last 2 have been EX- L and I have always been happy with them.  I was planning since last year to buy myself another EX-L Accord (4- cyl) and just by chance I checked out the TSX.  I loved it.  It came with everything, factory installed, even options like memory seats, passenger power seats, home-link, and directional signals on outside mirrors that you couldn't even get on a loaded 4cy EX-L Accord.  In my opinion, the car is so much more solid & luxurious than the Accord.

Excellent fuel economy, great features, nice design, and Honda/Acura reliability made this a no-brainer to buy.  I, like many, am not overly thrilled with the electronic steering, and it took some getting used to.  Frankly, now, however, I don't notice that it's any different from any other car I've driven.

For whatever reason, there is no option to dial your calls out, without using the voice activation system (which means the car has to hear and understand your VERBAL commands).  This means that when you can't get your verbal command through to the car, that you're basically not able to call out.  For a luxury car, this is absolutely unacceptable.  I understand this is new technology, but they could easily have allowed for a way to dial out calls without using the very flawed voice activation.","I love the overall quality of the car, except for the voice activated commands, which is SEVERELY flawed. You can tell that this car was built with GREAT quality, and I love the ride, way the car handles, the interior comfort, and the looks.","FIX THE VOICE ACTIVATION SYSTEM!!!

The dealer said it was known issue; Acura had issued a service bulletin to address this problem. The dealer kept the car  to carry out the fix.  Picked up the car but the noise returned shortly before I arrived home. Very disappointed in Acura for producing a defective product then selling it with a known problem. The Navi system has also been acting up. Generally the car has a spirited feel to it with a responsive engine. However the on-center feel at highway speeds is very poor-one needs to constantly correct steering. The seats are too firm and leave you sore after a road trip.,Navi system - when it's working; upgraded sound system is truly incredible - best feature of the car; blu-tooth and i-pod set up; fuel economy is decent; interior materials are quite good.,Improve the seats - Saab and Volvo seats would be good examples to emulate; fix the steering at highway speeds so it is more firm with a stronger on-center feel

I've always driven manuals, but the auto TSX is plenty of fun, and I enjoyed it more than the 6-speed.  The car is nimble, extremely comfortable, and is a bargain. Some complain that it's not as muscular as a BMW 3 series or an Infiniti G37. This is true. It's also many thousands of dollars less expensive. For me, this was the sweet spot of price/performance. I have only owned the TSX for a month, so my ""reliability"" score is at this point more of a hope than a rating.","The interior fit and finish is simply superb.  It feels like it was carved from a solid block of material by elves with jeweler's tools.  The handling is taut, and there is very little body roll when manhandling corners.  ","I found the brakes to be a little anemic for a car in this class - they're not poor, but they're not exceptional either.  Other than that, I'm perfectly happy.  I smile every time I get into the car.  And isn't that what it's all about?"

4.75,I Love This Car,Michael ,05/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Though less than a month old, I am in love with this car.  I previously owned a 2005 Volvo S40 turbo, and while I have nothing but good things to say about that car, I think I like my 2009 TSX better.  The interior can feel a bit like the cockpit of a 747 at first, but within days I was comfortable navigating and controlling it.  The nav system with integrated blue tooth and iPod is a dream, and the the backup camera, while cheesy, is a nice touch.  The only drawback to this car is power.  At barely over 200HP, it seems hesitant to accelerate.  The handling and braking work like a champ, but I would love to see this with a turbo.

The louder the road noise the louder the static gets when you increase the volume to listen while using the bluetooth.

It's slightly bigger and wider than the old TSX but it comes loaded for the price... I would have had to get so many upgrade packages in other makes to get the base model on the TSX!

Yes, with 4 cylinders you don't feel that extra umph of power you get from a V6 but it's more than enough, especially from city driving.  I get 29.4 miles to the gallon (calculated).

The TSX is seemingly slower (much heavier than the MZ3) and has a terrible engine rattle, which is widely reported. Dealers are stating this is a ""normal"" sound. I would probably be happier with the car overall if it had more power and the engine didn't sound like my 1993 Saturn with 180,000 miles on it. There are also tons of rattles in the cabin, which the dealer (of course) can not duplicate.","iPod integration, (even though my 3G iPhone always says ""unsupported"").

5,A Great Car,tjny ,05/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the TSX with tech package one month ago and could not be happier with it. I traded in a 2003 BMW 325 and enjoy driving this car as much or more than the BMW. It has plenty of power for me and has a nice balance between a luxury ride and a sporty look and feel. I really love all the tech features, especially the sound system and voice-activated controls.  I looked at the Lexus IS250 and BMW 328 but neither of them could compare with the price point and value of the TSX in terms of size and features. Anyone who is looking for this size and type of car in the luxury arena should give serious consideration to the TSX.","Interior design, comfortable ride, excellent sound system, voice- activation for all controls, excellent gas mileage--so much car for the money.

For some reason its fashionable to be negative these days and they go out of there way to be just that about the 2009 TSX.  Read the user reviews instead!  We are the ones who drive this car on a daily basis and appreciate how well engineered this car truly is. They expect this to be a race carits not get over it!  This is a really fun affordable sport sedan to drive. I test drove everything in the $25-38K range and the TSX offered the most bang for the buck. ,"I drive 100 miles a day on the So Cal freeways. I wanted a car that was comfortable, got good gas mileage, reliable, safe with updated styling and a decent sound system with iPod connection.  This car delivers on all accounts, especially the navigation and sound systemAwesome!  ","I do run Chevron premium gas (no pinging problem). Surprised at how many heads this car turns, I wasnt expecting that!  Keyless start would be nice.

This is arguably the best car on the market under $30k for what the car offers as standard features.  Bought mine 12/31/08, am 5,000 miles in, and still have a smile on my face every time that I drive it.  GREAT vehicle for Road trips.  Overall, a very economical car.  For a smoother ride, I recommend not putting on aftermarket low-profile tires/rims.","6 speed manual super smooth shifting, iPod integrated dash, dual climate control, VERY comfortable seats, excellent styling both inside and out, great fuel economy, dashboard and steering controls, Xenon headlights, Hands Free Link (HFL) for bluetooth-enabled phone, dual fold-down rear seats.","Rear deck is tan/beige, even on black interior.

After seven months and numerous trips to the dealership, the problem has not been corrected.  Acura doesn't seem to know how to fix the problem and the dealerships are not willing to try any more repairs.  For 30K the brakes should not constantly squeal.  What an embarrassment for a vehicle considered luxury.  Stay away from this car.  For the money buy a Lexus IS.  If I go back I would leave this car on the lot.

Manual tranny is super though still getting used to that 6th gear. The engine, while not stout, performs superbly...you hardly notice when running at high revs...and MPG compares to my old VW Passat turbo despite being a heavier car (though the MPG reading calculated by the TSX is inflated about 10% vs actual).  The interior comfort, esp the seats, are great...and the features (Ipod; XM; homelink; bluetooth) are amazing for the price.  Definitely worth a close look! ","Nice firm ride and firm leather seats. Six speed manual. Bluetooth and all the audio options. Instant MPG feedback. Oh yeah, and I have about $7 or 8 grand in my pocket compared to buying a comparably equipped A4!!","Let's be honest, the exterior styling is a bit dull. Layout of audio selections and channels are too close though the steering wheel controls help. And the glare from the audio screen is brutal on a sunny day. A bit slow from a dead stop.

I looked at TL-SHAWD, but could not get over the BEAK.  I also wanted a manual, fund to drive car with high reliability, low maintenance costs and good gas mpg.  This car fulfills all of that and is a pretty comfortable driver to boot.  Mileage is averaging 28-31 mpg, 6 spd is easy to use and car is not so ""hot"" that I am adding too many speeding tickets to my collection.

Excellent gas mileage. A well engineered car that is an excellent value when compared with others in its class. Love the black exterior also. Love driver seat memory setting as well.",Gas cap release button inside the car. I think the lumbar support button in the new TL is more effective and easier to use than the one in the TSX which is placed on the right side of drivers seat. Maybe sportier wheels but I really have no serious complaints about this car.
4.875,This car has a good value,Nick ,01/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I changed my mind a day before to purchase an 09 Accord EXL V6. I made a great deal on both vehicles. I only had to pay 1000 more to get a TSX. The new V6 Accord engine is new in the market with the 3/4/6 cylinder running mode. Didn't like that. Didn't know the TSX is in my price range. TSX was quieter than Accord. Better suspension, better material (leather), comes with HID, and better interior. With only $1000 difference I'm going for the TSX. The engine is slightly noisier than my 08 TL, but 4 cyl. is expected to do that.",Most premium for the price. Good look in and out. Built by Honda. Good material. Cannot think of anything bad compared to Honda accord EXL V6. ,"The control panel was not as intuitive than I expected. I like cars which I can operate even without looking at manuals. Had a trouble turning off the radio. These are minor, and I was being very picky. Overall good car. "
5,Outstanding Car,Ualboy2 ,01/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a outstanding car. The interior quality is refined and conveys quality. Nav is easy to use and the gauges are cool looking. The ELS sound system is truly  fantastic. The car has plenty of power for Its size, and when I tell people it's only a 4 cyl. They can't believe it. I personally love the new exterior look. It looks aggressive but classy. The steering is not as bad as some reviews have stated, and really you would need to be on a track to notice any difference. I will admit the ride can be a bit stiff, so if   you are looking for a cushy ride, this may not be the car for you. This car has an outstanding value compared to BMW, and Audi.

5,One of the Best,acuralover4life ,12/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We absolutely love our TSX. So far we have had no problems out of it. We decided to just get the Base w/auto model. Mainly because we didn't want to spend an extra $3,000 on a navigation system where as you can get a portable one for $200 at many stores. We have had it for a little over 3 months and it already has over 3,000 miles on it. One thing I do wish is that we would have waited and looked at the new TLs. Another thing is that I wish it would have is an inside fuel door release instead of having to have to push it on the outside.","Driver linked keys, dual-zone auto climate control, sunroof, heated seats, leather, bluetooth, and iPod integration cord.",Keyless access and starting like the new TLs and fuel door release on the inside.
4.625,A pretty good balance,mshw777 ,12/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"I purchased the 09 TSX as a 2nd vehicle (keeping my Toyota truck because you always need a good truck around the house). The TSX is feature rich in interior technology, is well built, looks pretty good, and performs well enough, plus I'm getting about 26 mpg combined. It's not the best entry level sport sedan out there, nor the most luxurious.  However, this 09 TSX gives you a good little mix of everything at a decent price: cool technology, basic sportiness, touch of luxury, great build quality, nice redesigned looks, great gas mileage.  When all combined together, it's a pretty good balance. Happy with the purchase so far, especially when others around the same class cost more $$.","Neat technology inside, USB connection, center console loaded with features, nice information availability via the steering controls, Bluetooth, leather seat warmer, dual climate control, build quality, great gas mileage.","Engine is peppy enough, but beefing the engine up a shy bit in hp wouldn't hurt."
4.75,So Far So Good,Chunster ,12/20/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Having owned this car for less than a week, I can tell you it was a better choice than the other cars that I have researched (VW CC, Camry XLE, Altima 2.5SL and Hybrid, Maxima S).  My goal was to find a car that was the best bang for a price range of $25-30k. In the end, the TSX had the most features for your dollars, as well as a luxury feel and quality. The only negative is the premium fuel requirement. The other thing I will need to get use to is the seating requires you to lean back more than I am use to (comfortable feeling but different from the other cars).  I hope to put in another review after a few months of use.","Steering wheel controls, bluetooth works flawlessly, HID lights, decent engine, standard sound system is more than adequate.","Center Display Console could use an upgrade from the text based display. Beverage holder should be removable for cleaning, keyless entry should be standard.

4.25,Complains when pushed,Neil ,12/17/2008,,,5,4,4,5,,4,5,4,3,"I bought my new TSX over labor day, trading in both a leased '05 RL and a Mazda 3 wagon.  I was a hair's breadth away from buying a V6 Accord, but decided to go for the extra bells and whistles of the TSX.  Someone told me I'd just bought a $32,000 iPod accessory (which may have a grain of truth).   While I think the car has plenty of power, and I love the gas mileage, the poor little engine thrashes and complains under even moderate load.  I took it to the dealer complaining that the engine was knocking (it was really that bad!), but they said to just use Shell or Chevron premium.  That didn't really help.  I expected better from Honda.","iPod interface, navigation, bluetooth, comfort, gas mileage",Either fix the valves or add some insulation so I don't have to hear them complaining!

At first I was a little unhappy due to it being somewhat bigger.  After having it one week I was already in favor of the size.  It is amazing how much smoother the ride is due it being a little wider and longer.  I already knew it was built off the previous TL frame.  When I drove it off the lot it had 280 miles on it.  It now has 1200 on it and I've only filled the tank twice.  I purchased the manual this time and the gas mileage is amazing!  They say the auto. is to get better mileage, I don't think so!  I got 450 on my first tank, 450 on my second!  Go buy it!  Seriously!","Bluetooth, audio plug in for iPod, 8 speaker surround sound, smoothness in turns, GAS MILEAGE!",A little sportier in looks.

It was fixed but then a different noise appeared from the trunk. So far it has been in the shop twice for the trunk rattles.  This the trunk rattles are back along with a weird noise coming from the steering column.  So this will be the 3rd visit in 5 months to the dealership.

My one complaint is the driver's seat lumbar support... it hits just too high on the back and it isn't really possible to dial it back enough to really find a comfortable setting for the seat. This would not be my choice of car for a longer journey.  Otherwise, it is quiet, plenty powerful, and offers good road feel.  Steering is a little light but one gets used to it.  I'd prefer an easier to read set of dash readouts.... black on gray isn't as good as my Accord which has brighter displays.",Quiet ride and body firmness,"Seats (add passenger height adjustment, redo or permit more adjustment of driver lumbar support), dash readouts brighter."
4.625,Great Car,Bay Area Guy ,11/23/2008,,,5,3,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just bought a 2009 TSX with Technology package and so far am very happy with it.  Handles great, automatic transmission is very smooth, has every conceivable bell and whistle, navigation system is great, and sound system is superb.  Gas mileage has been very good and engine is pleasantly peppy for a 4 cylinder car.  The taut sports-like suspension was my only concern during the test driving, but I have come to appreciate the feel for the road it communicates.  Overall am very happy with the car so far, and especially love the stellar sounds system with iPod integrated out of sight in the center console.","Taut handling, quality feel, stellar sound system, great navigation system, sense that TSX is an upscale car at a great price with just about every option you can possibly think of.","Exterior styling is kind of bland - interior is actually better styled than exterior to my eye.

Who ever heard of a car with a rear suspension that is stiffer than the front?   This car jiggles everywhere and no my tires are not overinflated.   For short trips this is ok, but so uncomfortable and exhausting on any long drive.  Also the steering is too hard, with no feel for the road.   I will sell it soon and buy a smoother riding car.

The ELS music system is outstanding combined with the GPS which comes with a back up camera - in my mine no car for this price can compare. The car is very quiet for a 4 cylinder and has more than enough power. The fit and finish is perfect. It's just the size car I needed with all the bells & whistles.

It's not as fast my other tl type s - but the horsepower and torque is not wasted either. That's what this car is, it's the comfort of the tech package (do not get this car without it) with a car that's designed for everyday use with some sport appeal. It's definitely fun to drive, it comes to stock with a stability bar for handling, can you believe that? It's car loaded with value and a fun drive factor to boot.

I looked at the IS, A4, MB C-class, Volvo's of various models, and the TSX won hands down with $, features & reliability. Magnificent car.  Love the navi knob - a touch screen would require the eyes to be 'off the road'. My TSX has a telescoping steering wheel and a 6 disc in-dash CD player. All my friends love my car.

Although exterior styling resembles the circa 2006 models, this is a total redesign inside and out. Added length and width make this car appear as large as a pre-2009 TL. Inside, this benefits rear seat passengers, who now enjoy a lot more legroom. Other interior differences are the premium sound, which - on the non-tech - is FAR superior to the rather dismal offering in my 2006 TSX, and includes a sub woofer for deep and thumping bass.","This car has heaps of new features compared to 2008 & prior models. The 2009 TSX non-tech comes with tire pressure sensors, automatic headlights, and a USB dock, allowing control of an iPod OR a standard USB flash drive from the steering wheel!","Wheel styling is seriously lacking. The rims are identical to those found on older (circa 2005) TLs. This is probably a strategy to ""update"" future models, but at terrible cost to the 2009.

The 2009 TSX is a far superior vehicle in terms of driving comfort, acceleration, handling, cabin noise, low speed maneuverability, turning radius, fuel economy, and overall refinement.  I have read the professional reviews and my conclusion is that these people drive the car for a few hours on a test track in situations that are not representative of daily driving conditions for the average buyer of this vehicle.  Having said that, I do agree, that 2009 TSX is not a sports sedan and probably should not be marketed as one by Acura.  ",A fine daily driver and represents a good value for a vehicle that lists under $30K. ,"During night driving with little or no ambient light, the rear center brake light emits a bright red aura due to a reflection from the rear windshield (this problem does not exist in my 2005 TSX, and diminishes somewhat in the presence of another vehicles headlights).

That being said, the power and the pickup is far greater. Acura maximizes the ability of a 4 cyl engine while making it fuel efficient. Getting about 27-29 mpg in 70-30 highway driving. I'd advise not to take your MPG reading off the monitor and actually calculate it yourself, you'll find it to be about 1-2 MPG difference, but still great mileage. Note that this is an everyday sports sedan. If you want a high performance sports car, get a BMW 3 series or Lexus IS-250. The rest of us who go to work everyday, want to have a little fun and not pay a fortune in doing so will enjoy this car","Lots of luxury features for the buck.

Big mistake. They've taken the fun out of driving with the addition of electronic steering. I can't feel the car. I feel detached from the whole experience I used to love about driving. The odd thing is, the suspension is still tight enough to feel the road beneath me, while still giving it stability in the corners, which I can no longer feel. The slight increase in size from the previous model wasn't put to good use. The interior feels cavernous, adding one more level of remove from the ""feel"" of driving. ",The stereo and iPod integration are awesome. 32 MPG. Solid build. Rear view camera. All the toys are fun.

Keep in mind, I switched from a V6 with over 240 HP and torque.  I was hesitant about getting a 4 cyl, but you can't tell the difference in every day driving with this car.  It has more than enough power, I'm not drag racing from a stop sign or traffic light.  The handling is excellent.  The interior is top of the line Japan quality, and has more room than the Lexus IS.  I didn't need the navi system, but the stock premium audio sound systems sounds great!","Xenon lights, fold down rear seats, XM radio.",Remove chrome from front grille.

But the features for price, comfort, drive won hands down!  Car drives great, awesome handling with steering, good acceleration (use pedal shifters... fun!). I've always wanted an Acura, and this was the exact way to finally step into the brand! Had considered the '08 and the '09 TSX. The redesigned exterior of the '09 is what won me over and took a bigger chunk out my pocketbook.","Bluetooth, hands-free commands, the look! Love the exterior look and design! Gas mileage... same that I was getting with my '08 hybrid that I traded in. ","Bluetooth!! People complain it's hard to hear when I'm using it. Glare in nav/radio screen. Also, why not have it touchscreen, and move forward. Key - make it a FOB, with push-button start. Voice commands could be improved. Reposition mic to better catch driver speaking."

MPG has been great - 36+ hwy and 30+overall.  I still haven't mastered the tech pack. That lady doesn't understand KYeze.

In a lot of magazines reviews and forums people slam this car as not as good as the old and not as powerful as the G35, etc. It costs another 5 grand to get the same options on these other cars. For the money this is the best thing going.The old car got great reviews and this car is even more improved than that one. I like the styling, and from what I have seen it is the best looking car in the new Acura lineup. This car is not sluggish at all, but it is not made for drag racing. What I value most of all in terms of performance is the handling. This thing takes corners well and I've never gotten a ticket for cornering. The tech package is the way to go hands down.", The technology package is great. The paddle shifters are fun to have for when you're in the mood. For me the fold down seats are key. I looked at many cars that didn't have them. I can take the boss to lunch in this car and then later that day throw my surfboard in it and hit the beach.,"  Acura could have made it an option to be able to get a higher 240 horsepower engine, but then your cost would be right up  around a TL anyway. I don't have many complaints at all for the money. It's sporty, yet practical and will take me into my thirties with a modest touch of class."

I didn't do the performance package because it wasn't worth the extra $3000.00 when I can use my handheld Garmin instead. The steering is very sensitive at highway speeds and needs a gentle touch.  I'm only getting about 24 mpg with a combination of around town and highway.  I was between the TSX, the Honda Accord & Audi A4. I am very happy with my decision.  There is plenty of leg room both front and back.  I had a friend who was 6'4"" comfortably in the back.

Being my first new car purchase out of graduate school, I knew I wanted the reliability of Acura (read Honda) and practical, while still sporty.  This fits the bill perfectly.   Sure, the grille looks a little odd (or Mazda/Saturn-like), but that's about the only gripe for me.  The i-VTEC engine is a great blend of spunk, fuel efficiency and environmental friendliness (even though I'm not on the ""save the planet boat,"" it's still impressive to see a ULEV vehicle that can still perform).  The six-speed transmission and the tech package are the way to go!","Spunky, practical, reliable, and amazing value for the amount of technology packed in there!  At fully loaded, it's still below the base price of comparable alternatives: BMW, Lexus, Audi, etc.  The six-speed is a blast, also.","Like everyone else, a turbo-charged engine and all-wheel drive.

I did a ton of research and the longer I've had the car the happier I am with the purchase.

After 4000 miles now in my TSX, I can tell them the TSX is definitely worth the extra few grand over the Accord.  The ride is better, the materials and fit and finish is a notch above that of the Accord.  And the Accord is just a little bit too big for me.  Looked at competing products from Lexus, Audi, BMW, etc. and the TSX cannot be beaten in terms of value.  Load up the others with the same options as in the TSX and you can expect to pay much more.

Traded in a Camry Hybrid for more than I paid for it 8 months ago w/9k miles on it and couldn't pass on the opportunity.  The Camry Hybrid averaged 35 miles per gallon and was a bit uncomfortable, not fun to drive, and most of all I felt that the current hybrid hoopla will soon be looked upon like a fad as new technology is introduced.  The '09 TSX gets ""near"" what I got with the Camry Hybrid, but is more fun and the intention is to drive it to 150k+ miles like I did with my 97 TL (my 03 MDX has 80k miles on it).

I decided, however, that I needed to make a change for better reliability and the addition of two doors for practicality.  Albeit it's only been about ten days, but I am pleasantly surprised at how much I have fallen in love with my TSX. It has all of the amenities that my BMW had and more. The fit and finish is impressive. Fuel economy is about twenty percent better - 24 mixed in the BMW to 29 in the Acura. People on the street even stop me to ask about it.","Luxury feel - solid and quiet, six speed transmission - sport feel with short, quick throws, stereo - the sound is killer and the USB port for my iPod integrates it into the stereo, engine - high revving, sport feel, looks - people didn't comment on my BMW this much, headlights - Xenons are great","Engine - it could use a little more torque, a/c - it could be stronger to cool faster, windshield wipers - a rain sensing feature would be more convenient"

5,09 TSX is Absolutely Amazing!!,Yanks4life ,06/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I sold my '04 Mazda 6 for my new '09 TSX. I have had it for a little over a week and I am absolutely in love with it! When I first saw it was coming out with all of these features I knew I had to have it, so it was really only new car I looked at and  boy I am not disappointed. I am getting great gas mileage for normal city driving and highway to work driving. The sound system and display is amazing with tons and tons of features you will love to play with. I can't wait to drive it every day and everyone I have shown can't say enough about how great it looks! Don't wait, Go get one today!","Very comfortable luxury interior, fun to drive, excellent gas mileage with lots of tech features to see how your driving. Paddle shifters, Bluetooth, awesome XM/stereo, tire pressure monitoring system, but best of all is USB connection to hook up  an iPod or flash drive and load up on the music!!",Only thing would be is to have gas door button in car instead of having to push it from the outside and dirty the car.
4.75,Switched from Muscle Car,Gmdavis5 ,06/14/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Switched from a 2005 Cadillac CTS-V with 400hp to the new 2009 Acura TSX due to increasing gas prices. The Acura is half the price and exceeds the Cadi performance. ,Love all the gadgetry and blue tooth. Car is extremely well built. I have manual transmission and shifting is great.

5,I travel a lot,Price Winters ,06/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I tried 15 different cars while waiting for the new TSX. My salesman told me it would be worth the wait. I am in sales and put on heavy miles. So far I have put over 1000 miles on it. I looked at all the 4 cyls because at 4.00 a gallon gas I thought I needed to move down. I am so happy I did it. This car has been nothing short of spectacular. The ride is solid, the power is fun and all you need in the city. I love the reworking of the Vtec it seems much more useable than the old model was. I am 6'2"" 285 lbs and am very comfortable. The stereo and navi in itself are exceeding my expectations, especially the nav traffic with the re routing feature, in Houston I have to use this a lot!","Tough to say, the ride is great, the handling and feel are probably my favorite as I drive over 500 miles a week. The stereo is so incredible and the navi is fantastic.","Fully power passenger front seat, non premium fuel (even though I am averaging 30 mpg so who is complaining).

Great handling! Smooth and quiet! Exceptional automobile! A good size trunk will work for weekend getaways with my wife and 2 girls! The design is ""slick and sassy""! I've owned a '95 Lexus ES300 and a 2002 Volvo S80. The Acura TSX beats both, in every way, by a mile!",The entire Technology Package!

5,What a car!,Larry  ,06/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Saw the TSX and was blown away. We travel a lot so handling/ride/comfort are important. Got it on a Mon., left for 1300+ mi. trip on Fri. What a great surprise bonus: first tank, 523 mi. w/51 mi left; varied speed 68-78, 35.5 MPG!! Mountain twisties w/paddles were great fun; handling is confident and sure-footed. Some aggressive driving/small town traffic brought second fill-up to 29.8. Trip home was combo of 2-lane w/small towns and interstate, 33.7 mpg. Did not expect NEAR this! The sound system/iPod convenience is marvelous. TSX is very comfortable; two 500+ days not tiring at all. Compare the 7 or so cars in this class- nearest comparably equipped car is priced $5K higher.

5,Nice Ride,Mike ,06/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just got the car and so far I am very pleased.  I turned in a Volvo S60 2.5T and got the TSX.  The TSX is so much more fun to drive, the 6 speed gearbox is smooth and the clutch is fantastic.  I read many semi negative reviews on the new TSX, I guess I am not a sport sedan enthusiast because the pick up and handling of this car IMO are great.  Overall I feel its a lot of car for the price.","Gadgets, Bluetooth, USB dock for iPod, 6 speed gearbox.",Maybe a turbo?

I traded in my '08 TSX because I loved the new styling of this car so much. The new '09 seems to drive even smoother than the '08, seems to handle better, and the audio system is definitely improved. I had no complaints about my '08, I just really liked the new design. I really like the backup camera in the new '09, I like the Acuralink feature on the new '09, and the interior and exterior design is definitely on par! I am very pleased with Acura's new design!","Backup camera, paddle shift, Acuralink, importable phone book option (you can import your phone book from your cell phone to use with Bluetooth) and interior and exterior styling.

I bought this car the day it came out, and I must say the car is worth every dollar!  This car is better than any Lexus, BMW, or Infiniti in its segment for a much less cost.

5,Fantastic car so far,doc067 ,05/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just bought this car last weekend, and so far I just love it and am having a blast driving it.  The exterior design is sharp and unique.  The interior is luxurious and relaxing.  I live in Chicago, which is not known for having the best roads in the world, but the ride is as smooth as you can expect over some very rough surfaces.  Despite what some reviewers are saying, I am very pleased with the handling of the car.  I also love all of the tech features, even in my base model. The driver's seat memory has been especially useful. It seems that Acura thought of absolutely everything in this car. And you know it's gonna be reliable. In this price range, I don't see how you could do better.","Luxury interior with comfortable seating, excellent gas mileage, fun to drive, many standard tech features, plenty of power, fantastic stereo system even in base model, looks great.",None so far

Test drove the TL and the TSX is so much more fun!  I got the manual and it is a chore for me to do the speed limit now.  The ride is so smooth.

5,Meet the New Boss!,dag14qb ,05/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The New TSX is nothing like the old one, it has sharp crisp lines, ground effects, beautiful wheels, and a very aggressive look. The first think I noticed is the Cockpit, with the new gauges, revamped center console, and the Navigation screen now indented into dash, there is no ""cabin"" feel to the car, it feels like a cockpit! The ride is amazing as well, if i drove it blindfolded i would swear it was a six cylinder. The 09 actually has 4 less hp than my old 05, yet it is faster due to more torque. I am completely enthralled by this vehicle, it is as dramatic a change as i have ever seen since i test drove the 04 TL when compared to the 03 TL. This is a beautiful car inside and out","Real time weather on navigation. Aesthetics (gauges, new center console). Ground effects. Wheels.

We thought we might get a deal on the 2008 model, but the new model was well worth the higher price! The ride is much more refined and less floaty, the steering lighter and more connected. It feels very nimble, just the way I want an urban commuter. The steering may be too light for sport sedan enthusiasts. The ride is still a little busy and noisy, which is typical of this makers products, but very acceptable, and lightyears ahead of my RDX. The finish and feature set are by far the best we saw any where near this price.","Handling, ride, features, fit and finish, gas mileage, intuitive controls, styling, price, USB memory stick interface for MP3.","Frequency selective shocks, contouring by the base of the windows so you can get a grip as you open the door, active noise cancellation to match the 4 cylinder."

It has great performance, stylish profile and fast pickup for the 201 hp. The interior is very sleek looking starting with the textured dash, display on dash easy to read, great sounding XM/radio.

Fits anyone (adjustable console, telescoping wheel, etc.) As a taller person (6'2"", 225) who has never owned a ""car"" I was surprised with the size and comfort of the TSX. My much smaller fiancee also feels as if the car fits her perfectly. In my opinon, Acura's luxury, reliability, and performance rivals all others at similar price points. The new body style of the TSX is very attractive. Interior is better overall than the TL. Only wish is that we had gotten the navi and that there were some woodgrain in the interior.","New body style, ride comfort, and gas efficency are great. Tech and features on the standard model are great. My fiancee loves the bluetooth integration. ","Woodgrain on the interior to give a more luxury feel. Minor, but side mirror turn signals should be extended where the driver can see."
