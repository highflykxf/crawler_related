4,Good Commuter Car,Alexmb ,11/14/2016,5,2,,,,5,5,3,4,,,"Over all really good car to go off to college with for what I paid. I bough it with 32,000 miles at the end of 2012 now end of 2016 around 60,000k. I have had no major issues with the car just I have done standard maintenance and only thing that I have replaced are headlights, tires and windshield wipers. Easy to control in tight spots. It still has the standard radio system which works well including the aux input and cd player. Really like having sunroof makes the car feel more open. Only complaint would be the clear coat which has started peeling.",,

4.5,Better than I had hoped,nolarobert ,06/17/2015,,,5,4,5,5,,3,5,5,4,I bought my Spectra SX new in July of 2009. It was priced to move since the brand new 2010 Forte was hitting the market. If I could have afforded to spend more I would have likely gone with the Honda Fit. Imagine my surprise 6 years later that my Spectra is still going strong with no major issues. It has proven to be an enjoyable car that is darned reliable. ,The 6-Disc CD/MP3 player has been awesome. I often take long trips & having this system has been fantastic. This car also cuts power to the headlights when I forget to turn them off which has saved me one multiple occasions. The controls are easy to read & manipulate. The A/C still blows cold on the hottest of days. Plenty of storage space & the center console bin has a 12-volt outlet for my phone charger. Cruise control is helpful on long trips. Peppy engine when you push it hard. Decent gas mileage if you drive in a sane manner. I can get 35 mpg highway if I don't lead foot it. Handles really well & rides well over all but roughest roads.,"Pinstripe came apart pretty quick. Clearcoat on door handles, KIA badges, rear bumper, rear spoiler, flaked off. So an improvement on paint finish is required. (Bumper & rear spoiler replaced under KIA warranty.) Alloy wheels are easy to scuff. Engine needs @ 10-15 more lb feet of torque for that initial 0-40 burst. A 6-speed automatic would get more out of this engine. Engine gets loud at high RPM. Adding telescoping ability to tilt wheel. Adding lumbar support for front seats. "

Contrary to other reviews I get excellent mileage on my KIA.I commute 55 miles one way to work, I have gotten anywhere from 30-38 mpg depending on my driving habits (if you know what I am saying ;)).My in town mpg is even better, I regularly get 40+ mpg and have had as high as 52mpg in town. I recalculated 3x because I couldn't believe it! It's a great car and with the sunroof & factory rear spoiler and on it, it looks sporty too!",">I love the manual transmission and mpg's.

2.25,Can't Stand This Car,soldiermusic ,05/03/2011,,,2,3,2,3,,3,1,2,2,"I have owned several cars in my driving years and I can look back fondly on various aspects of pretty much all of them.This car is an unfortunate exception.I absolutley loathe this car.It is very easy to oversteer and difficult to get back on track if you need to make a sudden swerve.The mileage is substandard.It gets about 26mpg highway.(My Sedona mini-van gets 22-23.)Please note I am not a leadfoot driver and I don't make hard accelerations.I'm pretty easy on my cars. Also, the driver's seat is worse that sitting on a wagon bench.At least a covered wagon doesn't have two bars right in line with my anatomy.And no, I'm not a very large or old person. ",It was cheap and has a decent warranty.,"It would be fine-ish if not used for long distance driving.
I have a 65 mile commute to work so 26mpg costs me alot of money compared to my old beat up Civic that still got 36 with an engine that was shot.
The seats are downright painful if seated for more than a short distance, so it would be great to see them overhaul the seat design.
I have not owned this car for long, so I can't say anything about reliability, but I can say I will be getting rid of this car ASAP!!!"

3.375,Totaled after one accident,chintanshah ,04/07/2011,,,3,3,2,3,,4,5,3,4,"This car was pretty great for when I had it. I bought it used last year. There were no major issues and it was an overall awesome car.Unfortunately, I got into an accident a couple of months ago where someone hit my front right wheel/door side head on. I was going about 40-50 and he had just pulled out, so I'd say about 15 or so. The damage didn't look too terrible except that the wheel and door were bent inward, the center dashboard popped out, and the passenger airbag broke the windshield (no glass was actually shattered).It turned out that the frame ended up being twisted inside along with the other problems I mentioned which totaled it out. My passenger and I were safe at least!","The aux port in the car was nice, no need to bring CDs. Overall, a really smooth ride.",Make the passenger airbag not break the windshield on deployment.

It's quite zippy for a grocery getter,even with it being an automatic transmission. Stereo system(hey, I'm 24, this is important stuff!) is great. I love that I've got an auxillary jack and I love the hidden charger in the middle console. It helps keep wires out of the way, and you can set your MP3 player or iPod/iPhone inside to keep it from sliding all over the car. The DOHC is a nice touch, but I wish the fuel economy could be a hair better. All in all, a nice roomy car that is incredibly affordable and great for the post college kid or the starting family.","Stereo, great standard brakes(sorry haters, take care of your car or don't go to a shady dealer), great acceleration and wonderfully roomy with all sorts of nooks and crannies.","Antilock brakes should be standard, I suppose this doesn't matter anymore though.

Good stuff: Peppy performance, great gas mileage; cool, intuitive dashboard controls; comfy seats (easy on my sciatica); solid warranty; roomy trunk; stylish, at least to my eyes.

5,Don't Underestimate the KIA Spectra,Tom R. ,11/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Having traded in a 2002 Hyundai Elantra for my KIA Spectra, I expected some close similarities in these Korean cousins. My expectations were pleasantly met in getting behind the wheel of this great little economy car.  For my Cash-for-Clunkers allowance for a 1999 Isuzu Trooper and my Hyundai trade-in, I drove away in my KIA Spectra EX for $10,000, including tax, title and registration. I have enjoyed the KIA Spectra experience from the moment I pulled off the dealer's lot. ","The KIA Spectra has a very quiet and smooth ride.  At about 1100 miles, I am getting about 21 mpg in totally in-city driving. The sound system is excellent, as is the air conditioning/heater-defroster.

Plenty of pep and super-quiet for the mondo freeway driving I do. Amazing fuel economy. Forget the EPA rating, I get 34mpg in mixed driving with the AC on most of the time! Picked it up for less than $11,000, with AC, CD and auto included. Lots of room, both front and back seats. Yes, the exterior and interior are simple, plain vanilla. I like that; pragmatism rules. And I'll agree that this is less solidly made than a Toyota. But for $5,000 less, well worth it! The lack of ABS, though, is shameful. All cars should have ABS standard these days; law should require it.

The peace of mind of having such a great warranty is priceless, and the added value of such a good MPG vehicle (getting 29 to 34) was an important factor. The controls are in easy reach, and the vehicle drives very comfortably. The interior is spacious and overall very pleasant to drive. I purchased the gold color with black and tan interior which gives off a mature but stylish feel to the vehicle.

The ""carpet"" is more like some sort of fuzzy cardboard, we'll see how the rest of the interior holds up over the next 3-4 years.

Before you laugh at the spoiler, I was cruising the I-10 at 105 mph & this engine was up to the task. At 85 mph & below the cabin noise was minimal.  I took some local back roads and the suspension was solid and the car felt glued to the road even as I took the curves at a goodly amount of speed.  The brakes bring the car to a quick stop with no spongy fade.  I look forward to taking my new Spectra on a long road trip to visit family in TN. The 700 mile journey will allow me to wring this car out & see if it holds up for the 11 hour drive. ","The SX trim has the 6-disc CD player w/ 6 speakers.  It sounds great & plays MP3 files.

The gas mileage has been around 28 MPG in the city, but I do expect that to increase as the car continues to break in. One of the major selling points for me was the incredible warranty and the roadside assistance.  The interior is a bit spartan but very well thought out.

I give this car straight 9s across the board... very happy with my purchase so far. I have even used the roadside service because I left my lights on and ran my battery dead. Called kia and they sent someone with no problems and limited info. They even called me back to make sure someone came to help.  Will buy a KIA again!,The price. Warranty. Great gas mileage.

And fuel economy is 20 percent better. I like how spacious the engine compartment is, in terms of accessibility to hoses, belts, battery, etcetera. These items are easy to see and inspect. And replacement, when necessary, should not be difficult. What I miss about the Focus is the softer seats. The Kia seats are are quite rigid. What I have a concern about is the cable actuated gas cap door. Cables and plastic latches fail in cold climates.

4.75,The new hot hatch,Robert E. Burton ,10/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I have personally been watching this car for 3 years.  I'm glad I waited to buy after the 2008 model year.  Kia has improved the styling tremendously by getting rid of a lot of the plastic skirting.  This car has a clean appearance.  The five spoke wheels are a plus over the old eight spoke alloys. This car is a hoot to drive, especially with the stick.  The engine has good low end torque.  Regardless of what you read or hear about this car, I say if you're interested go test drive one. Personally I see me driving this car for more than 100,000 miles.  ","What can I say? At $19,445.50 out the door (MI sales tax 6%) and add all of the standard features that you pay extra for with every other manufacturer, you can't go wrong; four wheel disc brakes, all power features, side curtain air-bags, good sound system, the list goes on.",I would say two things; better lighting and placement for the tachometer (it's hard to read sometimes) and add five lug wheels to this car like the Hyundai Elantra has.
