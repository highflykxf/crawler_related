5,Great,Cody Sigmon ,05/26/2016,5,,4,,,5,5,5,4,,,,,
5,Great compact car,Liwingard@gmail.com ,04/10/2016,5,5,2,,,5,5,5,2,,,"This car is so fast and reliable, great on gas, cheap to fix, beverages. Never breaks down",,
3,Very cool car but in the end UNIMPRESSIVE,Big Daddy WC ,07/29/2015,2,2,2,,,4,4,3,1,,,"The Good:  Huge interior.  I am 6'3"" and have plenty of headroom.  Legroom for the driver is average.  Front Seat passenger legroom is good.  You can lay the back seats down and haul a bunch.  Peppy engine and sound system is good.  Handles really well.  Toyota Camry engine so it is a reliable engine.The Bad:  - The seats.  Horrible.  Arm rest for the driver is way to low and slender.  Worthless.  The passenger arm rest is... wait, there is NO armrest.  Really??  Only 1 power adapter in the entire vehicle.  The center console is tiny, too low and pretty much useless.  The trim is cheap.  The weather stripping on the driver's side window lost its felt (or whatever it is) and the window bound up on the stripping when lowering it.  Car Max extended warranty would not cover.  Had to take a razor and cut it out, else spend $500 for a new door panel.  The ride is horrible.  You feel every bump.  If you are just using this for a trip here and there around town or for short commutes then it is ok.  I am using for a daily commute and it is abysmal.  There really is no intermittent wiper.  The intermittent setting can't be adjusted so it is just a lower low setting.  There is a horrible blind spot on the passenger side when backing out of parking spaces.  The fenders, hood, etc will dent if a leaf falls on it.  I barely leaned up against it and accidentally dented it.  Overall:  If you want a car for short commutes or a safe car for teen drivers then this is it.  Otherwise buy a Camry or Corolla.",,
4.875,2009 XB Fun even for an old guy,ocived ,09/18/2013,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this car for my daughter in Aug. of 08 after she moved to Colorado in '12 and needed a AWD I took it off her hands, since I'd need a car in a year or so. I love driving it. Very quick off the line and @4000 the VVT kicks in and it's on. For a 2.4 L. 4 cyl wagon it's a blast to drive. Toyota quality is all over this car. 83,000 + and no maintenance issues. One recall for coil packs R&R was it.","Styling, interior room, seat comfort, reliability, sound system, steering controls.",More wiper speeds. Better MPG Average is 27 Hwy.
5,"For me, it's perfect",garyxb ,07/18/2013,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought it off showroom floor 5 years ago and it has never given me even the tinyest problem.It averages 25 mpg in town and 32 on the hwy.I'm an old guy and performance is no longer nearly as important as ergonomics.It is the easiest car I have seen to get in and out of.The ride could be a tad smoother, but it is a minor enough complaint.

5,Happy,Happy ,11/13/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Ok so I owned a 2004 scion Xb and I bought it when it was brand new. It had 130,000 miles on it. Never had a problem not one with any part of the car. Earlier this year I got into an accident and my car was totaled. I decided to go with what I know and love. The Xb is a reliable car, great on gas, roomy.

4.5,Something different,Ardie ,05/11/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"I've  driven a Camry for the past 6 years; a nice but terribly boring car in every way.  I was looking for something safe as my oldest just turned 16, and the Camry had no side airbags, ABS or traction control.  The XB is fun to drive, very safe, better in the snow than the Camry, incredibly roomy, has a small turning radius, and a reasonably smooth ride.  I drive 30 miles each way to work, and I'm averaging 28 MPG at about 70 MPH.  On long trips I've exceeded 31 MPG.  The car is a like a Tardis, small on the outside but huge on the inside.  And I'm very confident in the safety features for my new driver. I like having a car you don't see everywhere.","Roominess, turning radius, ipod interface, mileage, unique styling, center-mounted instrument cluster, comfortable driving position, and safety.","Factory installed SUNROOF!!! You can't get one, and I really miss having one. I don't want to pay for an aftermarket sunroof.  And I'm in agreement with other reviewers, the armrest is ridiculous."
4,Can't complain,gman ,04/12/2010,,,3,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"This car is super reliable and practical.  That's why I bought it and it didn't disappoint there.  But I just don't find it very fun to drive, which is turning out to be more important to me than I thought.  Also the interior feels a bit cheap and I find the ride to be jarring over rough pavement.","Utility, gas mileage","None, it does what is advertised."
2.875,Less than stellar,unclealan ,03/30/2010,,,2,4,2,3,,3,3,3,3,"I used a true Klunker to get this Release Red, and I don't enjoy it as much as some. One tiny armrest, much too wide rear corners, quite hard to back up. Personally I am always hitting the gearshift knob when going to the gps/radio panel. Even the cupholder ticks me off (though admittedly I am a touchy guy). I do like the lights except for the single back-up one. Heated seats on the 'top' should have been part of the package ",,
4.75,Highly recommended,PeterUK ,02/16/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"My Black xB2 was amongst the first available in CA. It came with Alloy wheels, illuminated Door Sills and upgraded iPod stereo. I test drove it and fell in love with it. It's easy to live with, has been totally reliable, not even a rattle or squeak and has never needed to go back to the Dealer for anything!! I am a Cyclist and the xB will carry two full-size Roadbikes along with all the Gear. My Daughter and I took it on a 1,000 mile roadtrip to SF and back with 2 Bikes and all our luggage. 80+ mph all the way and it flies up and down the Hills of SF! The xB also carries 4 Adults comfortably, everyone compliments it on how much Legroom there is in the rear. ","Reliability, spirited performance. Roomy inside. Side Airbags. Easy to drive. Water Bottle holders in side Doors. Great sound system. Awesome value for money. ","Improve Driver's Arm rest and add one for the front Passenger. Pad the inside of small compartments to prevent items rattling such as Phone & Garage Remote etc. Gas mileage isn't as good as expected, I only average 23mpg on my short 2 mile commute, but 5 traffic lights don't help ;-)"
5,Almost wish for a longer commute!,Susan_in_AK ,02/14/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We looked long and hard for a suitable vehicle that my elderly mother can get it and out of, but can comfortably haul my son & 2 neighbors to school, all growing boys. We were driving past the Scion dealership and decided to check them out - we knew within the hour this vehicle was for us! Comfy, great handling, easy to get in & out of and so spacious! Handles fine in snow when it's not too deep. Happy with our purchase. Gas mileage is not as high as we hoped, but truth to tell the smooth ride & handling seems to encourage you to zip along. Absolutely love it!","I like zipping into any little parking spot we find. Great cargo capacity-just folded the back seats down and had room for a 42"" TV. A new desktop computer fit in back without even folding the seat! We added the overhead console for extra storage & colorful illuminated cupholders for fun.","Minor gripes: the passenger seat does need an armrest, and the rear window wiper doesn't seem to keep up well with snow & ice in the winter.

5,Best value on the market today,Brad ,02/14/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My fiance was looking for a good city car and we were interested in a low cost vehicle. I am a huge car nut, so I wanted something cool looking, reliable, and good fuel economy.We looked at everything with one determining factor being that I have to fit in it. For all of you tall guys 6'4+ this thing has tons of room for legs and plenty of headroom. The ride is very smooth, handling is great, acceleration still amazes me, it feels like a strong 6 cyl. Fuel economy is also incredible, we hit 28mpg avg with mix of city/hwy. Versatility is well thought out, this thing swallows as much as a truck bed could. All in all this is a best buy. I would highly recommend this car to anyone old or young.","reliability - not a single issue with this car,iPod/Aux connect, roomy, ride comfort, build quality, fuel mileage, exterior looks, headlights (produce tons of light), upgrade options, interior design ",The arm rest is pretty useless - I read this in the previous reviews and they are all correct.

4.875,"I CALL HIM ""MR"" XB",MR XB ,01/29/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased my white XB with 19 miles on it.  I added (dealer installed) a moonroof, scion security and lo-jack, fog lights, cargo cover.  From the outside it looks so small, but it is huge on the inside.  I love the performance and sometimes fool around with the semi-manual shift for fun.  I am very glad not to see a XB every where I turn.  The biggest selling point for me was the safety features you get for the low price.",I like the rear wiper.  I love the ipod hook up. I use that all the time.  Hatchback design instead of a door which opens sideways like the RAV4. I like the car's unique looks.,Make the arm rest bigger! Need an arm rest for the passenger.

4.625,I would buy another one!,Dr. Bones ,12/31/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I purchased a Release Series 6.0 and was glad I did.  Only 2,500 of these were produced.  This model comes with a Pioneer DVD Navigation system, interior LED accent lighting (can choose from four colors), a custom all-black grille, and a few other minor tweaks.   It has been a great vehicle so far and I enjoy driving it every day that I am on the road.  It is incredibly quiet, accelerates nicely, and handles beautifully.  It has been such a good vehicle for my family, that I am thinking about getting my wife one very soon.",It feels so spacious inside.  I can fold the seats down and have almost as much room as I had in my old pickup truck. It is surprisingly comfortable too for an inexpensive car.,"The Pioneer DVD Navigation system is inferior to a Garmin navigation system.  Still, I like the built-in bluetooh cell phone features which I use daily. I also was able to add satellite radio for under $100.  So it was worth it. Also, it needs driver and passenger arm rests!

4.75,Release 6.0 Only flaw is the NAV system,John N. ,12/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Ride is great, huge amount of interior room. Traction system is good in snow. Only issue is the NAV radio.  I am on my third and still can not get one in which all the feature actually work. iPod function takes 5 minutes to load ""VR dictionary"" each time.

4.625,LOVE IT!,sandy c ,11/13/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I love this Car.  I had a Focus and it drove terrible and only got about 27 mpg.  I researched on Edmunds and saw all the good comments so I decided to try the XB because it is like a suv but better on mileage and had a standard transmission; I just like manual.  It was everything I could have wanted, lots of airbags and my elderly father can get in and out easy.","Love the radio with i-pod connector, mpg is as good and even better than my previous car but this is larger.  I have already taken road trips with the back loaded with dog crates and bags.  I like that it is like an suv but without the extra cost and my insurance actually went DOWN!  WOW!","Seats are not very comfortable for long trips. Armrest is awkward.  I only use it on long trips because it gets in the way with shifting.

Told my husband that I wanted to test drive it before I ordered my Venza. Too bad for Venza that I did. Fell in love. Went in and ordered Classic Silver Metallic XB. Coolest thing I have driven. Put numerous accessories on it. Took them a wk to install them after they got it. I got leather seats, sport steering wheel, sport shift knob, door sill illumination, overhead console box, auto dimming mirror, upgraded audio system, tinted windows, floor and cargo mats, cargo cover. Sure I missed some and still not finished adding yet. Everyone loves it but not as much as me.It's a head turner.Mad in love.

1.625,I wish never bought it,Sam lathou ,09/23/2009,,,1,1,1,3,,1,1,4,1,"Ive had my 09 XB for over 7 months brand new. And since day one at over 40 M/H pulls to the right. Complained to Toyota but no action was taken. I dont like it at all, sheep car yet I paid over $19500 cash for it.

4.875,Great set of features for the price,nitido357 ,09/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have had this xB for about a month and a half and I'm still loving it like the first day. Many xB1 detractors decry the increased size, but I love it. The car is more comfortable than any mid-size car. It is also quite fuel efficient considering that you are still driving a box at 65-70 mph. Recently got 34 mpg on 2hr trip to OKC, quite hilly at times. My family of 5 fits quite easily on short and longish trips. The wife loves the cargo space, which is much better than the '07 Pacifica she drives around town.     ","Everything. For under 20k in dollars, this car gives you a lot. Seamless iPod integration is a plus. Stock Pioneer equipment is very nice. Safety feature set is excellent for the price.

4.625,Balance the car ,JBE ,09/07/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love the XB but it needs some visual balance. First the single backup light needs a partner to balance the bumper. Also, annoying is the fact only one armrest is provided but at least it is for the driver. And one final"" want"" for my XB  would be dual pipes to really make a power statement.

I did my research and test drove many compact cars that was in the same price range. Nothing seemed to compare to the XB. When I work from Home my wife steals it from me.

The Scion has proven after three weeks of ownership a bit of a good move on my part.  Economy is great, roomy, and fun to drive.  The 2.4 engine make the Scion get and go, economy of the car is really see at the low speeds, the automatic trans could use an additional gear, keeping the RPMs around 1.8k when on the highway and would make the Scion that much more economic for highway use, but with a tight engine I got 315 miles on the first out of town trip.

Maybe if the side mirrors weren't so big, they leave blind spots. Also I need to have the seat way forward so now window controls are hard to find and door arm rest too low.

Practical and fun to drive - 2.4L has plenty of pep. Interior is sparse but functional.  I like the 2008+ body style - I receive a lot of compliments and there is plenty of room inside.  I don't find the center mount gauges distracting and the steering wheel position is just fine.  I find it interesting that ""professional"" reviewers generally knock the car yet actual owners love it.

I, HONESTLY, could use more leg room and Im only 5'9"". I find it difficult to get comfortable. The interior of my 05 Corolla has more width between the center console and the drivers door. Sort of weird considering how big the rest of the interior is. It has nice pick up and handling.  Ive done two checks on the mileage thus far. One all around and one this past weekend for a highway trip of about 200 miles one way, 400 total. Mileage was much less that what I expected.  All around was about 22 and Highway was only 24! (actually 23.5) Pretty bad if you ask me. ","Nice stereo, head room, cargo space, handling, pick up, style and looks...really nice to look at, reliability, Ipod hook up, cool interior design. ","Armrests for adults not children, mileage, better lighting in interior, mileage, leg room, Road noise, Mileage, Roof noise when it rains...way too loud, Arms rests for passenger too, Stand alone clock, Oh....and better mileage.

This edition comes with a built in navigation system that is great (equal to my Garmin), bluetooth, etc. and is a joy to drive.

Each time I take it out to drive I like it a little bit more and I loved it when I bought it.  The xB isn't the fastest, sportiest, or most luxurious car I've owned but it's pretty fun to drive, it handles well, and it has a comfortable ride whether I've been on road trips or just cruising around town.  It's a nice balance in pretty much all fronts, which is surprising for a car this cheap.  Also, the folks at Scion are a pleasure to deal with.  I've also noticed that a lot of people complain about the fuel economy of the xB but I've found that I've gotten between 28 to 33 mph, which isn't that bad. ","Balance of performance and comfort, interior roominess, amount of features for price, customizability, the way it feels like you're in a small SUV but not wrecking the environment.

I was looking at the Honda CRV, but at 10K more I just couldn't justify the cost.  Granted the CRV is a more plush car, functionally they are very similar.  I wish the XB had an extra 12v outlet, but other than that it's exceeded my expectations.  After 1 week of driving we are averaging 25.7mpg, MUCH better than I expected.  I didn't get many of the extras (unlike my Son-in-Laws car) but I did get the rear cargo deck.  Only  one other thing I'd be critical of is the Pioneer Radio.  It has an SSR feature that I can't quite get right?

Grown-ups can sit back there - no other vehicle offered this.  I had a 1993 Toyota Pickup with the I4 2.4L engine and loved it - this engine has the juice when you need it!  I added the cold air intake for a little more HP - at the cost of a few MPG's.  We're seeing 28MPGs, but with 128+ FT^3 interior space, that's actually pretty amazing.  It is a bit heavy and catches a lot of wind, but its meant more for utility, not speed.

I am over 6 feet tall and about 300 lbs, and am comfortable in the front or back seats. Car is quick and nimble to drive, but a lot of road feel. Could get better, mileage, only about 28 ave. Most disappointed after driving less than 1,000 miles (less than 2 weeks) the check engine light came on. Took it to a dealer who ""fixed"" it and 4 days later had the same problem. Now they are replacing the transmission. Sure, it's under warranty, but that does nothing for my time, lost work, and aggravation. Sadly disappointed at Toyota quality. Is in the shop more than my driveway.","MP3 and Ipod docking, headrests, interior room, easy fold down seats, good cargo room with seats down. Good pick-up for highway merge.

Not as high as an SUV, (back in the day I drove a Jeep Cherokee) but high enough to provide better sight lines on the road.  The interior feels very roomy, and the seats are the most comfortable of all the cars I tried before purchasing the XB. The automatic transmission works well for downshifting when roads are snowy / ice covered. Could not ask for more at this price.

It's quick, agile, and very responsive. Even with the A/C on, I can merge onto the expressway with no problem. The ride is comfortable, although my wife prefers the cushier seats in her Lexus.

Next day we bought it. We love the handling of the car, the roominess inside, and the sound system is terrific. The seats are quite comfortable for us.

It is no sports car, but it is sporty and  fun to drive. I have music gear I haul around frequently, so it's a great ""gigging"" car. My two kids dig it as well. I like the automatic, it shifts just when I think it should and compliments the torquey 2.4 L well.

4,A Fun Car/SUV,Greg ,06/12/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,4,3,3,5,"Well, I traded in my 4.7L Toyota Tundra for the Scion Xb earlier this week.  I went from an average of 14.7 ml/gal to 26 ml/gal. Although the Xb is small on the road, it has a big roomy interior.  Very good pick-up and go power, a little bit bumpy ride but is tolerable, a little road noise but again is tolerable.  The Xb is fun to take exit ramps fast, handling curves with ease, comparable to go-cart handling, little body roll.  My family loves the interior and the extra leg room in the back, and they think its a cool car over all.  I did test drive many cars such as Chevy HHR, Subaru impreza & forester, Ford escape, focus, fusion, the Scion Xb won hands down.","Great safety features:  ABS, VSC, airbags.  Good gas mileage and I expect that to improve.  Cool looks ext/interior.  Roomy inside, handling, my dealership offers a Life Time Warranty on the powertrain!!!","At night the dashboard on the drivers side is completely dark, you almost have to fumble around to find a switch or button.  The radio display is grainy, should have a higher matrix.  These are small complaints, it would not stop me from buying the car.  Good job Scion!"
5,Love my XB,kelmack ,06/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have been driving a suburban since 2001.  I recently totaled the vehicle and had to purchase something new.  I was looking for something with good gas mileage, smaller, not too small, lots of leg room and could still haul stuff in the back if need be.  The Scion XB was the perfect solution.  I absolutely love this vehicle and look forward to driving it.  I haven't found anything negative about it.  I added the spoiler, and leather.  It's a great car!",,
5,Terrific Vehicle for the Money,Perry ,06/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased this vehicle after extended research on comparable vehicles; there really is no other that offers this kind of space/efficiency for the price.  On the first test drive I was smitten with the overall feel and build quality and decided to purchase then (of course no mention of this to the salesman).  The car handles just like a small car, the power is much better than expected and the noise levels during driving are very low.  It feels as though this is a more expensive car than the sticker indicates and that itself is very impressive.  The manual transmission is silky smooth and engagement of the gears is quite accurate with a solid high quality feel.  Sound system is great, buy it!","Clutch/Shifter Silky smooth engine All the safety features (stab control, curtain airbags, anti-lock brakes) Build quality Seats Space Interior textiles and plastics",Ugly wheel covers No seat back pockets Sun visors too small No front window tint (back windows are tinted) 
5,A whole lotta car for the bucks...,Great family car! ,06/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Owned this little dickens nearly 2 weeks..We love it!Mpg is around 24-26 in a 50-50 mix..It likes to scoot. We love the deep burgundy color. Hope to add wheels and spoiler at a later date.Traded a Highlander with 135,000 miles. Hope the Scion is nearly as good to us..This is affordable and fun..Give it a shot! Big Camry motor.",Big Camry motor. Not bad mpg. You can add stuff as you get the money. Super roomy.,Bigger arm rest. Can't complain other than that..
4.625,"New to me, but I like it",Bruce Lampley ,06/02/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"We now have 250 miles on our xB(ox). Things I like include the stying, performance. I like the cruise control. Other cars I've driven will downshift and floor the gas if you hit the break and then resume cruise. Not this Toyota system. Resume = smooth return to previous speed.  Things I don't like. I'm short (5'7"") and hit my knees on the steering column getting in and out. Would it have broken the bank to put a second arm rest for the front passenger? Would prefer an analog speedo rather than digital. ",Styling. Power. Mileage. Cruise control. Handling. Audio system (Base Pioneer system).,"Second arm rest on front passenger seat. Better/more color choices. Little interior quirks, like the headrests on the back seats hit the back of the front seat when you put the back seats down (if the front seats are back). The front seat headrests poorly placed for my wife, push her head forward"
5,Old Folks Car,Ed McCormack ,05/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am 66 and 6'4"" 280# and I was looking for a suv that I could fit in and get good gas mileage.  My Scion xb 09 is great.  Plenty of room and more pep than I ever thought it could have.  Don't hesitate and don't listen to your grandchildren when they say ""box""; they change their minds when the see it.  If you are in Houston call Beth at Fred Haas Toyota in Spring; when my 95 Tahoe quit on the day we were to pick up our new xb she drove 80 miles to pick us up.  Service beyond the call.  Hard to find these days.  We are not related or anything. Ed","Room ( front and back ) Power ( hard to believe the pick up ). Interior ( no complaints ). It's ""COOL"", as the grand-kids say.",Can't find a bug deflector any place.  Tried Weather Tech and they didn't have one nor would they answer any of my e- mails about the bug deflector.  Their floor and cargo liners fit perfect and I was disappointed that they were not on line with the new vehicle.
