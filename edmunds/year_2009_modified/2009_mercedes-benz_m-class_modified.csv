4,Great SUV,David ,12/05/2015,5,4,5,,,4,5,4,5,,,"Overall this is an excellent SUV. It's got peppy acceleration, good brakes, great looks, and is very comfortable. The interior is super nice. I love the iPhone integration, backup camera, and peace of mind knowing I have airbags everywhere. This SUV has FANTASTIC traction. It can be raining and I can pull out on an uphill incline and floor it- this thing just grabs and go's! This gives me peace of mind when my wife drives it versus our car when the weather is bad.With all that being said- it's a Mercedes. Premium fuel, expensive synthetic oil changes, and all that good stuff. Its not too bad because honestly all cars are expensive if you go to a dealer. Find a good Indy mechanic good with euro cars and you'll be fine! I had a Timing chain replaced at 80,000 miles- was told it may have needed this because perhaps the previous owner may not have changed there oil like he should have.",,

What does this mean; more $$There are probably more to come; i may find out or i may wave the white flag and try to get rid of it.I will put it to you the best way i can; i have owned a variety of diesels for over a decade including foreign diesel powered vehicles. Pass on this one; this has been a money pit compared to the 10 diesels i have owned. I have only owned this vehicle for 2 years and look how much i have spent; this is a fun vehicle to drive and has every bell and whistle; but you will pay to have the luxurious Mercedes-Benz named vehicle.,,

3,Worst reliability of any vehicle I have ever owned,Manfred Schropp ,09/15/2015,2,3,4,,,1,5,4,5,,,"The engineers who designed the vehicle did a good job. It is spacious, comfortable, quiet, has a fantastic range on long distance drives - up to 700 miles on one tank 95 liters / 26.5 US gallons. I still love driving it after almost 7 years. You can drive 800 miles in one stretch and exit the car still feeling fresh. The strong torque of the Diesel engine with up to more than 30 mpg, the transmission working seamlessly in the background, the comfortable ride, the quietness of the cabin, the excellent seats make this a wonderful vehicle.BUT THE RELIABILITY IS TERRIBLE! This is hands down the worst vehicle I have ever owned in terms of frequency and cost of repair (see below), and these cars include 2 Jeep Cherokees when they were still made by AMC. While my local dealer is very very good, Mercedes Benz of USA and the folks in Stuttgart were of no help whatsoever. Verbatim from a MBofUSA representative: ""Sorry, there is nothing we can do for you. We suggest you negotiate a real good deal with your local dealer when you buy your next Mercedes.""Repairs & Parts replaced on my 2009 Mercedes ML-320 Bluetec in 6 years & 10 months and 73,696 miles light duty use.01. Factory recall: Tail lamps, rear lights, power lift gate module replaced 9cost not known) at 5,176 miles02. Warranty work: Noise from front end; replace right front wheel bearing at 27,670 miles03.

Warranty work: Left rear door lock assembly replaced at 42,541 miles07. Repair NOT covered by warranty: replaced auxilliary heater in AdBlue tank diagnosed at 49,671 although it is part of the emissions control system but NOT covered by MB emissions control warranty (read the small print); paid out of some slush fund after my vociferous complaints to MBofUSA; cost estimate almost $2,200.-; fixed problem at 50,843 miles08. Repair: Front passenger door lock assembly (same broken part as above, different door) $833.99 after 15% dealer courtesy discount at 53,277 miles; MBofUSA refuses any consideration.09. Repair: Noise from engine department - loose NOX sensor - tightened - no charge at 56,633 miles10. Repair: Replace 2nd NOX sensor and EGR temperature sensor and air cleaner turbo seal at 60,028 miles; this NOX sensor lasted 24,162 miles; cost of repair $1,350.9211. Repair Turbocharger intake shut-off motor, seals, gaskets, pipes (almost left me stranded) at 66,241 miles; cost $1,675.8912. Repair: Bad Glow Plug Control Module at 68,9921 miles; cost $503.6413. Repair: Oil leak in front engine area. Turbo Pipe Gree O-Ring Seal and seal on oil breather assembly black o-ring seal; oil squirted on V-belt; replaced free of charge by dealer as it was possibly related to repair #11 not performed 100%; dealer otherwise very good and VERY HONEST. Same mileage as Repair #12 done at same time.14. Replace 3 engine mounts / support struts. They were leaking fluids; at 73,696 miles; $1,774.3815. Replace temperature sensor upstream of turbo at 73,696 miles (as in #14); cost 737.98Estimated cost of warranty repairs $5,000+; repairs paid by owner $6,876.80 (does NOT include windshield replacement caused by stone from passing truck or self inflicted body damage); additional regular maintenance cost incl. tire replacement $8,391.98 (does NOT include registration, SMOG check, insurance, fuel); total estimated cost for all repairs, incl. warranty work, and regular maintenance ~ $20,268.78; Days in service 2491; average number of days between repairs (does not include regular maintenance trips) 166; average number of miles between repairs 4,913.UPDATE 1: The car now has 80,750 miles on it and nothing has broken since my original review. That is about 7,000 miles without something breaking, although I did have a brief scare at about 76,000 miles when the car lost power on a long uphill portion on the freeway and slowed down to about 35 mph. I managed to pull off the road [slow trucks were using the emergency lane], turned off the car, and after about 5 minutes restarted it. It has been running fine ever since. A visit to the dealer did not show any recorded error code. About 30 miles earlier I had added fuel when the tank was still half full. Maybe the fuel was dirty and caused a momentary clogging. I still love the design and how it drives very much, it is just the reliability that I hate. But I may have gotten a particularly bad one-off example.UPDATE 2: At 80,915 m replaced defective 2 front air suspension struts & air compressor & 4 new tires as a result, new turbo inlet pipe seals, new transfer case input shaft seal, incl. C-Service $7,303. 15 unscheduled stops so far not counting light bulbs. Repl. backup camera (warranty), est. $2,400 incl. module.",,

3.375,Does anyone else notice these issues?,mbfan9 ,07/02/2015,,,5,4,2,2,,4,4,3,3,"I own 3 Mercedes Benz's. A 2006 S500 with 120,000 miles, a CLK550 with 50,000 miles and the 2009 ML350 with 53,000 miles.
Out of these 3, the first 2 are manufactured in Germany. The ML is made here in the USA.
The first 2 get 24-27 mpg on a long trip. The ML350 gets around 20mpg.
Heres the issues.
The ML is not made as well as the other 2. It has had rear hatch issues, sunroof issues (just had to replace the switch on the sunroof, cost almost $1,000) and multiple other very minor issues that always seem to cost between $500 and $1000.
The cover of the drivers rear view mirror popped off. Everything functioned, but the cover would sometimes pop off in the car wash. Cost to repair $630.",,"Engineering design is suspect. Why would MB put a $10 sunroof switch into an overhead panel so that when the switch fails the repair costs over $1000. They had to replace the entire panel, lights and all. That's just inexcusable engineering.
It seems to me that MB is following the 'Gilette' strategy. Reduce costs of production by co-joining multiple functions, then charge an arm and leg for the 'razor blades' at the service level. By the way, P&G which owns Gilette is finding out the hard way that sales are plummeting. I guess the consumer has other options that to pay the exhorbitant prices. I love my other MB's. This ML seems like a very poor comparison"

I never imagined myself driving a crossover. Until now. The wow factor is instant when you see this SUV. Inside and out it is just fantastic. Faster than my old V8 with better MPG's and no problem towing our 22 foot boat. I've owned a Hummer H2 in the past and I'll be the first to admit that his Mercedes is an off-road legend in hiding!

3.25,Problems,merc5 ,01/30/2012,,,4,4,2,1,,4,4,3,4,I have had this vehicle for 2 years and 5 months. Service has just finished replacing all of the front end bushings without an apparent cause for wear. 29522 miles of almost all highway miles and good roads. No off roading.After one year my gas gauge started malfunctioning. Service had to drop the tank and replace one gauge. I had a 2000ML with various problems including the same gauge issue. Nine years later and still issues that should never have happened. Mercedes service has been very good but none of these things should happen. Integrity is lacking. Too high a price to spend the time in service for things that should not fail so quickly. Transmission could shift a lot smoother.,Style and solid feel when driving.,Better quality control of parts suppliers. Transmission shifts ruff at times from 1st to 2nd particular from a quick slow down to a quick acceleration.

3.75,Very finicky car,victor ,07/02/2010,,,4,4,1,3,,5,5,4,4,"Like many German cars, this has its quirks. The navigation is tough to get used to, but that's not what's most curious about this car: at elevation about 10,000 feet, the nav shuts off! It displays a warning and becomes inoperable. Mercedes says it affects so few people that they won't fix it. So if you drive in the mountains a lot (we live in Colorado) and want to use this car in high elevations, keep this in mind.  As importantly, keep in mind that Mercedes refuses to spend the time reprogramming the nav systems. Maybe they outsourced that part to Japan...","Big V8 engine has plenty of power, great brakes, comfortable ride, decent sex appeal.",Fixing the quirks in the navigation...it's even more unacceptable considering the price tag on this car.

Little did we know that it is not designed for tall or larger people.  I weigh 210lbs and 5'11"" tall so I am not big.  It is very uncomfortable to come in and out of the driver's seat. With the seat back, my kid does not have leg room from his car seat.  I move the seat forward and have to drive uncomfortably.  The rear entertainment is mounted very poorly in the back that my 4 year old has bumped his head hard 3-4 times.  I do not recommend it for family of 4 with kids.  With the 2 car seats, it is very difficult to seat 5.  THe fuel economy is averaging around 24mpg which is not bad. Diesel is sufficient for daily drive.","Bluetec,IPOD, HD Radio, and controls.

5,Best ML Yet,Hank ,11/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5," We bought this to replace the 1998 ML320 we had for eleven years. The old one was great and gave outstanding reliability, but it was time to replace. This ML320 BlueTec is a great replacement and it has lived up to it's advertising. Great mileage and comfort with all the gadgets you would want. Very solid feel on the road with plenty of room for storage. We have other diesels in the family and this is one of the best. It is quiet and soot free with good mileage for the weight of the vehicle. On the road you don't even know it's a diesel. Fantastic improvement over the older diesels.",Great diesel engine Solid handling on the road. Very comfortable in all conditions.

First, this car is very fun to drive and has great handling and performance. The rear seats are another story. The way the back doors are shaped makes you trip almost every time you get out of the back. They contour around the wheel inserts. Making for a very uncomfortable entry/exit. Just look at a side view of the car and you'll see how the back doors are shaped. It has a very well made interior and exterior. The navigation system is pretty confusing, though.

The handling on the 2006  was  great and fun to drive, the 2009 doesnt have steering with as much feel, it feels more like a bus. No feedback.  I think the steering wheel is also bigger in this year but not sure. THe fake leather  seats  do not compare to the  comfort of the leather seats i had  previously.

I had to make one stop to the dealer to date and that was for a recall notice I receive to fix some hydraulic problem and tail light seal. The truck was drop off in the morning and i picked it up about three hours later. some noticeable comments: 1) there is a click noise in the cold when you first start the car. 2) With the window down a loud noise is heard when switching from park to drive or reverse. The dealer said this is normal and is due to the large solonoid. 3) The radio went off but no display came on. The radio came back on after the vichele was turn off and back again.

This MB beat my previous luxury Japanese SUV hands down, in terms of ride, braking, offroad (something the previous SUV just couldn't handle)and mileage. It sure cost more but the extra cost is worth it. Mileage is very good and one can't tell that it's a diesel engine. Using the cruise control significantly enhances mileage on highways.

Gas mileage is as bad as the Rover.","Handling, feel, braking, transmission, paddle shifters, power lift-gate, sound system, blue-tooth, driving position, styling, 19"" rims, in-cabin silence","Re-locate cruise control stalk, add a right-of-steering-wheel stalk for wipers (current left stalk has turn signal, front/rear wipers and washers - too much for one stalk), remove P-R-N-D stalk and allow paddle shifters to select these, gas cap is too touchy and can set off check engine light"
