1,Heartache with Chrysler,Emile Gauvin ,04/01/2016,1,4,4,,,1,2,3,4,,,"I had an Intrepid which required a fair amount of front end suspension parts and accepted this because of the design of the car (front-end heavy and so on)  when we purchased the Compass one thing that returned was front end part issues and lots of them, started at 20,000 kilometers.  Because front-end issues can cause havoc with tires and steering in general, I like to have this in top shape, but it is a never-ending issue every time it goes in for regular service.  It still goes on today with the most recent lower control arms being replaced for the second time before 100,000 kilometers.  At 25,000 kilometers we started having the sun roof leak into the car.  Being told that the drain lines in the roof needed cleaning periodically seemed a problem because you really don't know when this can happen.  You tube had ways that people gave up with Chrysler and came up with their own solution although extensive it dealt with a lot of modifications to the drain line and this meant taking parts of the interior off.  Then, the front driver's side pan just in front and the back would fill with water - up to 2 inches of water, no rhyme or reason, cleaned this out several times before the dealership finally gave up on the issue of the drain lines and found a body molding without the proper seal in place.  The drain lines are still an issue but instead of paying $126 to have these blown out with compressed air, I do it myself. The last thing to go wrong is the K frame when the lower control arms were being replaced.  The place where I have my maintenance done on the Jeep now has a mechanic that used to work for a Chrysler dealership and alerted me to the fact that the K frame is rotting and that I seek out the dealership warranty, should there be one.  Right now I'm staring at $500 getting it done myself or $900 through the dealership - not even 100,000 K on the vehicle!The only good thing I have to say about the Jeep is in the snow, you cannot beat it, it is a tank with Blizzaks for tires.  However, when we get a wet snow/rain and it freezes, the doors will not latch after opening, major problem since the only way to rectify this issue is to leave the vehicle heat-up, with it not locked (not good!)So, we are getting rid of the Jeep soon.  All of the review of this and also the fact that there is always some sort of hassle with Chrysler has made the decision of what to purchase next, which does not include any type of Chrylser product what-so-ever!",,

2.75,2009 Jeep Compass Crysler,marthah ,06/26/2012,,,3,4,2,1,,2,4,3,3,after 150 000k; my vehicle kept stalling when it overheated; brought it Crysler service 4x; they could never fix the problem; I do not like it either that I couldn't check my transmission oil; had to bring it to the shop every time; I rate this vehicle close to a 1' I had changed oil every 5000 k; kept it well serviced; it still didn't do the job it should have; I had bought other vehicles from Chrysler; and this is a lemon; I have spoken to to a lot of people who own them and they too have the same problem.They are good for awhile; some go after 10 000 k; motor stopping others like mine go after 100 000.It is too bad; and I did like Chrysler.,interior,motor and transmission and brakes

4.5,Great Crossover,Jessy ,07/01/2010,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"I'm confused with why the ""pros"" don't like the Compass.  It's a great crossover utility vehicle with plenty of room for those who don't need a large SUV, but are similarly disinterested in using a shoe horn to get in and out of an automobile.  The fuel economy on my Compass has been mediocre at best, but the vehicle is fun to drive and I'm impressed by the safety features.  I love my Jeep!  ","Superior sound system, lifetime power train warranty, 115v outlet, plenty of storage space, and very comfortable seating.  Assembled in Illinois.  The best feature:  it's a Jeep!",Why is there no compass in the Compass?  Improve the fuel economy and make power windows/locks standard like nearly every other manufacturer.

4.625,"Fun, Practical, Unique styling",Herky ,10/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"I wanted to downsize from my 2003 Chevy Blazer 4x4 and found an incredible deal at one of the Chrysler dealerships that was losing its franchise. I liked the funky, crossover design and decided to test drive it on a whim. More than 4 months later I still enjoy this vehicle as much as the day I took that test drive. So far, this is a great little car. My gas mileage is around 28 and I've got the automatic tranny. The interior is very user friendly, and the seats are firm and comfortable. This thing is agile; handling is great. Engine performance is more than adequate. Overall, I'm very impressed with this Compass. Also, I get a lot of compliments on this vehicle.

4.625,Possible Problems?,Possible problems? ,10/05/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Just bought my new 2009 Jeep Compass with touch screen radio 3 days ago.  Overall this vehicle is wonderful with some exceptions.  The touch screen radio is not working! All other touch screen components are fine but radio is very temperamental. Compartments in console are very tiny and are too small to really put anything in them. Cup holders a bit hard to get at however, love the optical interior improvements from the 2007 compass that I rented last year, but is this electrical problem a sign of things to come? ","Smooth ride, awesome on gas (same as my Honda Civic!) sleek exterior design, low engine noise, feels like a luxury car yet drop down tailgate speakers are perfect for the drive in!","make cup holders more easily accessible for driver.  Rather than have multiple small compartments on console, suggest having more useful ones or none at all as very hard to clean in small places."

4.875,Great Deal,C. Mays ,10/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I Shopped until I Dropped.  I found problems relating to all SUV's and what sold me on the Jeep Compass was the price and the lifetime powertrain limited warranty.  MSRP: $19,450.00 Minus: $4500 cash for clunkers Minus: $3500 Chrysler rebate. Minus: $2500 cash back from my dealer.  A very nice SUV for around $10,000.00 that rides well, easy to park and is fun to drive. ","Easy auto to maintain, people comments on the looks, fun to drive.  The headroom is fantastic.  Service from the dealer is painless.","A wider body for more room.  Tires stick out further than the body so mud flaps are a must.  Poor width room with the high center console in which many autos have.  Every time you open the main console, the little cell phone storage unit flips open.  Still needs improvement on noise control"

3,So disappointed,Riggadeaux ,08/20/2009,,,1,5,3,3,,4,1,3,4,"We tried to buy a Patriot during cash for clunkers but couldn't find one with 4wd anywhere in the country so got the Compass instead.  BIG mistake!  I have to put a cushion on the seat because it is too narrow for my wide load and the seat belt digs into my right thigh when driving.  The rear-view mirror gives a tiny view through the small back window but worst of all, I can't change lanes because the high seat backs in the back row completely block my view of the next lane.  Dangerous!  Handling is fine, looks are great, and fuel is okay.  I'm getting about 24 on mostly highway.  I just don't think I can stand the discomfort so I'm considering selling or trading this in now.","Looks good, has great cup holders.",Improve the view to eliminate blind spots.

4.875,What a fun car!,Ivan ,07/24/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased this car after driving an Acura MDX for 4 years.  At first I was concerned about the big change going from a higher end SUV to a much smaller (and cheaper) crossover.  However, I just love the way this car drives. Because the car is so much lighter than my old SUV, the smaller motor fits the vehicle just fine.  The CVT works well.  I'm still breaking the motor in, but am averaging around 27mpg.  The uconnect DVD navigation with hard drive and satellite radio is really nice.  It took a little while to get used to the Rallye wheels, but now I really like them. Overall, I'm very happy with this car.","DVD navigation system, Rallye styling, comfortable ride, great handling, gas mileage.",Offer power seats.  Improve the interior quality just a bit more.

5,OUTSTANDING Built Vehicle,Mike Klementovich ,07/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I never thought I would buy American again after a wonderful run with my 95' Toyota Corolla with over 200,000 on it and still running strong...i needed a stronger motor to pull a motorcycle trailer and I test drove a X-3 BMW and a honda C-RV and this Compass blew them both away.  The most outstanding thing about this vehicle is the way it handles...IT handles like a sports car!!!!!!!!!!  No Kidding.  Tight package.  Comfortable seats...and an EXTREMELY quiet ride even at 70-80mph!!!!!

4.75,Great Buy,Bones ,06/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"This is a great small SUV. I have repeatedly driven a 07 Ford Escape, and a 06 Toyota Highlander and the Compass is a lot more fun to drive. It's not exceptionally quick or powerful, my previous vehicle was a Dodge Ram with a 5.7L Hemi, but the car-like handling makes up for it. Also, the fuel efficiency seems to be better than the 25mpg stated. I have worked it out to be roughly 30mpg city and 40mpg highway. It felt a little sluggish when I first started driving it, but when I became more familiar with the CVT nuances, I feel the performance has increased. The interior is more than competent and rather comfortable, even considering my 6'6"" frame. Also, the entertainment options are a plus.",Sleek design Boston Stereo System Sirius Satellite Radio 150V Plug-in,"The CVT seems slightly off. The point of the CVT is to optimize the RPMs at certain speeds but I find that sometimes I can achieve lower a RPM at the same speed by using the ""Auto-Stick"" electronic control. However, the CVT most often does it job properly. It just takes a little getting used to."

4.75,60 day review,Zeferam_Cockran ,05/18/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"As follows are the assessments after 60 days for Compass sport 5spd 4x4 north: Average fuel mileage ( without Air cond running ) 28mpg, 80% highway at 74mph, 20% city. 5 speed tranny good but requires work for reverse with clutch. Engine good and quiet, no rattles or noises, no false starts. No faults detected, interior build better than other models such as 08 Liberty. Great ride handling, good sound insulation. Tested 4x4 on muddy access trail, no undercarriage hits, good ground clearance for model. All in all a very good purchase for the dollar and only real 4x4 offered with 5spd in this price range. Easy to reach zones for cleaning since my co-pilots are my pets.

Complaints lodged against the 08 Compass have been rectified in 09:  the interior has been redesigned and looks great, the additional noise dampening makes the vehicle ride quietly and the transmission is smooth. This thing is fun to drive and has a lot of pickup for a 4 cyl. engine. I was looking for a 6 cyl. vehicle but this one won me over after a test drive. Fuel economy is good and the price is fantastic. I personally love the look of the vehicle-as long as it is red, blue or orange-the other colors make the vehicle look long (my opinion). I give it a solid 9-test drive one!","115 outlet in the center console, ride height, storage space, interior is easy to clean and maintain",Offer a 6 cyl. engine.
