1,Very Reliable Car!!!,John Luten ,07/16/2016,4,3,2,,,4,2,1,2,,,The car is very low mileage and I have gotten the car serviced on a regular bases.  Great Michelin tires.,,

5,You can't do better!,ANN Weiss ,07/04/2016,5,4,4,,,,5,5,4,,,This car has been very dependable. Many people tell me that it still looks brand new. The interior looks new too. I have not had to do any engine repairs. I do have the oil changes done every 5000 miles and rotate the tires every 6000 miles. A body shop worker told me that in over 20 years he has only seen damage from a collision to the inside of a Camry once. It also retains its value well. I plan on buying another Camry for my next car.,,

3,The Good Bad and Ugly,Judy Limburg ,06/14/2016,3,4,4,,,,4,4,5,,,"We bought our 2009 Toyota Camry XLE in the winter of 2012 with 30,000 miles on it.   We now have 77,500 miles on it.   We are a bit disappointed at the amount of work we've had to do on it . . . we had to have the fuel pump replaced.    The struts were next.   New tires and, if memory serves me, a new battery as well.   And now the ABS module is on the fritz.    Fortunately, the first two repairs were under warranty.   But, of course, as soon as our warranty runs out, we have the MAJOR expense of the ABS module to deal with.   It's at the dealership now being diagnosed.   We are anticipating a repair cost of $2000 or so.   Not fun.   The good - the car is comfortable, reliable (mostly) and gets good gas mileage.   The bad - the repairs we've had to do.   When you buy a car at a reputable dealership, you don't anticipate having such major repairs to make.    The ugly - the $2,000 we will most likely be stuck with when we get the call from the dealership later today.",,

3,Oil and Engine Issues :(,Nick Franky ,05/20/2016,3,2,3,,,2,4,2,4,,,"I've had my car for a while now. I bought it in 2011, 2 years old for about 13k. After replacing the melting dash, door protectors and starter. I now have issues with oil, I took my car for its scheduled oil change and the mechanic says...""You have no oil in you car, and its back firing, I think you should take it to the dealer because we wont be able to do an oil change"". So I take my car to Toyota and the keep it over night. they tell me nothing seems wrong but the are testing the oil consumption I have to  bring it back within 1200 miles. BUUUUUUUT my check engine light is on and when I start my car it trembles, I have to let it sit for a while or restart the car. This was my first car I bought all alone, Finally paid for in full and this POS gives me hell after I make my final payment(April) . oh yeah, a mechanic told me its about 6k to fix, car is only worth 5k!I don't think I will buy another Toyota...Honda here I come.",,

3,Oil today and gone tomorrow!,Tonya Stafford ,05/01/2016,3,4,4,,,3,5,3,4,,,"I have had oil consumption issues since about year one.  I have owned it 8 years and have complained continually about the oil consumption issues.  It uses a quart by 1300 miles after an oil change and another quart at 1100 more.  I have driven it until it wouldn't crank only to discover there was no visible oil on the dip stick.  I had the oil consumption test and qualified, waited almost a year on a waiting list to find out by accident that it was not documented correctly.  I recently qualified again and am now waiting for the necessary parts which could take some time to come in.  Seriously, my engine might be shot by then.  Not sure I'll buy another Toyota, after all, this is the same car that caused me to almost crash as my gas peddle got stuck and drove me through main street at about 65 mph!  Toyota should be better than this.  Other than those two major problems, the car has been pretty good.  My husband's Toyota Tundra is 14 years old and has 200,000 miles with no problems yet and we bought it new.  Toyota might have slipped on quality where it mattered during the years my car was made.I traded this car in September of 2016.  Toyota had still not managed to get the parts to fix my car's oil consumption problems.  It had a sticky dash that was on recall and I was just less than 200 down on the list to get it fixed.  It had 123,000 miles on it.  I just could not deal with the issues anymore.  I did not replace it with a Toyota.",,

There were 2 very minor recalls on it.  I had them both checked and fixed by the dealer at no charge. It was a floor mat and power door switch. Besides my car still looking practically brand new on the inside and outside, it still runs like new and is the most affordable car I have ever had to maintain.  It drives nice and smooth.  I will say that the seats are comfortable enough.  I wish they had more lumbar support.  Overall, this is the best vehicle I have ever owned.  I have owned 3 other cars and a few trucks.  Different makes and models.  I will only be buying Toyota from now on.",,

4.125,2009 Base Camry,balkania ,05/02/2014,,,3,4,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"Bought the car brand new (3 miles on it). Currently I have 130,000 miles on it and I've had zero issues. I drive mostly highway, very little stop and go. Out of boredom I changed the spark plugs and the PCV Valve at around 80,000 miles. Been changing my own oil since the 50,000 mile mark. The only issue is the oil consumption. From the 50,000 mile mark to now the car would consume 2 quarts out of the 4.5 i put in over 5000 miles. On the most recent oil change I only got back 1.5 quarts of the 5 quarts I put in .(added 1/2 quart at around 3000 miles). Seems like the car has turned a corner",,There is a fix for the oil consumption. All 2007-2009 v4 Camry's consume oil. There is a defect as admitted by Toyota with the piston and piston rings.

5,Good Machine,nolanm ,02/28/2014,,3,5,,,5,,5,5,,,"The transmission is quick to kick down to a lower gear and hold the rpms high when I need it to.When I'm driving easy it drives easy as well and gives me soft buttery shifts at low rpm.It also has an engine braking feature that automatically downshifts if it senses I am dragging the brakes on a long grade. You couldn't ask for a better automatic. Handling is soft which I prefer, but it also has great feel at the limit, if a turn is taken too fast it behaves predictably and its easy to regain control.I love the interior, it's minimalist by design, very classy.Update: I replaced the water pump at 80k miles.  It was easy to do and cost about $75.  No sign of the excessive oil consumption some are experiencing.  I use synthetic 0w20 oil and rev the engine hard on occasion which I feel is essential.",,

The first thing we noticed is rattles in the dash panel, which Toyota told us would cost 900$ to fix. (p.s. ifixed most of the rattles for 10$ by applying a thin strip of spongy material under the dashboard clock). Another thing that was little strange is the whining noise coming from the engine on low rpms, but after asking around i was told its the way engine works and no problems after 10 k km.

5,Best Car I've driven and owned,mike_inmid5 ,02/23/2013,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"First off, I have been in sales for 25 years. Many of those years were company supplied vehicles. Ford Taurus', Explorer. Have also owned Dodge Pickup, etc. All typical American vehicles. This Camry is just so much more refined than all those vehicles. Despite it being a 4 cylinder, the vehicle is plenty fast, and can pass at will (unless someone is doing 90 mph, then I wont pass them).Interior is great, I get a lot of compliments believe it or not, with SE the Ice Blue color. I have had zero maintenance problems. NADA ! Just change oil. At 46,000 miles now, and love every minute of it. The engine is bulletproof, and the ride is very comfortable. I'll likely keep it until 250,000 miles. ","Black cloth interior of SE package is actually very nice looking. Don't need to waste money on the leather, and very comfortable on long drives or short commutes. Looks of this vehicle is best looking Camry ever ! Gas mileage averages around 27, city highway. I have gotten 34 on a tank, with city mixed in. I get compliments on looks, perhaps bc of the ice blue color and SE spoiler. SE suspension and tuning is excellent ! Stereo is great too. I cannot find anything I dont like about this vehicle. Seriously. ","The only suggestion would likely be from my wife. She is only 5', and the way the seat is, its hard for her to get a good position, without being too close to the steering wheel. Perhaps some internal re-design on seat height. I'm 5'10"" and its perfect for me. "

But even before we made it to 7 months, we were looking for a SUV platform vehicle to replace the Camry. The Camry is what it is. Solid transportation.

When I first took it on the highway the steering wheel shook pretty bad. The used dealer balanced all of the tires, and it did get better. A week later he put on 4 new tires and it was a vast improvement. However, approaching 45K, the rotors are warped , as I can feel pulsation when applying brakes. The car does shake again on the highway. Also the gas mileage is junk! Probably the way I drive because I went from a 6 cyl to 4, but when being conservative I only got 27mpg at best. Interior cheap and uncomfortable, paint is chipping on plastic body parts.",The auxiliary port.,"My 220 HP V6 Mazda got 25 MPG, with me driving aggressively. The 4cyl Camry gets 24 on average.

I have had the weirdest problems with this car, ie accelerator and brake pedals that have a mind of their own.In the past year the car has developed an annoying and extremely dangerous problem where the tension of the gas pedal seems to be constantly changing. Sometimes, it responds with just the slightest amount of pressure, other times, applying it with the exact same amount of force results in no acceleration at all.It's like the car encounters dead spots where it simply refuses to accelerate.You'll need a burst of power to pass or just to get out of someone's way, and it won't be there!","(Continued) I'm don't claim to be a mechanic, but I commute more than an hour to work each day. I feel like I can accurately say that this Camry has serious acceleration problems that I suspect have to do with the electronic nature of the throttle system.

The worse part is, I am very apprehensive while driving it because it has so many blind spots.The rear window has extreme poor visibility.The car also makes wide turns.I cannot judge when parking or turning onto lanes.I cant see the curb when I am making turns.I have to lean forward out of my seat when making turns because I cannot see where I am going.I have had a Honda, Buick, Nissan, Camry (2003), Chrysler, Chevy, Toyota Supra, and never had this problem before.Also, gas mileage is not as good as the 2003. Additionally, cheap paint job.In one year paint is peeling, yet my 2003 never had that problem in seven years!!The car also has poor pick up. The 2003 Camry was a far superior car in every way.My mechanic agrees with me. Toyota is now making garbage.I am so sorry that I did not buy a used 2003  2005 Camry.",None.,Go back to the 2003 model

It is so underpowered that it makes a lot of vibration and noise during acceleration.

I drove it straight back to the Kingsport dealer with only appx. 50 miles on it and the dealer agreed the paint was messed-up.

A booster valve was replaced twice, but the pedal remained soft and many times when pushed, went to the full extent of my leg.   I constantly needed to pump the brakes to get firm response.  Toyota brought their big gun techno guy to the arbitration, along with engineering specs.  I was the dumb consumer.  ALL testing that they did to determine that my Camry was fine, was done out of sight.

It was not. I took it to arbitration, which at that time, the technical people gave me a full explanation of the brakes design.  And, admitted that all prior service work done was a waste of time due to the brake design. The brake pressure is proportional. To top it off, the Toyota experts indicated that if I had the traction control option, things would have been different with the brakes. In the 2010 model they all have traction control as standard.  I guess Toyota dealers were unaware of the importance of traction control on the 2009, they did not stock this option.",,

I purchased a used '09 Camry SE with 20Km on the odometer several months ago and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could have my cake and eat it too.  This vehicle carries 4 adults in comfort, provides very good fuel economy, handles superbly, has decent acceleration, feels right at home on the freeway, looks like a sports car and has a very likable personality.  Overall, I am very pleased with the car.  I would definitely buy another.","The 5-speed automatic transmission and the 2.4 L are well mated providing smooth acceleration, responsive down- shifts and excellent manners at highway speeds.

There are minor squeaks in the driver's seat, and the back seat makes a popping sound. Rear view mirror is a little loose already.  The drive is silky smooth, however.  The 4 Cyl has surprising pickup and shifts are much smoother than the '09 Accords I test drove.  Handling of the SE is almost on par with the Accord and the ride is firm.  Highway noise is quite.

If you want a car that's that fast, offers a sporty ride and sporty handling - the Camry is not for you. I can tell you that this is the most stress-free car I have ever owned. It goes where I need it go without a complaint, is not a gas hog, and while not overly powerful - can hold its own on the highway. There has been lots of carping about the interior materials but I think they're ok and certainly better than the previous Mazda and Pontiac I owned. For an entry-level midsized car, I don't expect wood grain and leather. Anybody looking for reliable transportation for the long- term - this is the car for them.",The interior layout is excellent. When I stepped into the car for the first time it felt like I had been driving it all along. Controls are simple to use and operate.

The 2010 I4 models have more power. (If you really like more horse power get the V6 which is the same for 09 and 10 models).  The audio quality is OK but not impressive.

The Camry is very comfortable and a great ride.  I was a little disappointed in spending $60 for a fill-up after spending barely $30 before.  But that's the price of a larger tank.

It is so gorgeous on the inside and out, I hardly hear road noise, it has great ""get-up-and-go"", I love the sports shift option when I really need to move quick out of traffic!  I also love the way the front dash and gauge area is designed, it's very aesthetically pleasing!  It is truly a luxury car.  I almost went for the SE, but chose the XLE for the leather interior, sleeker design, and the color options I wanted.  There is just no beating this Camry! The only bummer is the rising gas prices, $50 only fills my tank to 3/4 full for about 1-2 weeks! But it's worth it! It is an absolute pleasure to drive!","Feel incredibly safe in it, interior/exterior design, smooth steering, gorgeous!!",Only suggestion I could think of is to try and make the back bumper stronger!  I was rear ended at about 2 miles an hour and it tore the whole thing off!  I was so sad to lose it for a week to the repair shop!

I did not like the LE's interior from the beginning; it seemed cheaply made and had sharp angles. We wound up buying an SE because my husband preferred the sporty look and insisted we couldn't go wrong based on our experience with our previous Camrys. The following day I realized that this car has the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. Every time I drive it I wind up with a headache or sore neck. The headrest cannot be adjusted backwards or forward and pushes my head forward. I took it to the dealer to see if there was any solution, but they were unable to help. I am ready to dump this thing and I have only had since May!","Smooth ride, fuel economy is reasonable.","Whoever designed these incredibly uncomfortable seats should be forced to sit in them for several hours a day. Sitting in these seats is torture! The fabric on the SE is very rough, feels like sandpaper. I expected much more from Toyota."

Dollar for dollar it's very difficult to find anything better in its class. My vehicle has exceptional acceleration, braking, fit and finish, and more than ample room. I am 6'2"" and a solid 250 lbs. and it is very comfortable. By the way, I test drove the 2008 Honda Accord extensively prior to my Camry purchase. The Honda was very, very nice--but for me the Camry was simply more refined.    ","The engine and exceptionally quiet cabin are outstanding.

Though only an i4, the car handles impressively --- LOVE the round-abouts! ;)  I previously had a '94 Camry Coupe, and traded in my '04 LE for the '09.  I have noticed the fit/finish is not quite as crisp/clean as in my prior Camrys, but IMO still very good.  In fact, my '09 fit/finish appears to be improved over the '07/'08 models.

I checked out the Accord and the Altima and the Camry is so much quieter than those it is unbelievable.  The only extra I got on mine is the JBL audio system which lets me make hands free calls.

I opted for the 2009 SE with the 4 cylinder.  This is a superb vehicle.  It has all the convenience of a four door with a large trunk and yet has the looks of a sports car.  I chose the 4 cylinder strictly based on the economy. The vehicle hugs the road.  If you do a lot of Autobahn type driving purchase the SE and you will enjoy the sport tuned suspension.  GREAT vehicle in this price range.

The seats in the Camry are the most uncomfortable seats of any car I've ever owed. The ride is smooth and the car is quiet, decent gas mileage and nice style. NO pickup at all. This car is to big for a 4 cylinder and it hesitates when you press on the gas as you start off. Not good if you plan to do a lot of highway driving.

Love the quiet ride, especially over city bumps. Found the Accord not as forgiving in the city. If you do a lot of highway or curvy country road driving get the Accord with the vehicle stability package. Otherwise, if you live in the city get the Camry. It's more a ""squishy"" comfortable drive with good sound ""muffling"" ability. Also, this is picky but the a/c on the Camry works alot better than Honda especially when speed varies.","Quiet ride, handles city bumps better, better a/c cooler, color selection in beige (cloth) was better than Accord. You can buy only options you want. The 2009 Camry was cheaper than the 2008 Accord if I wanted a sunroof. ",Plastic console could have a little more quality to it.

The Camry fit that bill. It's not a fast sports car but the 4 cylinder has good performance for what it is. The style is sporty for a 4 door. It's not built like my Mercedes and I don't expect it to be for 45K less but it comes close enough for me to enjoy the car. We just put some nice wheels and tires on the car and that made a big difference in appearance. I now drive the Camry more than my Mercedes because of its fuel economy and I don't mind it a bit, it's a fine automobile.   ","Ride, handling (better with wider tires) fit and finish is good. MP3 player, stereo sounds fine after you adjust the bass to -3. Fully adjustable power seat with lumbar support. Tilt telescopic wheel. ",I'll have to add the wood grain kit to the interior.

The biggest complaint I have is the fuel economy. It said 23-31 mpg. I am only getting about 26, and I drive very conservatively. Hopefully it will do better when the air is not on and summer is over. There is also a loud noise when I take off from a dead stop. Other drivers here on this site had the same problem.

Although I admit I was careful accelerating and not going beyond 70mph, but drove upto 80mph.  Definitely has the power when you need it.  Impressed with the quiet engine.

I would have like to have gotten a few more bells and whistles by at least moving up to the LE model, but I was on a very tight budget.  Overall, I'm happy with the quality, peformance, and comfort of the car.  The 4 cyl engine has more pep than I thought it would.  I have less than 400 miles on it, but no complaints.

The Camry clearly was superior in how quiet and smoothly it drove compared to the others. It has noticeably less acceleration from a stop but it still gets the job done. The leather seats are superior to the others.  I would say that a person who needs a sedan but prefers a sportier feeling car then a different choice would be better. For those looking for a luxury feel the Camry wins.  ","The wheel controls operate the radio, blue tooth and climate control without getting in the way.

I took the car back in a few days later as it was still making the noise. The mechanic said that a baffle in the fuel tank was loose and that was the noise we were hearing.

4.75,Great New Car,New Toyota Owner ,02/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Recently purchased the New 2009 Camry SE. I like nearly everything.
