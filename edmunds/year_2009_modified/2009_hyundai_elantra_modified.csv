4.5,Great car after 3+ years,sreston ,04/16/2012,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I bought this new for under $15k, and am delighted with the features, low cost of ownership, and overall quality of the car.I love the problem-free driving, nicely peppy engine, comfort and interior space (I am 6'5""). The car still looks new inside and out.I have had a few small issues as follows:*Driver's seat makes a clicking sound in the lowest position*Rear window sometimes made a crackling/popping sound when going over laterally uneven ground, but this went away last year after I put some product on the weatherstripping*Driver's side window made a popping sound when rolled down--it was sticking to the stripping. Silicon lube fixed itOtherwise the car has required zero repairs."," Very cheap to run. No repairs, oil changes at independent mechanics, basic stuff like filter changes I DIY for almost no $--they are incredibly easy on this car, as are other things like lightbulb changes from what I've read.",

Check engine light keeps coming on. Had it in for this several times. Dealer can't or won't fix it.2. Tire pressure light kept coming on.They seemed to fix that, so far.3. The theft alarm keeps randomly coming on.Just did it again this morning. Multiple trips to dealer, no fix.4. Winshield washer quit. Tank full, pump runs, no water.Will take it back in again.",,"Install a passinger side door lock.
Had I noticed that tere was no keyed entry on the passinger side I would most likely not have purchased the car, at least not before checking out other brands.

The idiot lights come on sporadically (ESC,ABS,TPMS). The longest one has stayed on was over an hour. I don't know if the ABS and ESC are working. Another common problem for Hyundai.

Been a pleasure to drive and own!Very impressed with the gas mileage.Best mpg at 39.7 mpg based on filling up the car and doing the math on a calculator this was in NYC traffic 90%hwy and 10%city.Average mpg I receive when i do about 50/50 driving was 28 mpg still pretty impressive since I am not light footed.Pros: Performance, MPG, Price, Radio, USB, Blue Lights, tons of features, interior space, many storage comp'ts, quiet interior, Cons: Whine from radio (most wont hear), loud rattle from rear window hitting large bumpsBest bang for the buck!","Very comfortable to drive in although my right leg gets a cramp when I am stuck in traffic for over 45 minuts I am 6'3 though.
Radio system is excellent, impressive performance have no problem passing people on the hwy, great mpg

4.125,Competent Commuter Except in Snow,waldteufel ,02/15/2011,,,3,4,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"I bought this car new in July 2009 for my daily commute and to run kids around town for music lessons, sports, you name it.The positive reviews, incredibly low price, and long warranty make this basic piece of transportation ideal for my needs now. MPG varies from 28-33 combined depending on the weather, really expected much better.It took a long time to get adjusted to the clunky, sticky manual transmission; nothing like the Mercedes 230 or VW Golf sticks I used to drive.I tried to find an American brand vehicle of similar cost and quality but nothing came close. ","The low, low price and complete lack of mechanical problems is great, but the high torque and quick accelleration with the 5-speed stick provides as much fun as a middle-aged suburban dad can hope for, plus the iPod connection and XM radio keep the kids occupied.
","There is already a new Elantra model, but used car buyers in the rust belt should know this thing is terrible in winter weather driving conditions, I don't know if its the weight distribution or the tires but I'm buying real winter tires next year.
The cheap-feeling plastic interior scratches easily and the wierd stretchy seat fabric gets and stays dirty looking.

2.875,wouldnt recommend to anyone,Anonymous ,12/08/2010,,,3,3,1,2,,3,3,5,3,"very unhappy with the car, haven't even had it 2 years yet and I'm having problems, luckily nothing with the engine, it all seems to be electrical or interior problems except for the awful noise that my back window makes when I go over bumps, it makes this loud cracking noise like the window is going to fall out. Also you can tell the interior is cheap plastic because while driving all I hear is rattling, like something is loose in the dash. I will be getting rid of the car ASAP. Also had a brand new 2008 Accent before this car and had engine problems and brought it back within 8 months of purchase. ",The AUX input,overall they could work on the quality of the car. 
4.5,Are we all driving the same car?,GrampaL ,11/09/2010,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I swear some of the reviews are on different vehicles.  My carpet fits, radio works, the engine runs well, the car handles well, and it's relatively quiet at all speeds, gets 34 mpg on Xway (28-29 in town) as advertised. I have had no problems whatever with only routine maintenance.  The OEM tires aren't great in snow, but here's a tip folks - it's the tires.. not the car.  I had this problem in spades on a Maxima years ago. Buy some others if you ain't happy. You'd be amazed at the difference tires can make.  Not sure what people expect, but this car meets or beats the competition at a lower price.  It's comfortable, roomy and comes with a superior warranty. What more can you expect?  ",SE rides and handles well for what it is - a 4-door sedan. Has front and side curtain airbags. The MPG is easy to learn to like.

4.5,Good Car,Daniel ,10/31/2010,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,5,4,"I enjoy my car. It is a commuter car and is well suited to its purpose. I get 33 mpg average and keep the oil changed. I have had no problems with it other than the vanilla nature of it.  I knew of its commuter purpose when I bought it though so I'm not surprised. The ride quality is soft and smooth, it does well wet weather but I have no information on snow. The brakes are outstanding, only complaint I have is the engine noise above 3000 rpm is a little intrusive. Overall I have had a positive experience and I hope to drive this car into the ground for the next ten years.",The manual transmission is one of the best I have ever driven.,Better power windows and a different interior fabric would help.
4.5,Exactly As Advertised,ODU Dad ,10/24/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"My daughter has been looking for a car for a while and I decided to assist her.  After looking at various options (mainly through other reviewers such as here), I started focusing on the Elantra.  Because I am concerned for my daughter's safety, I decided to focus on the SE model, which also has traction control and stability control.  The next step was to find one that was economical but had relatively few miles on it.  I found a used 2009 SE with about 9k miles on it and bought it for 13k.  After using it for about a month, we are very pleased with the car.  It is exactly as advertised: a well built car with many important safety features that doesn't cost an absurd amount of money.","Safety features, great value compared to the competition.  The radio is good.","The interior is mainly monochromatic. Different panels of varying colors could help break up the monotony.

I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. I have made contact with the dealership but little response to issues. ""if the car engine light is not on it's ok"". I don't think so.

It gets good mileage (about 30 avg). I've driven manuals all my life, but struggled with this clutch a bit, stalling much more than 96 Accord. It does not do well in snow, I siped the tires and it helped a bit. I think it is the tires. I like the tighter steering and well thought out interior.  I wish they had made it easier to use iPod. I feel the car at high speeds is working too hard. Noisy at highway speed. Love the reliability and ownership cost of this little car.

I am surprised to see people putting numbers below 30 mpg. I haven't gotten anything below 32 mpg. I got 36 my last fill up. I commute 70 miles a day driving around 55 mph most the way.

It suddenly acted as if it were stuck in 3rd gear.  Brake made odd sounds and began to emit powerful burning smell. We thought we might have a transmission problem.

This is the first new car I've purchased since 1991, and only Hyundai managed to convince me the purchase would be worth the investment.  So far, so good....","Warranty, gas mileage, reliability...",More cupholders - we're a thirsty family...
2.625,Not Happy with the ride.,Catherine Curtis ,11/13/2009,,,3,3,3,3,,1,3,2,3,"This car vibrates like a lumber wagon and it has Solis tires on it.  That could be the problem, but I don't think so.  I have had 2 4-wheel alignments on it and the wheels balanced 3 times in 17,000 miles.  It is now in for rebalancing again at the price of $100.00, plus diagnostic fees. I had a 2003 Hyundai Elantra and it was a great car.  Drove it for 6 years 100,000 with the wheels taken care of 2 times. Fuel economy is not as good as advertised or as good as my 2003.",Handles really good on the corners. Also like the XM radio when it works.  I had it replaced once and it still has problems when you go over a bump; it will turn off or the volume blares to the top.,Get better tires on it like a Michelin that the 2003 had.

I am getting 24mpg and the dealer and Hyundai just say they can't find anything wrong with it.  They are not doing anything about it but giving me the run around.  I will never purchase another Hyundai again!!!  Should have bought the Toyota like I was thinking about!,Interior is nice and so is the XM radio,Listen to your customers.

It is felt in the driver's feet.  I took the car to the dealer ship and was assured that this is 'normal' by the service department.  I did not run it above 2500RPM during the test drive. The manual says that during the first 600 mile break in to run the engine between 2000-4000rpm. The vibration has reduced a little since August 2009.","XM radio built in.

4.25,Very solid car and a great deal,Chris G. ,07/26/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,3,4,4,4,"I am amazed about how solid the car is and how much fun it is to drive. Nothing creaks or feels cheap. The car exterior (we have the dark blue) looks stunning. Inside even at highway speeds there is little road noise and it is extremely comfortable. Drove its first 200 miles today. Mileage for an unbroken in car was 36+ on highway. Lots of features that are expensive add-ons for other cars and it is very safe. The iPod interface works with my iPhone 3G even in very limited testing, just tell your iPhone not to go into airplane mode when you plug it in. Bluetooth interface in the car works, although I thought speaker volume sounds low.","Ton of safety features not found in cars in this price range (ABS, stability control, traction control), iPod interface, quiet ride, comfortable seats, great mileage (36+ on highway). Oh, how can I forget the best warranty in the business? 5yrs/60k bumper-to-bumper and 10yrs/100k powertrain!","Engine could always use a little more pep. Bluetooth interface needs louder call volume. Should really be a 5 or 6 speed automatic. Ok, I am really nit picking here."
4.75,Not disappointed,MG41 ,07/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I purchased the top of the line Elantra (in Canada-limited edition) because of the ESC feature- but decided that the leather seats and sunroof and automatic climate control might be nice to have. I have thoroughly enjoyed the car so far- it drives beautifully and quietly and is responsive and roomy and very comfortable for driver and front seat passenger- no experience yet with someone in the back seat. The interior finish is first class and the layout of the dashboard and all features are consistent with a much higher priced vehicle. I checked out the competition- Corolla, Civic, Mazda3, Ford Focus and found the Elantra a better deal for the money and the 5 year/100,000 warranty is a plus.","ESC, four wheel ABS disc brakes, great dashboard and interior features and excellent climate control- wonderful handling and quiet ride and sufficient power and zest for all driving.",way to lock trunk so it cannot be opened unless one has the key rather than from the interior button.
5,Better Car,Scott ,07/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This vehicle is 100% solid. I have owned Toyota, Honda, Chevy, and Saturn. This vehicle is just as solid and well built if not better built than all other vehicles on the road. INCLUDING HONDA OR TOYOTA. Yes believe it or not. And there warranty program is the BEST in the nation. THIS IS A WONDERFUL VEHICLE","MP3 Connection, Sunroof.",
4.75,Quiet Car,Robert Makela ,06/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,5,5,"I love the Hyundai Elantra.  It's very quiet compared to most small cars.  I tested a Toyota Corolla and it was miserably loud and I would never, ever get one of those now.  I hate when small cars, just because they're small and ""economy"" based, they are loud in the cabin interior.  The Elantra really stands out because the cabin is so nice and quiet.  I was going 55mph and there was no road or wind noise.  The only time it gets a little loud is when you're really stepping on the gas, but that's because it's a 4cyl.  I'm quite happy with how quiet the car is","Quietness, smooth ride","Maybe put some more sound proofing between the engine and the cabin, that would make this car even better."
4.875,"Great looking, fun car to drive",Bryan Gotch ,06/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I bought a GL model (Canada) based on all the positive expert and owner reviews I read about it, including its above-average warranty and great price. I've had it for just under a month and so far I haven't been disappointed. I'm especially impressed with the interior room. I'm 6-feet, 250 pounds and the head and leg room in both the front and rear seats is excellent. I find the seats very comfortable. The dashboard layout is well thought out and convenient (stereo, storage compartments). I've read negative reviews about engine power, but it's plenty for me. Overall, it's a great looking, comfortable, fun car to drive.","The looks and layout of the dashboard, exterior front and rear lights. Also, the rear doors aren't too long, making it real easy to get in and out of tight parking spots. This seems to be overlooked by car-makers and buyers. The rear side port windows aren't attached to the rear doors, saving space.","The plastic interior door panels scratch very easily. The driver's side around the handle is really bad. Be extremely careful with your watches and rings! Also, the air conditioning is not great and the dash lacks a temperature gauge."
4.625,Got what I hoped for,Midwest Driver ,06/04/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"The 2009 shot up to the top of the list based on it's reliability reports and its' price.  I've only driven it 1200 miles but am very happy with the fit & finish as well as with the loads of options.  The 5 spd manual is a lot of fun with its spirited acceleration. I averaged 35 mpg on a road trip of 660 miles. The steering wheel is on the heavy side, but it nicely responsive.  ",Spirited acceleration - Quiet comfortable ride - Great gas mileage - A very nice car with the bonus of a low price.,Drop the passive alarm system - Lighter steering - 
4.75,Best Value in Class,cubordinate ,05/17/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought this car three months ago as my first car. Was thinking about getting a Toyota Corolla but the price was $100 more per month for less! The build quality and feel of the car is great. Heated seats get very warm and phase from hot to warm which can really loosen your back muscles during your commute home! Full tank will get you about 600-650 kms for $35 bucks Cnd ($30US). Recommended accessories: Ipod connection, Window Rain blockers, Petal and gear shift kit, Rubber mats. If you ask at the dealer they will throw these accessories in with the car for free.",0% Financing makes 5 year payment period excellent option. Car feels solid in every way. Stereo sounds great. More room in every direction than Corolla.,Manual reverse can take a bit of getting used too as you need to be 95% on the clutch to slip it into the gear. Company should push their quality comparisons more to increase resale. 
4.75,Great Car,Knight ,05/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"Really enjoy the Elantra and it is a much better value than the overpriced Corolla or Civic.  The SE comes with almost everything you could ask for, while on the Toyota or Civic, so much is optional.  When you add the options that the Elantra has standard, the price easily exceeds 20k!   As for the comments about the wheel wells and mud guards.  Well, the Elantra is not a 4X4 all terrain vehicle.  If you want a car for gravel and other off pavement environments, you should have gotten the Santa Fe.  ","Standard equipment, iPod/USB ports, heated mirrors, good sized trunk for a small car, ESC and traction control!!  ",A little bigger 4 cyl. engine would be nice with a little more horsepower.
4.25,exceeded my expectations,david j. jones ,05/06/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"Drove to southern Indiana from no. Ill. The week of purchase. The car is better than I hoped. Got 34 mpg on the way home. Car is quiet, smooth, and handles well. Was considering a Toyota; but I believe I got more bang for my buck on the elantra. Satellite radio is great. We, re taking the elantra to no. Wisc. Next week. Out Camry is staying in the garage. I would recommend this car for anyone on a budget. Djj. ",satellite radio. upgrade pkg. on gls. interior details.,would have likes stability control/traction control as an option on the gls.
4.625,2 more inches of rear seat room,loyal hyundia buyer ,05/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,5,4,this car would basically be perfect just shrink the trunk like two inches and add like two more inches too the rear seat and you have the perfect car,xm and ipod,more room in back seat dont need that much trunk space
4.75,The Hyundai that can,AbeFrohman1986 ,05/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"After owning a lemon-like 2001 Kia Rio with my wife for 7 years, it was time for a new car.  Living in the city, we needed an affordable, not too big car, that offered lots comfortable options. The Hyundai Elantra met those criteria. Our salesman showed us a GLS model with the option package, XM Radio, Cruise, Anti-Lock Brakes and a Sun Roof. Sans Alloy wheels and nifty bluetooth feature of the SE, it was still a remarkably refined and comfortable compact with a smooth and definite road presence on 15 inch steel wheels. 138 HP 2.0 pumps solid life into the car and sitting in the soft cloth seats moving down a rough road, you feel safe and comfortable. Hyundai is making a great car.   ","Sunroof, XM Radio, 6 speaker audio system, remote trunk release, all air bags, anti-lock brakes with Electronic Force Distribution. Tire Pressure Monitoring. Blue ambient light on clock, trans, gauges gives the car a hint of luxury- Very Cool! ","Leather wrapped steering wheel would be nice to feel, but it's not terrible otherwise.   "
5,Great Safety,Rick Patel ,04/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Driving is always fun with this car when you can enjoy the best music on XM and your MP3 disc player. I had a recent crash with my new car and you won't believe but as per the advertisements, the car truly provided 5 star rating and we had not a single scratch on our body...I thank Hyundai for providing such great security features...I will buy a new 2009 model in a month time...","Color, look, style, control, internal features",Higher HP
3.875,Cheap Wheelwells / Mudguards,Darrel ,03/11/2009,,,4,4,3,4,,3,4,4,5,"After only 3 weeks and 300 km of winter grid road travel, all 4 wheelwells and all 4 mudguards are damaged.  1 mudguard has a 4"" diameter hole clear through it.  I am fortunate enough that my dealer is replacing all 4+4 free of charge in addition to coating them with a rubber compound calling it a ""Goodwill"" repair.  For your information, the temperature has been ~-30°C.  My maximum grid road speed was always less than 100 km/hr.  The odd thing is, there is basically NO gravel left on the road since it's not graded in the winter... currently the maximum particle size is only ~5mm.","Heated leather seats, decent factory stereo. Fun to drive.",Sturdy wheelwells and mud guards.  This needs to be addressed since the majority of Saskatchewan travelers do travel on gravel roads.  Needs another inch or two of headroom.  My hair brushes the roof and I'm not a tall guy.
5,Great Car,tom ,02/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We picked up the car and in Tempe, AZ and drove to Coursegold, Calif.  It was a great trip.  The car was comfortable to drive and we averaged 37 MPH.  The trip was only 1700 miles but so far we loved the car.  Lots of room inside, looks great inside and out.  Loved the XM Radio, 50s & 60s music all the way.  Will write more as we get mores miles.  We believe we will continue to love the car.","The safety features are great. The price , compared to other cars Honda, Toyota, and Mazda.  Also the warranty is the best.",Can't think of any as of now.
4,So far so good,HusbandOfToyotaLover ,02/11/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Bought my Hyundai Elantra 2009.  I had to convince my wife, who is a loyal Toyota driver, that at 15K - 16K Hyundai Elantra is the best deal over against any Corolla we can buy.  So far I haven't regret it and my wife likes it.  The engine is adequate, I mean who buys an Elantra to floor-it anyway?  It is surprisingly comfortable and handling is surprisingly adequate (mind you I am used to driving Honda Civic myself.) Rear seat is small but trunk space is adequate.  I have to say, at the price for VSC, ESP, ABS, XM (3 months), BlueTooth, MP3, and IPod player this car is the best bang for the buck.  Of course you will take a hit at resale so keep that in mind.  We like to drive them to death","ESP, VSC, Air bags",Bigger engine.  I wouldn't mind shelling out another grand for 30 more hp. 
3.875,Excellent alternative to Civic/Corolla,DavidC ,02/01/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,3,"I am a loyal Honda Civic owner, and my wife is a loyal Toyota Camry/Corolla owner.  So we are still in shock when we are shopping for a replacement car this past month we decided on the 2009 Hyundai Elantra SE.  What made us make this decision?  For me it's not really hard to make after a comparison of features and pricing.  It's really disappointing how much Civic/Corolla has really jack up their prices, now you're paying more for the ""brand name"" then actual product.  The Elantra, by comparison, no longer just offers a cheap car at a cheap price, but it's a great car (by comparison) at an incredible price.  Anybody looking to buy Civic/Corolla should definitely give Elantra a hard look.","Stability Control, Brake Assistance, ABS, Front and Side airbags, IPod, XM, all comes in standard.",Bigger engine option.  138-hp is not bad but I would pay for more hp.  More rear leg room.  In my opinion they can take away another inch from the back end (trunk) and give it to the passengers in the rear.
2.75,Wheel Wells Broken,snowback ,01/22/2009,,,2,1,1,4,,4,3,4,3,"I have 4,000 Kms on my new Hyundai and the wheel wells have cracked and are broken in the front driver's side and in the rear - both sides! Hyundai Canada will not consider this a warranty issue and will not honor repairing the car.  The car was driven on gravel roads at temps or - 35 degrees.  If the car should not be driven on gravel roads, that means the car cannot drive on 77% of the roads in Alberta!!!!!  If this is what I have in two months driving how is the car going to look in two years?  JD Powers are completely wrong with this vehicle.  Will never buy another Hyundai.    ",,Better wheel wells
5,"Great purchase, superior in many ways",Mike ,11/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my Elantra just a couple of weeks ago and I am so happy with it. I did have an extended search and compared it with other cars like Honda Civic, Fit and Toyota Corolla, and my Elantra has everything I need, nothing to envy the competitors. Great look, smooth ride, the hp 138 gives great torque enhancing performance, very spacious inside, not feeling like driving in a ""can"" as I was feeling in others. Interior design is superior definitely, plenty of storage in easy to reach places. Blue tooth, ipod, satellite radio, what else do you need? Prior reviews on the '08 about safety speak for themselves, and this one has 5 star crash rating... Oh, of course, great gas mileage 33-35 mpg...","Looks, drive, gas mileage, comfort.","It's true they could use more expensive materials for the dashboard and others, but, so far it looks good as it is. So if it's going to increase the price I would leave it as it is."
