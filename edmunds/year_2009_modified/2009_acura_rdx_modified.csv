4,Bumpy ride,Jim ,05/07/2016,4,4,5,,,4,5,4,3,,,Gas mileage for 4 cylinder is poor and vehicle uses premium fuel. Ride is quite uncomfortable.,,
5,Sports car in SUV shell,Tim ,02/07/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"The sportiest of a batch of SUVs available that year: BMW X3, Volvo XC60, and Audi Q5. Excellent mechanical reliability, although a couple electronics issues with the side-view mirror.",,
4.25,Like an MDX and Accord all in one ,jbriscoe ,07/01/2012,,,5,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I owned a 03 MDX and 07 Accord V6 previously...I wanted to go back to a SUV...just not a large one. The RDX fit the bill for me. I get 22 mpg non highway driving at an avg speed of 28 mph, I drive 66 mi daily round trip to work. The turbo kicks in when needed and the ride inside the cabin is quiet. The road feel can be bumpy on poorly maintained streets and the handling is great on quick turns.If you need more cargo room and a fold down third seat, opt for the MDX and a few less mpg. I'm 5'3 and my husband is 6'1 and we both have plenty of head and leg room.","I like the large center storage console which can be locked up, the audio package, and the style of the vehicle. 5 star safety test rating. Programmable driver postions. Cup holders that can actually hold two large sized cups side by side. ",Keyless remote for the lift gate and keyless ignition would be great added features for Acura to consider.
4.75,Comparing the RDX to BMW X3,jmh12 ,12/29/2011,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded my X3 for a used RDX. While the X3 was a good car, it's reliability was waning after 100K. The RDX was a great choice. Reminds me of the X3. Ride is about the same (choppy over rough spots) but handles even better than the X3. Seems roomier and gets a bit better gas mileage. Sure you can get low miles if you keep your foot in the turbo. I'm getting 23 to 27 on the highway and 19 in town. This is the AWD version too. I have an MDX that's been a reliable car. I expect the RDX to follow suit. It's a great car for one who enjoys driving and isn't put off by the tight suspension. Plus it's an Acura.",Is roomy; handles great; accelarates well; nicely built; good quality; good value,It should be possible to engineer the car for a smoother ride...perhaps a cruise and sports mode that adjusts the suspension.
4.5,What a snatch!,itzsyk ,12/17/2011,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"It's been 2 great years since I first picked this baby up. The biggest reason for choosing this car, is because the 2.3 liter engine from Honda is only used in the RDX. The small turbo is also very peppy. There's virtually no lag - VTec kicks just under 4k rpm. Unfortunately, the drop in peak power is very noticeable. The ride is stiff, but supple. Just enough to feel confident without suffering back pains. I put regular gas for 1k miles recently, and to my surprise, there was no loss in power. But, there was loss in the stiffness of the steering wheel. Regardless, I advise premium gas. The brakes were the biggest disappointment. They feel like they stop 60-0 in 130-140 ft. ","Instant turbo boost. Smooth transmission and great sport gear ratio. Absolutely love the huge center console - when you open it, it's big, then you open the divider and it doubles in size. SH-AWD came in handy during last year's winter as well. Had to drive a stretch of 50 miles in a blizzard, and the car was able to cruise at 50mph, until the trucks stopped my trekking.","Please just add at least another gear. Honda uses 6 speeds in their other cars, yet they still use the 5 speed in the redesigned RDX. R&D need to step it up. I drive this car around campus 80% of the time and I'm averaging 12 mpg, no joke. I get 200 miles on the full tank during my best weeks. That 17 mpg city seems like a gimmick. On the bright side, I average 26mpg on the hwy."
4.75,compares to other luxury vehicles,ronispeech ,07/05/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"We have driven Lexus, BMW, Jeep and Infinity SUV'S and have been most impressed with our Acura RDX!!This SUV handles beautifully and we have only required scheduled maintenance for oil changes.We plan on purchasing/leasing a second RDX this spring.",Seat design and comfort!!!,Heated steering wheel
4.75,Love this car,Lindsey ,03/29/2010,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I'm really enjoying this SUV! I really love the size and room it has on the inside! The only problems that I've had are the speakers, I blew three of them! And I have no idea how! This car is fun to drive and everyone that rides in this car loves it! I looked at many SUV's before purchasing this one! This one was by far the best! Perfect size and not a lot of people have this car! SO you wont have the same car as everyone else!",great car fun to drive! Great size and love the turbo,Navigation is not great and speaker system could be better! They could of put vents in the backseat!
4.375,Know what you're buying,Nick ,03/21/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,3,3,5,"We wanted a AWD vehicle to travel in winter to Northern NV and Sierra Nevada mtns. We wanted a small SUV.  We loved the CR-V but it was a Dog (4 Cyl.) and the Rav4 was stylish 10 years ago, so we checked out the RDX.  It has impressive quickness & handling and it's really fun to drive.  What we didn't expect is the gas mileage.  We have only gotten 17 mpg in town once and highway isn't much over 20.  On long trips be prepared to gas up frequently (and always with premium). Overall I really like the SUV and the fact that the turbo doesn't lose power with elevation.  Know what your buying -an AWD SUV w/ a turbo- and accept that you won't get great mileage.",Sound system is great.  Clean exterior styling. Handling is much better than any other small SUV we drove and acceleration makes it feel more like a sports car.  No rattles shakes or other integrity problems so far.  Dealership has been great.  Love the 4 year bumper to bumper warranty.,More sound insulation to quiet the ride.  Remote tailgate should be available. Upgrade the interior style -the plastic is tacky and the radio controls are cheap feeling and hard to reach while driving.  The navigation screen is very hard see during the day in bright sunlight. 
4.5,It's almost one year,giri80 ,03/17/2010,,,4,4,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought this car as a graduation gift for my self! I already have 25,000 miles on the car drove all across the country. So far the ride is fun. Cabin can be a bit quieter, awesome 4 awd handling it's fun to drive in rain and snow. Fuel economy is excellent on hwy (24) but not good in city (17- 18). Interior materials can be of better material. Plastic used is of low quality. I love the seats though. Climate control, audio, back leg room and cargo space very good. I would suggest this buy over a crv, rav4 or Forester any day.

3.5,CAN'T WAIT TO GET RID OF,Double L ,02/06/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,3,1,"The dealer would NOT allow us to take on highway; now I know why.  The ride is so bumpy that you feel sick to your stomach.  We can't get the sports suspension changed because it will cause the warranty to be invalid.  I should have walked away after being jacked around by the dealership with agreeing to match printed price of others; and then hemm & ha for 5 hours trying to figure out how to get out of that one.  I should of, could of, and didn't; so now I'm stuck with a vehicle that makes me throw up on bumpy highways or gets us dizzy.",STYLE,SUSPENSION
3.75,Deeply Conflicted,fischb ,12/22/2009,,,3,2,4,5,,4,3,5,4,"I am deeply conflicted about this car.  It drives sporty and tight, but on rough pavement it is too bumpy.  There are 3 competing electronic displays, but technology is about 8 years old.  Voice recognition is the worst as is the nav.  Fuel economy is stellar for this segment, 22 MPG, but linear accelleration is impossible due to the mismanaged turbos.  The leather is cheaper than Benz's imitation stuff.  Handling on snow is bad due to torquiness, so I had to get snow tires.  Exterior styling is suspect, but I like its small size.  In the end, I am trading after one year for a BMW X6, if only to save my sanity from the tortuous fan whine when you turn on the heat.","Great gas mileage after the break in period.  Peppy turbos, comfortable seats.","Update the nav and voice to the at least the 2005 level. Fix nonlinear accelleration.  The fan whine is maddening.  Leather is cheap, nice cloth wold be better.  Consolidate electronic displays."
2.25,Worst car I have ever owned,Priscilla Morris ,12/04/2009,,,2,2,2,3,,3,2,2,2,"Rough ride, poor interior quality, way too expensive to be this bad . So sad it is such a sorry ride and quality.",storage room for the size is good,"THE RIDE, THE INTERIOR QUALITY, FUEL ECONOMY."
3.25,Never Again,Mark from Sacramento ,10/22/2009,,,4,2,5,3,,2,5,3,2,"My wife got the car and she seems happy with it, but I think the lack of visibility out the back is dangerous. The rear window is very small and then further blocked by the driver's headrest. Visibility out the driver's side is also bad because of the frame between driver and passenger windows. The real problem is the delay in acceleration which is maddening. Delay is usually 1 second but if you really need to pull in front of a car to make an exit you need to know it may the sequence which is engine revs, wait a second, wait a second, and then car accelerates, but not quickly. I can't believe this is supposed to be a premium car.  Also high hood blocks forward view a little.",Interior is nice and seats are very comfortable.,"Bigger rear window, lower hood, bigger engine. Bigger engine to eliminate amazingly long turbo lag."
3.625,Not overly impressed,Jack Gantos ,09/10/2009,,,3,5,4,5,,4,3,1,4,"I've had my RDX for nearly three years on a lease and I will be turning it in and not getting another. The gas mileage is well below what is listed at 17mpg in town. I live in Boston and drive around town and get about 11/12 miles per gallon, and I'm not a lead foot. The Turbo is not as responsive as it should be--there is some lag, but it is not bad when it kicks in. Just not as perfect as the sales people tell you it is. The interior is basic. Visibility is routine. Body design is nice. But the interior trim is just an upgraded version of a Nisson X-Terra. I question if my ""leather"" seats are really leather. They remind me of the Mercedes leather- like material I had in my Turbo D.    ",Good 4 wheel drive. Quick handling. Agile. Feels safe.,More luxury. Better leather. And definitely better gas mileage--gas mileage at present is really pathetic. And I dare the dealership to challenge my stats.
4.875,Fun to Drive,rd ,08/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love this car! I have an Acura MDX too but this thing is fast. The seats are very comfortable, cabin noise is minimal. I do not understand the poor mileage complaint. I have driven the car for last 7000 miles and I have consistently gotten around 22 mpg. Nice leg space in rear seats. Good sound system. Great value for money and without sacrificing the fun part. Fast acceleration when needed. If you are looking into CR-V or RAV4 with all options, please buy this instead. Worth it! Nice ride too. Truly, not bumpy at all. They must have and 'have' softened the suspension since the original 2007 model. Its as good as any other SUV. ","Engine, precise handling, very comfortable and adjustable seats. All the needed options in base come as standard. Huge center console space. SH-AWD works, had no trouble driving on icy/snow covered roads.",Heated back seats. Auto lights. Automatic telescopic wheel adjustment based on drivers (seats and mirrors are memory based).
4.625,"A fun, fun, fun sporty little SUV ",accurashopper ,07/10/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I absolutely adore this SUV! I drove a mid-size sedan for many years and it did take some time to adjust to the RDX. The tilt down mirror on the passenger side is wonderful when backing.  The interior is well laid out with all of the controls within easy reach.  The center console is deep - it holds my large purse with room to spare. The front seats are comfortable and there's ample knee space in the rear with the front seats all the way back.   Ride is firm - you feel some of the bumps and hear a little road noise, but the fun factor outweighs any of this.   Fits my small family perfectly. Represented an excellent value for the money compared w/competition.  Currently get 19 mpg city.","Sporty feel, leather seats, AWD, center console, convertible cargo area, moonroof.",Minor things:  Auto-dimming mirror should come with compass and  outside temp so other passengers can view info.  Put a manual trunk release near the fuel door release on the driver's side. Leather shift knob should be standard. 
3.5,Beware,Fred ,07/08/2009,,,3,3,4,4,,4,4,2,4,"This is not the luxury car that Acura should be selling.  Unlike other Acuras, the vehicle does not have automatic headlights, a basic safety and convenience feature available on similar, and many far less expensive cars.  The gas mileage is far less than advertised.  It is very difficult to open the rear door.  The instrument panel, particularly the radio controls, are poorly designed and difficult to use.  While the turbo engine is very good and the ride is decent, the car is not what I have come to expect from Acura -- they should be ashamed.",,
4,2 Years Later,Levelheaded ,06/16/2009,,,4,4,2,4,,5,4,4,5,"This is a jazzed up Honda at best. By no means does this truck have a true level of luxury, in fact, an Accord V6 may be more luxurious. That being said, it's all about performance in the RDX, and a fun factor that you will not find in any other smaller SUV. The RDX is the best driving small SUV out, it's faster, handles better, and has fantastic steering - new editions like the Q5 will give it a run, but its price keep it from being shopped together.","Turbo that works - minimal to no lag, strong acceleration, sports car moves, SUV carrying capacity, great back seat - more room than what appears, sports car suspension (it's stiff - too stiff), SHAWD works.","Interior needs to be more luxurious, get rid of the plastic dash, needs rear HVAC, hydraulic hood, rear lift gate release/power, 8 way pwer pass seat, materials on back doors need to match front doors (hard plastic trim vs soft padded materials) std 19 inch rims, more options."
5,Love It!,Lynne ,06/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just picked up my new RDX & I LOVE IT! I traded in my 10 yr old Saturn which I loved (low maint. & great reliability) but wanted an upgrade in quality (interior, features, etc). I do a lot of driving & the RDX has NOT disappointed so far. I read a LOT of reviews before buying & I have to say that the ride is a little rough but was expecting the ""sporty drive"" so I don't mind it. I have to respectfully disagree w/ complaints about the fuel economy. My 4-cyl Saturn ave. 30mpg, so I was prepared for a big bite into my fuel budget. Have put about 200miles on the RDX so far and I'm ave. 25mpg (60% hwy). Not bad! I don't dog it on the Turbo but it's a comfort knowing it's there if I need it.","Hands Free Link (use it A LOT), tire pressure gauge, AWD (haven't had opp. to try it yet), Turbo, sound system (whoo-ya!), this car is FUN!","Smoother ride, more voice command capability on HFL. Really minor stuff if you do your homework first and know what you're buying. I wrestled with whether to upgrade to Tech Pckg but opted not to. Maybe next time..."
4.75,Good value for Money,corduroygt ,06/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I got my RDX tech for around 32k + taxes.  I think for the price, the feature content is great.  I don't know why people think it rides harsh, I think the ride/handling balance is just right, sporty and confidence inspiring without being too harsh or floaty.   The worst thing about this car is the omission of a couple cheap-but-nice features, and the fuel economy, which could have been better if they put the V6 under the hood.  It's got more than enough power to deal with traffic.","Rear view camera, shift paddles, ride/handling/power balance.","Fuel economy, put 6 or 7-speed auto, Auto headlights, Auto wipers, keyless ignition, auto closing of windows/sunroof with the keyfob, swiveling bi-xenon headlamps."
4.25,Long term review,tom ,05/06/2009,,,4,4,4,5,,5,4,3,5,"Have owned the SUV for one year and 18k miles now. Fun to drive, good visibility, excellent handling and did real well in the New England winter. I am not a very aggressive driver and don't use the paddle shifters much.  I do a mix of highway and city driving. I am averaging 21 mpg.  The rear suspension is very firm which could be uncomfortable for rear adult passengers on longer trips. I owned another Acura five years ago.  I was disappointed with the fit and finish of my SUV.  Total of three trim pieces on the dashboard and passengers door panels were replaced under warranty because they became loose.  Had to also take it back for rattling sound behind the glove box .","Responsive engine and transmission.  Easy to use navigation system. Awesome handling, minimal body role on tight corners. Versatile vehicle. ",Disappointed with the fit and finish of this SUV.  Maybe it is just this car but have not had these type of issues with previous Acuras.

Negatives on the RDX no automatic headlights strange... almost awkward styling, poor mileage, no compass, very basic rims, rough ride for some, strange cargo cover.  Big Positves!

4.75,Great SUV,Rich ,02/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Just purchased this vehicle yesterday and just wanted to say that my family and I enjoy every feature. Very quick in response off the line. Can barely feel the gears shift. Interior very well designed. Many fun options even with a base model. Why spend 4,000 more for a nav and a couple extra speakers? Handling is great. Gas mileage is to be expected from having a turbo installed. To anyone else complaining about this you should do your homework first. Besides wouldn't want to give your car the best of the best servicing? That's what makes cars last longer. Take this for what it's worth yet this car is a great small family vehicle.","AWD, turbo (great low end power), quiet, handles great. Not too big of a vehicle but not too small for a family.

3.875,2009 Acura,Dave ,01/29/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,4,3,3,4,"I have had my Acura for 2 months now and have close to 1,800 miles. I have had a rattle on the left hand side of the car since 65 miles. I am bringing it back to the dealer again next week. The cars mpg has never gotten over 16. It is the winter in WI. It handles well in the snow but not any better than my BMW 525XI was. The interior parts are very cheap. It is very bumpy in the city and drives like a jeep wrangler. I had better expectations from this car. It is not of a near luxury type of car. I lease it and have to drive it for another 34 months. I was recently in a Ford Escape that did not rattle like mine and had a quieter ride.

High center of gravity concerns moot at anything up to 7/10ths driving (i.e. public roads) because of flat cornering and absorbing suspension.  (Absorbing as in GTI, not Buick.) Also useful in deeper snow.  It's not a sports car or sedan, but it's a a brilliant urban/suburban commuter, actually fun on a twisty parkway.  Seats are surprisingly good.

4.875,Best Bang for the Buck,Triple ,01/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Originally we were set on a wagon to replace both a Pathfinder and a Saab sedan. However, when you look at what's out there in similar trim levels (new - Saab, Audi, BMW, Volvo) they get comparable gas mileage, with just a bit more room, but for 10K+ more. That made the RDX a no-brainer. Yes, it has a firm ride - it's on the sport side of SUV. It's much better than a truck-based SUV (such as my PF), and by giving up a Caddy-like ride, you're rewarded with actual road feedback and sharp handling. Yes, gas mpg isn't the best - but it also has a turbo that has zero lag with effortless acceleration, and is no worse than other crossovers. This car's not for someone wanting a boring town runabout.","Actual comfy seats that provide grip and hold you in; that sweet, sweet turbo; AWD; gigantic center console you could hide a small child in; OEM accessories that are useful and fit nicely (cargo liner, mats, guards); bluetooth and hands free phone; aux input; super lighting; and on and on.","The cargo liner velcros in; I can see if you constantly take it in and out, the carpet will pill and fray.

When my Lexus RX350 lease ended I didn't want to get the same car twice and the MDX has gotten to big with no more kids or large dog to haul around.  There some features left off of this Acura which should be standard issue i.e. automatic headlights and power rear door, rain sensing wipers.  The gas mileage is ridiculous.

I just garaged my 600 hp track Vette, my Prius produced a distinct adrenaline deficiency.  Looked at Subaru WRX, WRX STI for fun factor in winter but too small for family.  The Acura is loaded with options, well built (solid), comfortable enough.  Make no mistake this mini-SUV is a BLAST to drive.  I am surprised they don't market this differently.  Turbo 4 banger, SH-AWD Michelin Pilot rubber - snow is good!  I can also fit kids, wife, dog, etc.  Very happy with performance, technology is overdone - voice recognition nav system rivals BMW iDrive as far as frustration level","Performs like nothing else in its class.  You can buy BMW x3 with sport package for $12k more - yes $12,000! and BMW is still slower in its responsiveness to changing road conditions.

4.875,5000 Texas miles with no regrets,Dstew ,11/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Ive been on just about every type of terrain and this SUV has performed admirably.  Highway and street ride and performance is great.  Pickup is a little slow under 20 MPH but really winds up once the turbocharger is engaged.  On the highway with the cruise set you can get 22-24 MPG at 75-80 MPG.  Great pickup at high speeds for highway passing.  In the city MPG is closer to 18.  On the beach the all-wheel drive helps out and takes bumps and loose sand very well.  Dirt roads are the same.  I have not taken it on much worse than maintained dirt roads because of the somewhat low clearance and I bought it mostly as a highway vehicle.  Almost every feature you need is included.,"One touch windows, audio quality, heated seats (not that I really need it), power driver seat, auxiliary audio input, huge center console, fitted rear cargo cover, turbo, xenon lights.  Excellent/ though somewhat stiff ride on all terrains.","Dusk-sensing head lights, better radio antenna (speakers are so good it picks up extra static, especially in rural areas), power passenger seat, sliding rear seat, one touch rear windows, cigarette lighter charger on when car is off, air conditioned seats (Lexus has it and it works great here in tx)"
4.875,"Fun, great mid-size SUV",LC ,11/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Let me say that I love Acuras because of the value you get with the car.  No other car gives you the high-tech toys for such a reasonable price.  All the toys work and make this a great car to drive.  It is very quick and responsive and am getting 21 MPG. It is impossible for people to be getting 14 mpg unless they are goosing the car every chance they get. This is not a luxury sedan.  What it is is a great 4WD SUV with luxury features and the best handling of any SUV I've driven. ,"Sound system, center console, SH-AWD which really controls the ride, content of the nav system, seat comfort","Nav screen subject to glare in daytime, keyless start."
2.125,Not Happy,Disappointed ,11/24/2008,,,3,2,2,1,,3,2,2,2,"Very disappointed, poor value for the price.  Seats are uncomfortable (I'm 5'10"", always hitting my thigh on steering wheel); nav system very complicated; voice recognition never accurate (say ""go home"" and nav responds with ""air conditioner off"").  Don't ever turn the car off with the steering wheel in anything but the straight position, if wheels are not straight, you will have problems turning the key in the ignition.  Gas mileage is awful; acceleration certainly not 'peppy'; requires premium gas; oil changes require synthetic oil.  Bought this car outright (not leased).  After 2 months I am considering getting rid of this car and buying something more comfortable with better nav & mileage.",Heated seats,"Touch screen nav, better acceleration, more comfortable front seats, better gas mileage, more cargo space, cupholder cover that opens to the right not the left, scrap the voice activation, reduce the price to be more inline with what the car really has to offer"
4.25,Exactly What I Expected,hm ,11/18/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,4,5,4,4,"This is not my first Acura. These vehicles are designed to be a balance between value and luxury.  Are they German engineered - NO. That said, they are good performers with great reliability. This is a fun vehicle to drive loaded with features that would be costly options on other brands.  Fuel economy is based upon how aggressively you drive and the car is not going to magically transform into something else after to take it home - so give it a good test drive!     ","Standard options, strong engine, well thought out interior","Standard roof rack, adjustable back seat"
4.375,Horrible Suspension for NYC,El Supremo ,11/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,3,"I bought the car looking at the Mazda CX7, Nissan Murano, etc.  Actually found that the RDX is only a bit more expensive then the Mazda so I went with it.  The look and interior is awesome but its way to stiff.  Every pothole makes the car jump, it feels like an old school jeep.   I bought it for comfort and luxury, but this is way to jeep.  It really gets annoying (even embarrassing sometimes.  I really love the car otherwise but this is a major flaw.","Navigation, voice activation.","Change the suspension. If you live in a city avoid it, you will go crazy.  I also worry all those bumps will be a problem in the future"
4.875,A winner for Acura,JEM ,11/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Having leased 2 MDXs over the past six years, I had no reason to look outside the Acura line to lease a new vehicle. I did, however want to economize on lease payments and no longer needed the additional space and seating of the MDX.  The RDX really fills the bill.  Super handling, great performance and real comfort for the driver and front seat passenger.  The traditional Acura safety features and interior appointments are apparent.  The voice activated tech package is awesome tho requires familiarity.  This is just a feel good vehicle to drive.",Very comfortable front seats.  The tech package and full featured nav system.  ,"The beautifully styled wheels are a pewter tint and always appear to be in need of cleaning, but that I can live with finding no other faults."
3,Buyer's Remorse,AJJ ,10/26/2008,,,3,4,3,3,,3,3,2,3,"I drove the RDX 2x before deciding to buy and I sincerely regret it. There are just too many quirks in design that make this vehicle really annoying. The gas mileage has not improved with time, only getting 13 mpg. The audio constantly dimming ANYTIME you hit another button on the dash. The drive is similar to a BMW which is fine. The fact that you cannot import an address book with the handsfree is just stupid. Other Acura models have this feature, except RDX. For a few thousand dollars more get a BMW. Yes they nickel and dime you to death on options, but they make a great driving machine. Acura, in my book, has a long way to go. ",Backup camera.,"The cup holder cover should open to the right, allowing the driver to not have to lift over the cover. The audio dimming when hitting any other buttons is annoying. The Zagat guide lists only 1 restaurant for all of SD. Bluetooth does not import address book. No automatic lights."
4.875,Acura RDX: good deal,dba ,10/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"First SUV I own, and very pleased with it. They did a great job to reduce the turbo lag; you can notice it but it is definitely acceptable. Very good looking SUV with the luxury touch you find on all Acuras. Looking forward to try it in snow here in Boston.","AWD, comfort.",Add DVD-video support to Tech package.
4.75,Drivers vehicle!,NirVTEC ,09/24/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,What a blast to drive! Hugs turns like a sport luxury sedan and pulls off the stoplight like Old V8s I have owned! ,Turbo AWD what more can I say?,"None so far although they did answer my request from last year about the power PASS SEAT. More space would be nice, but I am 6"" taller than the average person."
4.875,RDX A Great Car For Alaska,Ron in Alaska ,09/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Have less than 1,000 miles on the car and averaged 22 mpg on the second tank of gasoline with both town and highway driving.  The turbo comes on quick, if you need it.  We like the stiff suspension and look forward to the AWD during our long Alaska winters.  This is our third turbo car and they just keep getting better and better.  Enjoying the memory power seats and mirrors with two drivers of different heights.  With the easy to fold-down rear seats, it provides plenty of room for those shopping trips.  We spent a year looking at various crossovers and the RDX always moved to the top of the list.  We keep our cars 12+ years and look forward to a long term relationship. ","Very comfortable seats, turbo power when you need it.",No improvements required.
2.625,RDX  Worst Horrible Ride ever,Frank G CPA ,08/23/2008,,,2,4,4,3,,4,1,1,2,"First the RDX is NOT a luxury auto by any standards.  The ride is so harsh that on a mildly bumpy road your head bounces off the restraint.  On rough roads you had better hold the steering wheel very tight or you will get bounced off and lose control of the vehicle.  I got over the lack of simple luxury items like seats that fold onto themselves and no power rear gate but the ride is something else.  I am EXTREMELY sorry that I leased the '08 RDX.  Acura has no clue that this is an issue as the response ""well it is based on a truck"" so I don't expect future models to address the ride.",,Keep body style and interior and scrap the suspension entirely.
