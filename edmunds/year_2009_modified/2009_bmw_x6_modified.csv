5,Best Bimmer Ever,doctorevil1 ,03/01/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Have driven many BMWs, Porsches, etc.This is the best combo of sport, fun, function, power, looks, and exclusivity.Practical?I coach baseball and this car handles all my gear.Having had many sport sedans includeing 535, 335, etc, somehow this car handles better and feels more aggressive.Ride is comfy, but torque and turn-in are there when you want some.Cabin is like a 7 series, the environment is truly sublime on a freezing day within about 30 seconds of ignition.","Cameras, power, comfort.","Cars like this should meld with my droid for security, warmup, nav, and maintanance issues."
4.875,Life Saver,SalesAgent ,04/27/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased my 2009 BMW X6 last November and drove it all thru the winter season.  I put at least 25k miles on a year so comfort was a huge decision-maker when I decided on the X6.  No complaints other than expensive tired to replace when you get a nail in one...but they look incredible.  This vehicle did save my life as I was hit head on going 45MPH on a state highway.  While the vehicle was totaled, it held up tremendously with only a few bumps and bruises from the accident.  I will only buy BMW from this date forward.  I am currently waiting for a new BMW X6 to arrive.   ","This vehicle turns heads wherever I go...looks incredible, sounds incredible, drives incredible...no complaints.  Comfort Seats are a must as well as back-up camera...does have some blind spots.  ",The navigation system is old technology and could use an overall...maybe some better fuel economy (I average about 14 MPG & its totally worth it). 
4.375,Best car...,marrokki ,11/04/2009,,,5,5,4,3,,4,5,4,5,"This is by far the most fun car I have ever driven. Except that every 4000 miles on the dot the fuel pressure pump dies. Apparently it is a problem with CA gas additives that BMW is still trying to fix on the 3.5L engines. However even with the hassle, most dealers were quick to fix the car and get it back on the road and BMW is standing behind their car to the point of taking it back and replacing it no questions asked. That is why we love BMW.","Handling, Handling, Handling. I have never sat that high and had a car corner at 65 without spilling my coffee. I drove it across country 3 times even in blizzard conditions (I was the only one at night in a 200 mile stretch to drive over snow, everyone stopped).  ","iDrive is too slow, too complicated."
5,Awesome Performance... Awesome Looks,Had to Have the X6! ,09/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"By Far the BEST BMW I have driven yet... had two X5s and a 328ix. I got Black Sapphire on Black...loaded...The X6 3.5i has lots of power, is good looking (a real head turner), rides like a car, sportiness of a coupe, and utility of an SUV. Quality build, quality ride and a really fun to drive! Get one....it's worth it!","Loaded with the Premium Stereo, Blue Tooth with iphone is awesome and clear; shift paddles on the steering wheel; head up display. The seats are very comfortable...get the upgraded multi-contour option...well worth it on a long drive. I love everything about this car. ","Yeah, better visibility out the rear window would good; faster iDrive electronics; bigger hooks in back to hang dry cleaning; Running boards look sharp but they dirty your trousers getting in and out. "
4.75,BWM X6 35i,"Joe D, PA ",09/05/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Between my wife and I, we have owned every BMW except a Z and this vehicle is by far the most fun to drive.  Love the space and neat style. One friend after seeing it called it the batmobile.  Just picked it up yesterday and can't wait to go for a ride today. I can't image how fast the 50i must be.",Handling and ride quality.,Rear camera needs improved clarity.
4.875,Great Whatever it is,Don ,08/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Love the X6 - I think it's worth the extra $$ for the V8 - plus residuals are better and the money factors were too. Only wishes would be:  1. Manual transmission Option (Are you listening BMW!!)  2.  5th seat - middle seat in back, and 3.  Handles above seats.  I know it's supposed to be a ""coupe"" but c'mon, we need handles.   I get more ""stares"" in this rig than I did in my M6 convertible.  It surprisingly also feels faster than that vehicle.  Fun car/SUV, whatever it is I love it.","Throaty Twin Turbo V8, Exterior Styling","Manual Transmission, 5th Seat Handlebars for entering/exiting the vehicle"
4.25,Great Car - Eats Gas,KCnSprock2 ,07/30/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,2,4,"Handles really well and is extremely comfortable, with room for kids, dog and luggage. Great family car with a lot more sport than an SUV, previously had an X5 and this blows the X5 away. Downside is that it eats gas voraciously. Highly recommend for low mileage driver - not an everyday commuter car unless you like supporting the local gas station.",Like the unique look and the fact that I have yet to see another one on the road. Handling is superb.,Need to do something about blind spots and fuel efficiency.
4.875,Great All-Around Vehicle,mking ,07/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After 2 months and 2,000 miles I can say that this is the most exciting BMW I have owned.  The last two were sedans that drove great.  But, didn't have that extra factor that makes a car unique.  The X6 has that factor.  Incredible road manners, great aspect from all seating positions, incredible comfort and the best build quality in years for BMW.",Road handling and seating is exceptional.  Incredible audio system.  Back-up camera enhances rearward visibility.  Electric tailgate is a great convenience.,
4.75,X6 3.5i and 5.0i Sport,CARDEALER ,06/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"As owner of a car dealership I have the advantage of driving everything available in South Africa. So we owned a Q7 and a Range Rover Sport amongst others. We own a 2008 X6 3.5i sport and loved the driving comfort, handling and general driving pleasure so much that I just bought myself a X6 5.0i sport. For me, being a lover of sport cars, this is the real deal. It's like owning a sports car on steroids. We agree out of all cars we enjoy these two cars the most! So, wife drives one and I drive one, because not much else appeals so much. So, no matter what people say about the looks, fuel consumption and so on, go drive the thing and you will be hooked too. Happy driving!","Comfort, handling, high seat position and planted feel on any road surface. The drive is better than anything out there including X5.",Stupid gear lever. Make a 3 seater bench in the back an option for those with kids.
4.875,Lovin' it,Riccio ,06/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Wanted to get up higher in traffic for visibility so went looking at crossovers and SUVs.  Test drove the X5 and the X6.   NO CONTEST.  The X6 has sedan like handling characteristics and had better performance.  There really IS a difference between the X5's 3.0i and the X6's 3.5i.   ,"Beautiful interior, two tone nevada leather.  Love the bluetooth feature, don't know how I got along without it.  The Idrive was easy to master and helpful.  Smooth and quiet on the road.","Fuel economy of course, but my 18 mpg average probably is because of my heavy right foot - had to set the speed limit warning chime because the X6 drives so smooth it is amazingly easy to be driving VERY fast and not notice!"
4.875,"Not a ""me too"" SUV",Happy Commuter ,04/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Wanted to get into an SUV, but not one that looked like all the others.  Even the X5 reminds me of a Ford Explorer.  The X6 fits the bill in every way.  Fun to drive, great to look at, and plenty of room to haul home swap meet and mall purchases.",I LOVE the way the blue tooth works with my cell phone.  Almost forgot what it's like NOT to have it.,Better gas mileage is always a plus.  Otherwise I LOVE this car!
5,Real Excitement,Metin Kaska ,03/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I waited for one year to upgrade my car X5 to X6. We drive long distance at the weekends. We had very good time with our X5. But driving a X6 is a Real Excitement. Our car is xDrive 35d which has 6 cylinders-turbo charged diesel engine delivering 293 HP. I drive very comfortable and feeling very secure with this car due to its safety features and control systems. we like its outer design which is different than regular cars. It also has an excellent interior design. Bottom line, it was worth waiting for a year. ","Road handling, adaptive head lights, extensive safety features, sound and power of engine.",Improved rear camera. 
3,What was I thinking?,Buyer's Remorse ,03/11/2009,,,1,5,3,3,,5,4,1,2,"It is far too expensive.  Acura MDX is half the cost and, although not as fast, a better car.  I hope I grow to like it, but right now I can't help but thinking that I could have had more for so much less!!! ","No question...twin turbo.  Excellent acceleration, handling...well, just perfect driving in general.  ","Frustrating visibility, too many options and/or non-standard equipment, and...most importantly...way too expensive.  Loved it at first, but now just see it as a mistake.  "
4.875,Best Lux Crossover Out There,X6Owner ,03/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just picked up my 2009 X6 35i and am loving it. Lots of people don't understand why this vehicle exists but it has everything I personally look for in an everyday driver.  I've got utility when I need it with plenty of cargo room for a weekend ski trip, no kids yet to worry about messing up my nappa leather, physics defying handling for an SUV that must be experienced to be believed, a peppy engine that begs to be put in sport mode and thrashed, BMW quality/service/maintenance, great sound system (cool seeing your ipod tunes integrated into the audio system), the latest technology and something you won't pull up next to 5 of at the local supermarket. I can't wait to drive again in the morn!","DPC/XDrive, sport mode, 19 inch wheels, Nappa Leather, Comfort Seats, RT Traffic Nav, enough utility for me, Ipod integrated premium stereo, fat steering wheel, awesome brakes, looks aggressive from most angles, DVD changer, PDC works well, Monaco Blue Metallic paint, Bluetooth, running boards.","Rear view camera needs better resolution, better fuel economy would be ideal but it's a worthwhile compromise given the performance, allow closing of tailgate remotely, allow DVD play while driving and swivel view towards the passenger, bigger sunroof, more programmable IDrive shortcut buttons."
4.875,In A Class By Itself,Mark ,01/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Of all the xDrive BMWs I've owned or even driven, this one is a sublime blend of sure footed panther and raging bull. Fit and finish is above even BMW standards. It feels like it's hand made on the inside and looks like it was left behind by advanced intelligence from another galaxy.  Drove both engine sizes and went with the big one 5.0 V-8. The roar alone justified my decision. The slack-jaw looks it earns from the ignoratii are priceless.  Forget about cargo space. This is not for soccer moms. This is for a single individual to get out and have fun quickly. Sport package is a must on this car. So is Technology package. Logic 7 premium sound is a hedge against any conversation. Get 1",Tracks like a train on tracks,
4.875,Early review at 1240 miles,Vincento ,01/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought this car 1240 miles ago.  Best handling SUV that I've driven to date. I am 6-2, and having to drive from DC to Richmond VA at least once a week for work makes sedans and other lower riding cars tiring on my legs/back. Thus, was looking for an SUV not for cargo space or off-roading, but for the ride and seat height.  With sports package, it is a blast to drive, especially considering its height and weight. It corners better than my '06 TL, though some of it is due to the massive 20"" 315 tires on the X6. Suspension is on the firmer side, but supple enough, once again especially for an SUV. Compared against MDX, FX50, FX35, X5, ML550, narrowed down to X5 vs. X6, and picked this.","Handling, speed, and that BMW trade mark engine note. Logic7 is not the best but still in the top tier. Looks -  I, just like all the others passing by, stop in front of the car and smile everyday.","Build quality: driver side vanity mirror light is already out. Navigation: one of the worst nav units I've used, and I've used at least 6 different kinds. Slow and inefficient route selection.  Computer: generally quite slow as you navigate through the menus. IPod: interface is analog."
