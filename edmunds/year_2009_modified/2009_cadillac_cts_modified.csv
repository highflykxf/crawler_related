5,Great car to own with reservations....,tman ,08/07/2016,3,4,5,,,3,4,5,5,,,This 2009 cadillac cts is the most comfortable car i have ever owned period!  If you are purchasing this car look into an extended warranty cause the transmission input/output shaft will require attention...  It is an expensive repair as well depending on where you go for service.  Mine just set me back $2600.00 dollars to get the car right.  I also had the key swtich go on the sterring wheel cost me another $400.00 bucks.  I now feel that the car is finally right after all the money i put into it.  This car owns the road once you are on it with this vehicle.. But please look into an extended warranty of some type if you buy it.,,

5,"Great Car to Own, But distructive side air bags!",Craig ,05/12/2016,5,5,5,,,5,4,5,4,,,"We loved this car and it and would recommend owning it to others. It is a great feeling, handling and looking car. The fuel economy and value far exceed expectations.  BUT if your side airbags deploy like ours did when a pair of deer ran into the side of the car, the interior of the vehicle virtually self-distructs in a live saving role and totals the vehicle interior with 5K to 6 K in damage plus labor including locking down the seat and seat belts, and that is without deployment of front airbags. The side impact we recieved left the car both driveable and the doors openable but dented and knocked out the front head light. But the side air bag deployment essentially made a case for Total Loss in insurance on vehicle with no frame, engine, electrical, power train or other auto body damage.  3500 in exterior parts and labor to fix the exterior but 12,500 in damage from the side airbags deploying. Please someone remove the hair trigger on the side airbags!",,

4,Great Car for the Price,Greg ,03/11/2016,5,3,4,,,5,5,4,4,,,"I purchased my 2009 CTS in 2013 with 69,000 miles on it at the time.  I drive the car daily (40 miles or so), cross country twice (2000+ miles each time), and frequently on road trips of 200 miles or more.  It handles well on the highway and the ride is smooth.  Cabin is spacious and quiet for an older vehicle, and comfortably seats me and three others.  I have not had any problems with the car mechanically though I frequently ride it hard and put it away wet.  Since it hit 75,000 miles I've been changing the oil every 7,000 miles and using nothing but Valvoline High Mileage Full Synthetic.  The engine is powerful and it will outrun most sedans on the road, both 0-60 and in top speed... believe me, I've done it.  The only electrical issue the car had was in the headlight wiring harness, which had a plug rust out due to a leak in the passenger side headlight.  I attempted replacing the headlights first, believing the issue was in the passenger side light itself, but when both stock and aftermarket replacements (don't ever buy them, they are terrible and not nearly as bright as stock) continued to have issues, I tracked the problem to the harness.  $114.00 was the total cost and it took me about an hour and a half to install (I know very little about this kind of stuff).  Not bad if you ask me.  The car now has 114,556 on it and still runs, shifts, and takes the corners like it did when I first got it.   I live off a pretty windy road, and at night when traffic is non-existent, I enjoy taking the ""20 MPH MAX"" corners at 60+.  This car sticks around the bends and makes me confident enough to sling it back and forth with ease.  Only other change I made was the addition of 4 new tires (cost $800) at 100,000 miles (still had factory rubber up until then) and wiper blades every 2 years or so.  As of right now factory breaks still pass state inspection, as does everything else.  I am very satisfied with how this car drives.  I only wish it had a few more features on it, but it's a base model so I digress.  Total cost in 2013 for the car was $19,995, and I've put probably less than $1500 into it in my time owning it.  I'm happy with that.  One last thing.  Was at a dead stop and got rear ended by a Camry traveling in excess of 40 MPH.  I drove away from that scene with nothing but moderate rear end damage, and a bent exhaust pipe (his insurance paid $7,400 for complete repairs including an entire new exhaust system, rear bumper, trunk lid, and tail lights).  The Camry's engine was literally sitting on the ground.  Sorry fellas, but American steel still beats Japanese plastic.",,

2,2009 Cadillac CTS AWD 3.6DI - all options,LV ,01/08/2016,1,2,3,,,2,4,4,4,,,"I have owned a 2003 Toyota Corolla S (bought new until 22k when totaled), 1997 Nissan Maxima Se (used 94k, sold at 170k), 2005 Scion tc (new and sold at 177k) those three vehicles were maintain and had little to no major repairs.  I sold the Scion tc and purchased a used 2009 Cadillac CTS with all factory options at 75k miles.  The vehicle seemed well maintained inside, out, and mechanically.  I had purchased it from a reputable BMW dealership for $18k.  Here are the things that have gone wrong with the car. 1. Right Rear Knuckle bushing needs replacing (audible knocking sound over all bumps) *warranty2. Front right wheel bearing needed to be replaced. *warranty3. Rear left wheel bearing needed to be replaced.  *out of warranty $528.004. ECM needed replacement * out of warranty $1100 5. Driveshaft needed replacement (1st time) *1200 6. Timing chains needed to be replaced around 108k *warranty under GM 120k warranty specifically for this problem otherwise a $2300 cost 7. Door handle sensor needed to be replaced on passenger door *$5758. Auxillary water pump needed replacement $250.9. Purge Valve needed replacement $50 part  did it myself very easy to replace 10. Driveshaft failed for 2nd time, needed replacement  $1200. 11. Drains for water had seeped into trunk compartment wetting all the electronics near battery.  Dealership couldn't find out what the issue is, i figured it out through a forum where other CTS owners have had similar issues.  *free since fixed on my own. 12. Driveshaft failed for 3rd time, needed replacement (covered under parts warranty) 13. Driverside catalytic converter failed needed replacement *$1250 14. CD/DVD player stopped working *decided not to fix it. otherwise $750.15. Bluetooth for phone works intermittently, doesn't always pick up calls and does always hang them up.  *just dealing with it 16. power lumbar seat failed and no longer works * just dealing with it otherwise $513 to fix 17. Front left wheel bearing. $528.This car was a HUGE disappointment, being it was my first luxury vehicle.  Granted I bought it with 75k, i made sure full tune up was performed along with all the fluids changed (transmission, differential, transfer case, coolant) when i first purchased the vehicle.  Things have failed on this car that do not fail on reliable manufactures.   I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER GM VEHICLE EVER AGAIN.  ESPECIALLY A CADILLAC.  Next vehicle will be a Lexus, or even hate to say the new Genesis or Equus look good and have good reliability ratings.  Too bad I really wanted to support an American brand.   My car was service at Englewood Cadillac in NJ and Brogan Cadillac in Totowa, NJ.   They know me by first name at both places because my car has been in there so much, along with other customers I tend to see every now and again.  Lots of problems, everyone i know with a used Cadillac has a horrible experience with them.  SO DISSATISFIED WITH THIS CAR, PLEASE DO NOT BUY ONE.",,

1,2009 CTS,Joan David ,07/30/2015,1,2,2,,,1,2,2,2,,,"Sharp but expensive to repair which I have had to do frequently. Also, headlight problems and hard to get any support with a recalled wiring harness which now they are trying to say it's discontinued maybe to avoid covering the cost on a recalled item? My advice, sell the car quickly and never buy another one. That is exactly my next move. I have had this car five years and thought after I paid it off it would last another five years. WRONG! Can't afford the repairs and hoping I can get rid of it. Just had to replace timing chain at 160000---surprised I even had to do this at all. Too much money invested I just have to keep driving and hope it last long enough without another major repair. Still unhappy with car. I will never buy another American made car.",,

The 09 CTS is a nice car, looks very nice from the outside, has a respectable interior also. I wish I took a closer look at the Audi, BMW, and possibly the infiniti. My mom has a G37 which is a nicer car in my opinion. The CTS does have the image of being expensive if that is important to you. The car is very heavy but despite its weight, it is very nimble. I feel it could have a few more horses but it can pick up speed pretty well. The Gas mileage is horrible but it does take the 87 octane which is nice.

2.875,Should have bought another truck,fordman ,08/16/2010,,,4,5,1,1,,3,2,4,3,"The last time I bought a GM product was 2004 and after three transmissions, swore I would never buy another. In an effort to help the US auto industry, I decided to try again. The transmission in the caddy has been slipping since purchase. The original diagnosis was a computer issue and some shims. The problem has progressed and we are headed back to the dealer again. The radio/NAV went out after 15,000 miles and brakes were replaced after a recall. Overall, the car looks good especially from the exterior. However, for nearly $50,000, I would have hoped for a car I could rely on. This ain't it!",Good looks.

4.875,First Time Cadillac Owner,JohnC ,07/31/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This was my first upscale car, and I've not been disappointed.  Great look & feel inside & out, superior driving experience (even with base 3.6 engine).   Bold exterior design and black cherry color has drawn lots of compliments.  Mileage is about as expected, 17-19 mpg in mostly city driving.  Seems pretty good to me for an AWD car.  Like one other reviewer, I had major transmission problem about 3 mos into ownership, which eventually required total replacement and about 2 wks in the dealership.  However, dealer handled great, provided free loaner CTS for the entire time, so what's to complain about?  No problems since.  Overall a great vehicle and certainly the best car I've ever owned.","Exterior & interior styling, great overall driving experience.  Analog clock is a classy touch.  Integrated Bluetooth & iPod connection are super-convenient - I suppose most cars will have eventually, but nice to be leading the pack.","As many have noted, rear visibility is poor, backing out of a parking space requires a lot of attention.

I never thought about it at the time of purchase but I do now! I paid almost $40,000 for this car and at 15,500 miles the plastic upholstery on the drivers seat is already starting to stretch and fray. I'm not a big person at 165 lb. So it's not my size thats the problem its the cheap plastic crap they used for the seat covering. Not a bit of leather on these seats at all. What ever you do don't settle for anything less than leather. Remember Cadillac guarantee doesn't cover your upholstery. Gm should be out of business settling for this cheap upholstery material for a cad.",Does anyone look at these? especially the Cadillac division of GM. Also new buyers also., Put real leather on the seats and not this plastic crap. For the price of a Cadillac leather seats are expected! Doors should be completely flush with each other when closed.

It is truly a world-class car, and GM & Cadillac should be justifiably proud. They have produced a distinctively American entry level luxury sedan with performance, style, and quality. There is no reason to add the phrase ""for an American car"" when comparing it to Euro or Japanese competitors. It's vehicles like the CTS that are critical to GM's recovery.","Ride quality, performance, distinctive exterior styling, and first-class interior styling. Corners ferociously.

4.75,My first Cadillac,Ltdc ,08/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,I must say that so far it has been a mostly pleasant experience. I have the red CTS and it does draw it share of raves from family and strangers. One draw back I noticed immediately was the width of the A pillars in conjunction with the side view mirrors makes for a sizable blind spot. Backing the car up is a bit of a guessing game since you can't see the rear deck. You can't count on the computer to give accurate gas mileage readings. On the instant readout the mileage jumps all over the place including into the 40 + mpg range. The average MPG was showing 30.2 at 65 MPH without the AC on. If it was really getting that kind of mileage I think it would have been show on the EPA estimate. ,The overall impression of the cabin makes for a pleasant driving experience. The ambient lighting is a nice touch. You do have to have the dash lights set to bright to fully appreciate it. You can get used to the XM radio without the advertisements and useless banter. ,"Reduced blind spots. The 2 cup holders end up used for storage since they are in a storage area with a cover. A fold down rear seat. The cargo net is high and gets in the way when placing items in the trunk. A light in the engine compartment. Front cowl is 4 1/4"" off ground. Should be fun in snow."

4.75,Lives Up to the Hype,BlockDaddy21 ,07/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"With the automotive world giving such panegyrical reviews to this car, I figured it surely must be a ploy to get us to stimulate the economy and buy American. Prior to my '09 CTS, I owned a 2008 Acura TL Type-S that was my absolute favorite car. However, I drove the CTS, and it was all over. My 3.6 DI AWD is a real driver's car; it gives great feedback to the driver, corners like it's on rails, the brakes are phenomenal, and it has admirable throttle response. Not to mention great style!  Overall build quality is great - no complaints in the first 7000 miles.  I would recommend that anyone in the market check out the CTS among the typical mix of imports - you'll be pleasantly surprised.","Overall handling, interior styling, *Fast* GPS, iPod integration, braking, AWD system, adaptive front lighting, UltraView sunroof... just an amazing car!","More POIs in the Navi, quieter cabin (although not bad as-is), more supportive seats for those of us with (ahem) wider seats."

The steering feel, ride, and all the features for the price are hard to beat. On top of that, Caddy has a signature style with this car that sets it apart in looks and handling.  That said, there are still some quality issues they need to address.  There were some paint issues (underspray), a shaky side mirror, and creaks.  Nothing too bad but these things should not take place on any car of this class.  I would tell anyone to check out CTS before buying an import.  This car has it all.","Pop up Nav, power everything, ambient lighting, power, highway ride. Almost everything is great.  Oh, and stereo too, wow, very nice.","Quieter interior, better seats (they don't hug you but ended up being comfortable), better paint job, less rattles and squeaks.  "

5,The Best Choice for an All Around Sedan,John C. ,07/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My prior two cars were 2002 & 2006 Lexus LS-430 sedans. I established a decision criteria to keep it objective. I checked out Lexus LS/GS, Mercedes E, Jaguar XF, Infinity M, BMW 3/5, Lincoln MKS, Geneses, Audi4/6 & Acura TL. In the end, the BMW 535 and the Cadillac CTS stood out. We also own a BMW (& 4 before it).  The ride/handling was about the same. Styling was aggressive versus classic. Seating was similar. Cost over three years was insignificant. The difference was the way the cars are actually equipped.  BMW offers most of the same options, but they are not reasonably available. Ease of use was also big factor.  Even my BMW driving wife agreed, the CTS was the best total choice.","Styling, fit & finish, GPS with OnStar with split screen including ease of use, air cooled seats (I live in AZ), fold-down rear seat, sound system, diagnostic system with real-time information, monthly reporting, dash board, superb ride and handling and acceleration. The dealer was the best also.","I miss the rear-view camera from my Lexus, but the sensor system is acceptable.  Combination driving achieves 23/24 mpg.  Although that is still ok, more is better in this case."

5,GM's hard at work,kwbaron ,12/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"These are concerns expressed on this blog that no longer exist in this vehicle. Flash to pass is on this vehicle and it works with the HID high beams, I believe an industry first.  Bluetooth is standard.  It is now impossible to step on the brake and gas pedal at the same time. There is a single address book for the Bluetooth, navigation and OnStar systems. I compaired this vehicle to a Infinity 37x, Acura TL, and Lexus GS 350.  All are excellent vehicles. Only the CTS DI AWD has the interior luxury of the Lexus (done in the distinctly GM style), the performance and efficiency of the direct injection engine (it runs on regular gas) and handling characterics of a European sedan.","Microsoft's integration of navigation, Bluetooth and Onstar.  Fully fold down rear seat (unavailable in the Lexus GS350 or the Acura TL). Efficiency of DI which increases performance and still runs on regular (unavailable in the Acura TL, Infinity G37x, or Lexus 350 GS). GM Red Tag pricing.","It's too early to tell but if vehicle turns out to be as reliable as my Yukon XL, my Buick Park Avenue, and my Acura Legend, this will be the best vehicle I've every purchased."

4.875,First American car ever in 16 years,cts fan ,12/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have had Toyota, Honda, Honda, Mini, Scion, VW and Honda.  This is my first upgrade into the luxury category and I was thinking of a Lexus until I drove my new CTS. This car has it all.  Looks, design, comfort, fun factor, reliability and safety.  And did I mention looks!. I absolutely love it so far. It is just amazing.","Hard drive for music files. Heated-cooled seats, OnStar, navigation, and the best is the pop up nav screen.","Should come with a spare tire for a 51k sticker price. Give me a break. But, that is my only gripe. I ordered the spare tire kit.  "

4.875,One of the Best Sports Sedans Made!,PJR ,12/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The '09 CTS is an absolutely fantastic car!  I compared it to BMW, Audi, and Mercedes and liked the CTS best - no contest.  You give up nothing at all, and the car is significantly less expensive than its rivals.  Fit/finish, ride, handling, power, comfort and features are all 1st rate.  Unlike some of the imports, this car fits both taller drivers (I'm 6'5"") and shorter drivers (my wife is 5'3"") very comfortably. It's really quiet on the road - no wind noise, squeaks, or rattles. The DI engine is responsive, powerful, and runs on regular gas. I frequently get comments from friends and co-workers: ""You bought a what?!?""  Then when I show it to them they say ""Oh, now I get it. Great car!""","Fantastic all-around car lacks nothing!  Handling and responsiveness make it fun to drive.  Interior is among the best in the business. Integration between navigation, audio, OnStar, and hands-free phone is great. The hard-drive audio system eliminates the clutter of CDs in the car.","If you are really tall, then you probably already know not to get the sunroof, as this takes away nearly 2 inches of headroom.  I would like to see GM remove the sunroof from their option packages and make it a stand-alone option.  Navigation system response time to driver commands should be faster."

5,Really like this car 6 months later.,Jake Spranerts ,12/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Straight through the gas spike crisis, this car managed approx 21MPG pretty hard driving. The vehicle tracks incredibly on the highway and might have the best overall feel of any car we purchased including nearly every foreign brand.","Standard V-6 is outstanding. No need for the DI, save the money because the speed and power of standard is plenty offering solid MPG. Seat comfort and night interior lighting are excellent.  ","For safety, mandatory missing backup sensors. Come on GM that has to be standard on Cadillac. We absolutely love this car and shockingly can't come up with any complaints!"

4.875,Rivals the Germans,jaxattax ,11/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Absolutely love this car! Like most, I thought luxury came in the form a German automobile. This car changes all notions. Never considered a car from GM before, however, I am absolutely thrilled with this purchase.","My commute is mostly highway, therefore, I appreciate the interior creature comforts and responsiveness of this auto.","Push button start, standard."

4.875,Dream turned reality.,Jacob K ,11/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a wonderful car. I saved for three years to purchase this car and thankfully I waited for the redesign in 08. The exterior is aggressive and looks beautiful. The interior is superb. Second to none in terms of interior fit and finish. I love the stitching of the leather seats, and the sepele wood accents make all the difference in terms of lux factor. I wish I would have upped to the nav system/upgraded stereo however. The double wide sun roof is great for the people in the back as well. It really makes all the difference in a car purchase when you can walk up to your car and smile every time. Being super young and being priviledged enough to drive a Caddy is a dream come true for me.","I love the wood accents. The leather stitching is unique, which is great. Double wide sun roof really opens up the car and I can't complain about the performance either. Definitely has enough get up and go to make the quick merge onto freeway traffic and enough braking power to stop quick if needed.","The material that covers the sunroof is unacceptable! Are you kidding me Cadillac!? Garbage. I'm an audiophile, and the Bose in nothing special. Really dissapointed in that. And the fact that the P, R, N, D and the M + - don't light up on the shifter really irks me at night time. Terrible decision."

4.875,At last!,gunorthopod ,11/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"At last, a car that meets and exceeds all my expectations. Previous car was a 2007 Mercedes CLS 550. Thirty nine days in the shop the first 14 months. Problems with faulty navigation, multiple creaks, rattles, and vibrations, AC blower motor defective, and catastrophic power failure twice. Transmission needed to be replaced.I engineered a lemon law buyback fortunately. I looked at Lexus and BMW but was enthralled by the CTS. What a car! Perfect fit and finish with more advanced electronics than MB. Everything works as described. More than adequate power with superlative handling and acceleration. The only thing I gave up was a one half second 0 to 60 time. GM and Cadillac have produced a world class car.  ",Navigation which is intuitive with touch screen. Shifter with sport and competition modes. Ambient lighting ,Seats could have more lateral support.

4.875,Great Car!,Edward ,11/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I purchased the 09 CTS to replace my 07 Infiniti. Prior to that I drove an 06 Infiniti and 03 BMW 5 series. The CTS is every bit as good and has better styling & ride. The performance and technology matches & surpasses my previous cars and the price was right. Cadillac has built a first class car that can compete with anyone.   ,"Great handling, styling, and the high tech options are much more advanced than any previous cars I've owned. ","With the restrictive rear view, the CTS really needs a back-up camera."

4.5,Competing with the Germans!,MK ,11/10/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,4,5,4,5,"I have owned many many cars, mostly German and some Japanese luxury brands, this CTS is my first US luxury sedan in 25 years! It certainly competes well with all those brands, but with all the incentives and employee pricing, value ratio was the best of them all. In fact, I traded in my 2008 BMW 335i twin-turbo coupe shortly after for another car!","Styling, interior space and features, solid driving feel, affordability.","Interior fit and finish require more attention, squeeling noises and front panel speaker covers were off place. Bluetooth should be standard for driving safety."

5,"CTS 09 FOR $39,000 Is Outstanding!",Darren Cimino ,10/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Folks, GM/Cadillac is offering incredible cash back pricing on the CTS.   I was able to load up fully and remain under 40 Grand.  Cannot believe BMW or Mercedes is not having a heart attack over this American car.  Absolutely love this vehicle running on regular gasoline!","MPG is Good approx 21 combined hard driving.  Regular gasoline, A/C seats, outrageous audio/nav system.   Steering is on par with Germans yet service light remains Off unlike Mercedes Service Engine Soon light on literally every other month.",Zero.  Could not be happier with a purchased auto.

4.875,Very Happy,traderj ,10/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Made an unbelievable deal for the base model with GMS pricing (which is still available on the '09 base model), Lease Loyalty Cash, Bonus Cash (for paying cash), Rebates and GM Card rewards. Paid only 64% of MSRP. This is an attractive car inside and out. It is enjoyable to drive. A solid, but not harsh, ride. I am 5'10 165 lbs. and I think the seats are very comfortable.  I could see where someone larger than me would think that the seats might be too narrow. Also rear headroom is limited to 6' adults. Rear visibility is very limited. This is my biggest knock against this car. But many cars I test drove had this same problem. Overall very happy!'","Handling and ride, attractive inside and out, good radio, uses regular gas!",Push button start and rear back-up sensors must be standard in a Cadillac.

5,Not Grandma's Caddy,Melinda ,10/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was looking at BMW, Mercedes, and Audi when I settled on the CTS. The quality of the interior and layout is far superior. The car is very sporty too. I get lots of compliments on it. The car doesn't need premium gas which is a huge plus. The voice activated command is nice and works well. Besides my 2005 Corvette, this is the first domestic car I've purchased in over 20 years. I have high expectations for my CTS and have not been disappointed.","Overall look both inside and out, ambiance lighting, large sunroof, ventilated seats, Bluetooth, and Nav/sound system combo.",The floor mats are incredibly cheap for a car this polished! I replaced those immediately.  Please add a backup camera.  Maybe shed a few pounds to improve performance.

5,Phenomenal Ride,Ed Bauzenberger ,10/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Prior to my purchase of this outstanding motor vehicle, I owned a 2003 and then a 2005 Escalade. No vehicle that I have ever purchased even comes close to matching the 2009 CTS! This includes vehicles like Mercedes Benz and Audi. This CTS is absolutely pure fun to drive, gives a feeling of confidence in all driving situations and is extremely beautiful inside and out. People have come up to me and told me that they think that it is one gorgeous automobile.","Everything including heated & cooled seats, navigation system, On Star, Hard Drive memory, Bluetooth & satellite radio.",Rear View Camera

5, CTS AWD (A W-icked D-rive),C B ,10/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Because I'm from the North, that is, it snows here in winter, AWD was a necessity for me. When I was looking for a new ride I tried them all. To be fair, I looked at all AWD cars similarly equipped. So, in searching, I found: IS250 (no guts-204HP, no glory). G35X, too much $$$ when you add the Sport pkg, wasn't impressed much except for the exhaust note. M-B C300-4Matic, too much $$, period! BMW 3or5 X anything, ditto. One minute behind the wheel of the CTS, the choice was clear. Motor Trend Car of the Year, need I say more? When you add the Cadillac Care program and warranty items like a free loaner, free maintenance, etc. End story! Anyone saying bad stuff about this car needs help, fast. ","What's not to like! Nav system, french leather dash, Heated/cooled seats, steerable headlights, Bose sound system, 300+ horses, AWD, keyless start, the list goes on. My Thunder Gray CTS is one of the most interesting colors I've ever seen. I now know why Chip Foose would spend extra on paint, WoW!","Interior storage, maybe, but only if it's for a sleeping bag, cause I ain't getting out. My wife misses me, or at least that's what she says when she calls me on the Onstar Hands-Free;-) Is it wrong to love your car? But seriously, areas for improvement are very hard to find, actually, impossible."

5,A Truly Terrific Car !,MJLx2 ,09/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car has it all. GREAT styling inside and out, fantastic handling and outstanding build quality. Fun to drive quotient is off the charts! I've driven my new CTS approx 2,200 miles in both suburban / expressway as well as an 800 mile highway driving. AWD glues the car to the road, yet provides a comfortable ride without sacrificing feel for the road. And, it's a head turner to be sure. Not a creak, squeak or rattle - this car is tight! My previous car was a Lexus ES330 and before that an Acura TL. Before buying I test drove Acura, Lexus and BMW's. The CTS is by far and away the best vehicle in it's class! Highly recommend the AWD and direct injection 304 HP options. Kudos Cadillac & GM!","Performance, handling, comfortable controlled ride yet with great road feel, interior / exterior design, gauge lay-out, AWD, 22 mpg suburb / expressway and 29 mpg highway on regular gas.  Blue tooth, On-Star with driving directions feature. Leather interior stitched by Coach. One very solid car.",A very small item - foot pedal to rest left foot could be a bit higher.

5,This car will save GM,Larry ,09/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Drove from Indianapolis to Vail and back.  I encountered every conceivable weather condition except snow --sunshine, rain, and even hail; high buffeting winds and still air; temperatures from the 40's to the 90's. Indianapolis is 500 feet above sea level.  Vail pass is 10,200 feet. I kept the cruise at 77/78, except in Colorado, where I found it easier to drive with the cruise off. The car is so smooth, quiet, and comfortable that I frequently found myself doing 90 when I was not using the cruise. The A/C was flawless in the 90 degree sun, and the cooled seats were wonderful. The drive was almost like playing a video game from my easy chair. I got 26.3 mpg going west and 27.1 returning east.","Very comfortable seats, automatic temperature control (including heated & cooled seats) for driver AND passenger, suspension, automatic transmission, quiet smooth ride, keyless entry & ignition, steering wheel controls, memory seat, and did I mention very comfortable seats.","Offer employee pricing before I buy, not after."

4.875,2009 Cadillac CTS,Ms. Stone ,08/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Took possession of a new 09 CTS 3 days ago. Chose it over an Infiniti M45X and hoped I would not regret it. So far, so good. This car is a beautiful automobile and fun to drive. I have Black Cherry color and it is loaded with the performance package.Controls are easy to understand much like the 06 Cadillac DTS that I just sold. As far as reliability, I can't comment because I have only had it 3 days. I love driving this car and do not regret going to a 6 cylinder from the 8 cylinders that I have always driven. Way to go Cadillac!

Waited for the 2009 for resale value purposes as they weren't really dropping any solid incentives on the 2008.   So far we are completely happy with the car.,Love the A/C seats which activate on remote startup to cool the entire car off in hot summer sun.   Steering wheel feel and feedback is excellent.  Seats are much more comfortable than standard BMW offerings.,"Rear headroom is slightly low but that would be nitpicking beyond belief.  Overall 110% satisfied, and nobody had to call me on phone prior to us telling you that.  "

To start with I have driven BMW's before and like them, but they are expensive and don't look as good in my opinion.  I got the fully loaded DI with the summer performance package.  This car is amazing.  It is amazingly agile and has lots of room.  The car stands out as very bold and the interior look, fit and finish is first rate.  Much better looking on the interior than a BMW or Mercedes.  The electronics are great and a lot of fun and I have to say I have never been in a car more elegant at night than the CTS.  The lighting is amazing.  ","Navigation, remote start, cooled seats, built in hard drive, Sound system, feel of the leather, bluetooth, steering feel, solidity, and road feel.  Oh yeah, the lighting both inside and out.",Back up camera and that's about it.
