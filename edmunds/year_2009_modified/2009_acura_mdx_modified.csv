5,The Golden Retriever of Luxury SUV's,Aaron ,09/27/2016,4,5,4,,,4,5,4,4,,,"This is our first ACURA after previously coming from a Honda Odyssey.  The Reliability has been very good. No Major failures, and never left us on the road. Only one repair done under warranty, a right front wheel bearing.  All else has been standard service work.  Not the cheapest to maintain but not BMW outrageous either.   Gas mileage has been below expected at just about 16.5mpg for mostly city use, but the handling and power make it kinda hard not to goose it a bit! Speaking of handling, the SH-AWD is awesome, you can tell when the torque vectoring is taking place, but it's not obtrusive, in fact it's kinda of addicting to engage it.  Fun, fun, fun to drive especially on any winding road.  Plenty of interior room for our family of 4 and large dog for multiple 1000 mile + trips.  Overall excellent ownership experience and most likely will be a repeat MDX buyer.",,

3,"235,000 miles",Shandu ,08/24/2015,3,4,3,,,3,4,4,3,,,"There is a common electrical issue.  From the first 3000 miles there was a short in the radio meaning, when it get hot the sound would skip like a turn table skipping.  The XM radio, CD player, AM/FM and DVD player sound would skip.  Took it to several dealership from Long Island, Manhattan, and Westchester Acura.  No one could find the reason, each saying to return the car at the time that the sound is skipping.  Replace the first battery within one year.  Twice the battery was dead within six months.  Second time, dealer replace under warranty.  Third time, the discharge of the battery even though the vehicle was off cause my a/c compressor to blow.  The dealer said that the unit was drawing power even though it was off.  The pressure build to the point where it cause the unit to blow.  Dealer replace the battery and the A/C relay.  Also the constant drain on the battery which maybe linked to the HLF/blue tooth system.  I had to disconnect the HLF/blue took system.  Gas mileage is very weak.  Average about  15 miles per gallon on high way, due to heavy foot.  Keep in mind I travel at least 160 miles per day.  Yes, gas prices are high but I love my MDX.  It corners like a dream at 65-70 mph on a curvy two lane country road.   I am 6'1"" and sit very well In my captain seat.  The second row is hard to move forward for rear entry into the third row.  Michelin Tires are the best so far in terms of gas saving and road noise.  Have changed the following, tire road, oil plan, a/c relay switch, 3 battery on my fourth.   Wanted to be the owner who reaches over 500,000 miles but it will be expensive.",,

Another 2 month, gas door wouldn't keep close (replaced under warranty). Another 6 months into ownership and drive side window wouldn't open (window motor bad).

I bought a pre-owned 2009 MDX w/Technology package in black with black interior.  I knew I wanted an SUV mid-size and looked at several.

It has a great ride, ample storage, terrific acceleration and handles like a sports sedan.  I was considering the Audi, but the Audi's handling does not even come close to the Acura.  The BMW handled well but was now where near as luxurious or comfortable.  MPG are quite reasonable considering the performance of the engine.  I've had the vehicle for 9 months now and have had zero maintenance issues.  If you're looking for a fantastic luxury SUV, look no further.","SH-AWD, Stereo is the best I've heard, Smooth ride and acceleration.","Could use a push button starter and blind spot recognition, but that's trivial compared to the overall vehicle positives."

5,The Ususal Well Built Honda,acurahappy ,04/08/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Have owned two Honda's before the MSX, and have been happy with the reliability of both vehicles. Was looking for another SUV, but more upscale from my 94 explorer. All the other stuff out there didn't appeal to me or was too expensive. Since I have had the mdx (sept. 09) I am completely happy with my purchase. The ride is very comfortable and quiet. Has been a pleasure to drive in the city, long trips and in the mountains. The all wheel drive system makes it handle very well on turns of windy roads. My mileage in the city has averaged 18-19 mpg, and up to 25 on the hwy. Impressive for a 300 hp motor. I like the style. Don't mind the ""beak"" in front. It gives it its character. A lot of car for the money.  ","Sh-awd system. Separate ac/heat/thermostat controls for the back. The ability to roll the Windows down with the remote is great on hot days when the car has been sitting closed up in the sun. Storage in back behind 3rd seat. One touch open and close on the sun roof, and with key off. Too much to list.","Key fob/switchblade too big. Prefer push button start, or separate key like old days. Back window separate from the lift gate. Used a lot on the explorer. Did it with the pilot, and should have followed suit with the mdx. Separate compartments in the center console. Nothing major needed, all is good."

3.625,"Overall, a great vehicle",Yoshodeep ,02/14/2010,,,4,4,3,4,,4,4,2,4,"Having driven the car around town as well as some long trips, I am satisfied with the vehicle. 3rd row seating works fine, albeit not for tall people by any means. Nice pick up. More spacious than I thought from the outside. SH-AWD works great in slick snowy condition. I bought the base pkg, and the sound quality is plenty good. Leather seats are not at par with BMW standards. Bluetooth is somewhat cumbersome (voice recognition only). Can't say enough about the leg and shoulder rooms enough. It is fun to drive, from the SUV perspective. At this price, expected scheduled free maintenance though. Overall one of the best buys in the segment.","Front and rear legroom and climate control, peppy pick up, storage, price","Interior build quality (check how BMW does it's leather seats), Simpler Bluetooth, better gas mileage (should be at least 3 mpg more than it currently is).

4.875,What a machine,Myron Yorks ,01/05/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,The MDX is truely a SUV with excellent handling and is fun to drive. I've had the MDX for one month and yet to find anything that requires me to go back to the dealer for. The craftsmanship is something else. I would highly recommend the MDX. I have no regrets with my purchase. My wife and I have driven our new MDX to the coast twice over the past month and it handles so good thru all the twist and turns on highway 1. What a awesome ride. Yet it is still a family SUV. The MDX is the complete package. ,The sport handling AWD system really gives the MDX a edge over all other Mid size suv's. Also the sound system really rocks. The sound system is so clear at all volumes. What a system. ,Would be nice to have Right &  Left blind spot sensors.

Handling is fantastic. Seating excellent. Controls easy to use. Cost to own seems relatively strong in Edmunds. We will have to wait and see. After two years, this automobile should have 6 speed transmission. Looks like 2010 will finally have one. When I found out it had build parts in Canada, wanted to turn it back in to the dealer!

Once I had to get it towed to dealership. First time I was told that they was issue with poor quality Timing belt pulley. So timing belt got shredded. They had to replace them both. They took almost week to replace it. Within a day, 2009 MDX developed issue. This time there was an issue with Catalytic converter. They took another week to replace. Again within two days, ""Check emission system"" came up again. This time I was told they would have to replace another catalytic converter and also sub converters. This is putting a big question mark on Acura products. Quality?",The Navigation system is good. But not sure how long it will work.,It would be good if the quality of Acura products is improved.

4.875,New and nice,fishin8tor ,12/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Only had the car for two weeks, but really like all the features, especially the way this car customizes everything from the drivers seat, ac, and keyless memory system.  Steering is accurate and direct on center, but took some time to get used to as used to drive a Odyssey.  Power is soft at first, but comes on strong when you push it.  Love the transmission and shifter as it is quick on the shifts and doesn't hesitate like other systems.  The SH-AWD is kinda neat, and haven't used it but once in a turn, but it's nice to have and gives great confidence when driving.  Mileage on is 20 on trip to bay area, and city seems around 16.  So far, so good!  I am looking forward to years of driving.","Keyless memory, power, steering, rear ac for rear, shifter.",More hooks in back.

4,Best out there in its class [for now],tastycakes ,11/30/2009,,,5,4,4,4,,4,5,3,3,"Buying the MDX felt like an arranged marriage, not true love. For cargo storage, vehicle size, functionality, AWD and price compared to competitors, the MDX is great. But driving...well I don't know who said this is a fun drive.  5-spd tranny feels dated and sluggish to accelerate.  Feel disconnected from the road more so than other CUVs.  Lacks features like keyless entry/ignition, blind spot monitoring.  Leather seems cheap compared to all competitors.  Fuel economy disappointing at 14 mpg (80% highway) after 3 tanks. Lacks small touches in design - example is doors feel light and flimsy when closed.  Chose MDX over CX-9 for the badge but have been feeling regret since purchase.","SH-AWD, usable 3rd row, excellent storage, bluetooth, efficient rear climate, aggressive exterior styling.","More standard features like blind spot monitoring, power liftgate, keyless entry, rearview camera.

I originally went out looking to buy a Toyota Highlander, thinking that was the only SUV that was in my price range, but the deals on the MDX have been crazy so I could easily justify the $5 more I spent on the MDX.  This car has everything I wanted.  The SH-AWD is awesome, the luxurious interior is really comfortable and has a ton of features and tech (I got the tech package).  The voice recognition is way better than my BMW I used to have and it drives much more like a sports car than the RX.

The Bluetooth for my phone sometimes works but most of the time, I have to take my calls from the cell phone directly as the calls do not get through.  After paying so much money for this MDX, it is disappointing to be having so many problems.

The electronic features are first rate, but tend to be quite complicated and I am very technically oriented.","This SUV desperately needs STANDARD back-up sensors. When the back-up camera isn't blinded by sunlight, the camera is very deceptive. When you are parallel parking, the car behind looks 10 ft away, when you are really 1 ft away.

Electrical issues, and a Transmission issue, and some others....and the power/acceleration is very mediocre (300hp?? Yeah, right!), and the ENGINE is VERY NOISY and unrefined when accelerating!!!

Have been to 3 different ones and they're all unprofessional -- and crooks to boot!  Today I took the MDX in and apparently the brakes went out at 25000 miles. Fog/DTL light cover had melted from heat and they told me the exhaust from someone backing up real close must have done it -- unbelievable!  Acura cust svc is just as bad.  I have a Lexus too-the service experience and reliability is in a whole diff. league.","Honda tried to build a ""luxury"" brand -- they have failed miserably.

My only real gripe is that the few problems I have had, have been dealt with poorly. The service departments of the Acura dealers are well below par, in fact they are poor.

Also, I have the worst time getting my hands free link to recognize certain numbers. Sometimes I will have to say the number 4 like 5 times before it will actually dial the correct number.

I have managed as much as 28 MPG cruising at 58 MPH on the interstate.  I have a combined average of 19.8 since new.  On a 2500 mile trip I got 23.0.  Very impressive.  Downs - black interior trim swirls and scratches like crazy.  Leather seating looks like it's been sat in for 10 years already.  It sags and has permanent indentions.  I use Meguiars Leather cleaner/conditioner and it makes them look clean and shiny, but leather still looks worn beyond actual life.  Car is strong as heck, does what I want it to, but seats and trim are questions.  ","Fuel economy great if you take it easy. Use the cruise control as much as you can.  It helps with uncontrolled acceleration. Any stretch over 5 miles I use it. If you drive aggressive or impatient, you'll struggle to get 18 on the highway. I did when I experimented with it.

While I test drove the BMW X5 (3.0) and the Audi Q7 I  always came back to the MDX (Tech/ent). While the other SUVs offered some minor technologies not found in the MDX, those features would have satisfied less than 1% of my needs but when they were configured with all the features of the Tech/Ent MDX the competitors were $8k-$10k more.  The performance of the car is really great and even when taking a bend at a high speed it seemed to handle the road better than my coupe.  The exterior design is very nice and gives the SUV and aggressive look. My wife and I love the SUV but really miss the efficiency that we once had with a sedan",The handling is better than expected. The interior is well designed and comfortable. Performance is better than expected but with a 300HP engine I should have anticipated it would have a better acceleration than some of the other SUVs I tested. The navigation system is one of the best and so is ELS,Gas mileage is poor but better than some in its class. Handsfreelink is poorly integrated with nav and should only have been one voice recognition button for nav and HFL. The engine does have more noise than some other SUVs but it is more of a respectable growl worthy of the aggressive look.

When you think about the balance of power, handling, value, reliability, it is hard to beat this SUV.  In 2006, Car and Driver did a comparison test and MDX came out on top.
