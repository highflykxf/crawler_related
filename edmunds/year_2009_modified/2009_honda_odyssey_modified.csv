5,great car but a little behind the times,William Gowen ,05/20/2016,4,2,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,If you have a lot of electronic stuff you'll have to do some improvising. There's only one 12v outlet and no usb ports.,,
5,Honda SUPER Van,mike shinkus ,04/11/2016,5,5,4,,,5,5,5,5,,,"This is my second Odyssey. My first was a 2000 EX. I kept it 9 years and had around 121000 miles on it. I would NOT purchase any other. We have traveled all over in this Odyssey and it runs flawlessly. You can store more stuff in the back than you could imagine !!! We traveled with it loaded to the gills plus the hard shell, OME, on the roof and NEVER had an issue. The SINGLE warranty item was a rear wheel bearing when the van had about 2000 miles on it. Nothing else. Replaced the timing belt at 130000 along with the water pump and all the pulleys. Changed oil and filter every 3K miles even though I know it isn`t required but I am old school. Replaced the front rotors twice so far along with the pads. I always buy the best replacement parts and they work well. No Advanced garbage. My Odyssey likes Firestone tires as they last the longest and handle the winter weather we get here in PA. Yes, I do put snow tires on it but sometimes get caught with the all seasons on. Highly recommend any one to purchase the Honda Odyssey. Simply THE BEST !!!! I will be selling this one in 2 more years, I keep them 9 years as long as they deserve it and this one does !!!!",,

Our first died at 135K with a starter problem that couldn't not be fixed, by anyone! That car also had transmission failure at 100K, replaced under warranty. ( a different dealership)Our 2009 Odyssey has had power steering pump replaced- twice, fuel pump replaced and now, the same starter problem at 135K. The starter has been replaced but it did not fix the problem. We are done with Honda, though I think the this dealership has gone above and beyond in trying to make us happy.

However, in addition to the two new engines we've spent thousands of dollars on little repairs that keep coming up. We've owned the car for a little over two years and on average it's been in the shop once every month for the last two years. I will NEVER buy a Honda again. ",,Each time we take our car into the shop for an issue covered under warranty the mechanics reach out to Honda and Honda decides to do the least expensive repair possible. They put a bandaid on when they should do surgery - spend the money to do repairs that will actually fix the car. Utterly disappointed in the level of service. I will never buy another Honda. 
2,Unreliable,lktowens ,06/18/2013,,,4,4,1,1,,1,3,1,1,Excessive oil consumption issue that Honda will not recognize (much less fix) causes this car to be highly unreliable.I will not buy another Honda.,,

Some were fixed under warranty and some noises they just do not know where they come from. CV joints needed to be replaced at 30,000, strut mounts went bad at 45,000. Noise is when I accelerate between 40 and 55 mph. I will not buy another Honda. On top of that the dealer does not seem to care and Honda customer service did nothing. I had 5 toyotas and never had any problems. Will have to go back to Toyota. STAY AWAY if you need a reliable car",,
2.25,"Brakes, doors and windows",RAC ,11/05/2010,,,2,2,1,2,,3,3,3,2,"Very unsatisfied with this vehicle. I'm owner of three other Honda and decided to buy and Odyssey. Decided to buy lower end Honda because i don't like automatic doors. van has been in the dealer twice for issues with the doors due problems with spring. at 21k miles van was having issues when pressing the brakes at 50 mph the steening wheels vibrates very hard, took van to the dealer and according to the dealer rotors are uneven and need re-surface or replacement. According to do them the problem is bad driving. I cannot believe this response. I have other Honda and has never had any issues with rotors at this early driving mileage. Warranty doesn't cover rotors after 10K miles. Van not recommended.","None, very disappointed, rubber around the door is melting and causing black marks on the glass and causes the window to get stick","Need to revise quality, Honda is going in the same trend as Toyota.

VERY scary and dangerous.  I have been driving for over 30 years and have NEVER had this problem.  Seems the pedal is not high enough and there is no adjustment.  2 times this happened at busy 55mph intersection - engine racing, abs light on, van still moving forward and my foot on the brake.  3rd time, almost hit the basketball post in my driveway.

The handling and agility is quite impressive for a minivan.  Road noise can creep through on occasion.    Not the perfect minivan, but a very good one.","Comfy leather seats, sporty handling,  the center tray console- we put everything on that thing!

3,Rides Like A Truck,DrFerry ,03/29/2010,,,4,4,3,4,,3,1,2,3,"We had a 2000 Odyssey LX and kept for nine years. My wife replaced our 2000 model with a new EX-L in July '09 - when Dealers were practically giving them away. The most annoying thing about the van is how harsh it rides. It crashes over the smallest bumps. Potholes feel as if the van has no suspension as everything seems to shake and vibrate. The vehicle is way over sprung and over damped in bump and rebound. A road can look smooth, but the ride will be jiggly, nervous and harsh. I have had ridden in Pick- Up trucks that do a better job of isolating road irregularities than a 2009 Odyssey EX-L. I wish we could take it back and get a model with a softer ride. Go for a long test drive folks.",Plenty of cup holders and air-bags. The button to close the rear hatch is a great idea. Rear luggage space is huge as the third row seats fold into the floor. Cylinder deactivation saves a tiny bit of gas when cruising. The side door dashboard activation buttons are a nice touch.,Please offer a model with a more comfortable suspension. We don't all want to take our vans to the race track. Wish I did not have to put it in park to open the side doors - which is real annoying at the school drop off line and anywhere else for that matter. Offer a 4cyl version with 30mpg city.
4.125,"Nice Van, Pricey",D F ,03/16/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,4,4,"Bought new in 09' well under invoice.  Van is comfortable, easy to drive, gets decent hwy mpg.  Comfortable seating, plenty of room.","Automatic doors, comfortable seating, Nav system easy to use, lots of room.","Stock radio not very good, brakes could be better.

3.75,Electrical and mechanical Issues,Brad Armstrong ,02/01/2010,,,5,5,2,2,,4,5,3,4,"This car (2009 Honda Odyssey) quit on my wife in the middle of rush hour traffic. Smoke coming from under the hood and making a loud puffing sound. The dealer found that the timing belt cover had come loose and was leaking oil. The dealer fixed this issue. Now the car will only run for a few days at a time and will not start. Left the car at the dealer and they provided a rental. The dealer called to say the problem was fixed, but when I arrived to pick it up it would not start. They replaced the battery an this only lasted for for four days. They can't seem to find the problem. So far the dealer is doing all they can, but the car is now back in the shop.",Love the room and all the bells and whistles. But what good are they if it will not start?,
1.875,DO NOT BUY HONDA ODYSSEY...MUST READ!!!!,Mary Snyder ,01/01/2010,,,2,3,1,1,,1,3,3,1,"DO NOT BUY HONDA ODYSSEY'S.  New 2009 Honda Odyssey with 5000 miles.  Dealer has had to upgrade the transmission software twice and replaced the torque converter one to attempt to eliminate a transmission/vehicle vibration issue.  Steering wheel shakes when moved off center and vibrates at highway speeds.  Tires rotated, balanced, etc.  Both problems still present with no improvement.  Both sliding doors rattled severely, now they just squeak.  Dealer won't touch the vehicle anymore to prevent Lemon Law from becoming effective.  Drive vehicle on smooth roads and YOU WILL notice these issues. ",It runs!,Lask the feel and quality of the previous generation.  Interior materials not to par.  Quality and reliability is embarrassing.  Honda is becoming the GM of the 80's.  Honda is not what is used to be.
4.5,Great for 5; Need more power points,Gil P. ,12/07/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Have driven 18K in a year.  From the midwest, have gone to NYC, Chicago, Disney, and many other few hour trip.  Awesome vehicle, 2nd one owned, traded in Pilot when family became 5.  The use of space is terrific.  MPG is as expected. The only downside is the features and innovation have seemed to plateaued.  Also, to make space for the Ipod jack, they took away a lighter/power point.  This leaves two for the EX-L.  And when you have 3 kids, all who want to watch or play some form of entertainment on a 8 hour trip... recipe for fighting.  Other than that, Odyssey is the best family vehicle going.","Driving position, seat comfort on long trip (I'm 6'0""), XM, and plenty of space for 5 and luggage.","More powerpoints --- at least 2 more or 4 for the entire vehicle.  HONDA - if you have to take something out as a cost feature, dump the 6 changer CD or go back to manual HVAC."
4.5,First minivan and love it,Ven ,11/06/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"This is my first mini van and I love it. Have all the nice features. Haven't experienced anything bad. A few changes both cosmetic and technical which would cost a penny to Honda can make it even more fun. Cosmetic like: on the driver/passenger side when the seat belt is released, the hook that is retracted is making scratches on the plastic and it is looking ugly after a few months. Maybe a softer plastic can be used like Toyota. And technical, VCM. And the child seat, if that can be stowable it will be great.  ","Back up camera, sliding doors, all windows going down at the same time just with a punch of a key...awesome.",Just the things I mentioned above. 
4.5,Best-in-class van,FirstOdyssey ,10/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"New dad with rapidly-growing infant. Reliability, comfort, convenience were top considerations. Like other reviewers, compared Odyssey to Sienna, Quest, VW, as well as against large SUVs. Found Odyssey to be best combination of features/utility/design for the price and for our needs. Purchased end-of-year model with 40 miles on odometer for about $1600 under invoice. Drives more like a car (albeit a Honda, and not a BMW), surprisingly roomy, cavernous cargo space when 3rd row is folded down, intuitive/ingenious fold-down 3rd row, trouble-free through first 500 miles. Solid feel throughout. Plastic dash, but that's what you get for about $25K.","Honda-reliable, comfy, easy to use fold-down seats, powered sliding doors, nice exterior look, feels solid.","Louder-than-expected freeway noise (just slightly less than my MB E-class with sports package tires), somewhat awkward heat/AC system (where's the ""on"" button?), subpar speakers."
4.75,Good intro to minivan ownership,dad2be ,10/15/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We've had this van for about 6 months now and are very satisfied with our purchase.  Just got back from a 3000 mile road-trip to Florida and averaged the EPA stated 23 mpg with a full load.  At purchase time, we got almost $6000 off of MSRP (when deals were good prior to cash for clunkers) which certainly influenced our decision and I still think it is a great value.  No mechanical problems to date.  I read through some other reviews and folks mention the road noise and the way the transmission shifts.  Nothing that bothers our family, but do take a long test drive with a mix of city and highway roads before purchasing any vehicle - don't assume you'll love it just because it's a Honda...","Homelink, power sliding side doors, mp3 jack, plenty of power for getting on highways and pulling a full load.","Don't force people to upgrade to the ""EX-L"" model to get the power hatch. Put the cylinder deactivation feature on all models, not just the upper levels. Bumper strength isn't ideal - bumped into something at very low speed (<5 MPH) with the back bumper and was surprised to find damage."
5,Soccer Dad,Alan ,10/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"A++++ , First ever Mini in my life, looked at Sienna & others stopped once I drove this one. It's not really a van , more like a car. Dealership did an excellent price as well, no others would come this low price wise for less quality. Roomy, classy and you can still look like a cool guy...lol. My boys love it , lots of storage for sports stuff and as my oldest says ""wow there are a lot of cup holders"".","Steering wheel controls for radio/cd player,  6 disc changer,  in door sunshades,  tri controls for heating/ac,  electric driver seat and mirror defrost.","Compass,  more interior colors to choose from,  dvd player standard for the price on all models."
3.875,NICE but: Don't get the VCM model,George ,10/02/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,2,3,Love the Odyssey BUT -- don't get the VCM model.  There is a low growl/drone vibration you can feel and hear when it kicks into 3 cyl mode.  Especially in cold weather.  HONDA WON'T disable it and claims that the noise is normal!  VCM doesn't activate when the engine is cold during the first 5 min of driving so there must be a way to disable it programmatically.  There also is a loss of power that is noticeable during VCM cruise on slight inclines.  This causes the mph to drop well below your cruise setting.  I prefer to eat the fuel savings (if any) than put up with this annoyance.  It is extremely noticeable at 40 and 70 mph and when fully loaded.  Must be at just the right rpm's.,"Backup camera is addicting, performance is very good when the VCM isn't engaged, seating arrangements are excellent although the steering needs another inch or two of telescoping for long leg people (I feel I have to reach when the seat is set correctly for my long legs).  Nice exterior style/colors.","NEEDS a VCM OFF SWITCH or disengage at the dealer upon customer request.  Improve the interior plastics.  The XM radio is one of the cheapest on the market with limited display since the text is HUGE. Road and wind noise is HONDA typical and needs soundproofing, why hasn't this been addressed yet?"
4.875,First Time Van Owner,bad_dog205 ,10/01/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We bought this vehicle with a 2400 mile Disney World trip in mind. It practically drove itself there and had us convinced we were in a luxury sedan. Driving feel was sporty. Mileage was 23 mpg despite using a/c even while parked often and driving 65-80 mph. At home it's closer to 16 mpg. Our son runs to get in and has never mentioned the SUV (he used to love so much). My wife hated to buy a minivan but fights over who gets to drive it next.,"Versatile stereo/DVD system, reliable simple NAVI/Backup camera, strong A/C, comfortable seats, power doors, individual tire pressure status.",Stereo has many ways to customize between front and rear but is neither intuitive nor superior sounding. Brakes feel too soft. Steering wheel should telescope 3 inches for long legs. Parking sensors should sense further than 1.5 feet (too close to risk damage).
4.5,The great debate: Sienna or Odyssey,LaFio ,09/30/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,4,5,5,5,"I must have test driven each of these cars at least 3 times.  In the end, I got an Odyssey because I got the better deal and more options.  The Honda was fun. Downside: Honda road noise is awful and, after several weeks, I feel like I'm driving a tank with no pick up.  The passenger seat feels like it teeters when you accelerate or stop.  And the stitching on the steering wheel has come unraveled. The passenger doors don't open/close fast enough.  I'm happy with the van (see pros below), but I wish I had gotten the Sienna, despite its boring appearance.",Love the Rear DVD and rear parking camera. Seats are extremely comfortable for those with a bad back. Love new blue color.  (Tired of mocha),"Too much $$ for problems. Leather feels cheap. Road noise and car rattles. Needs more pick up.  ""Miles to Empty"" is really, really needed. "
4.75,Back to a van after years away,Allavalons ,09/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I have had 3 other vans (all Chryslers) which had turned to go to all cars back in 2000. I decided to try one more time and I have been pleasantly surprised. The Ody is really comfortable, is solid as a rock, no rattles, quiet, and with the rear camera has great visibility. The disappearing 3rd row is great and the rear well when the seat is up provides an excellent space for loads of packages, suitcases etc. The mileage is at the top end of the EPA estimate and has exceeded the estimate on several recent trips, verified by actual calculation not just the trip computer. The leather seats are the most comfortable and supportive I've had in a vehicle under $50,000.","Powers rear doors and liftgate, the fold flat 3rd row seats, the touch screen Nav beats my Toyota Nav in my Avalon hands down. The RES is great, my daughter and wife loved the wireless headphones on a recent trip. 8 passenger option is great while still providing Captains seats in 2nd row. ","Timed delay on headlights shutoff when in Auto mode would be great. Rain sensing wipers should be available on a $40,000 vehicle as should Laser cruise control."
4.5,"Well, the kids love it...",ebd135 ,09/02/2009,,,5,4,4,5,,5,5,4,4,"After our third came around it was time to move up in terms of size with our vehicles.  This is our second Honda product so no real surprises in build/material quality, which as been good so far.  The van has been very functional and the power doors are great.  The space within the van is excellent, as is the driving characteristics of the vehicle. Gas mileage is been in the middle 20's so far, but I will expect less during the winter. The children love the van and taking long trips has been a much more pleasant experience for the whole family.","Rear view back up camera/monitor, DVD player controls placed in the front of the vehicle, power doors, cargo space, and general comfort level and driving characteristics.",Gas mileage indicator would a nice touch.   Outside temperature gauge would be better served in different location other than in the dash.  
5,Good choice!,teresa  ,08/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Had a 2006 odyssey lease. Love the new EXL with auto tailgate. Researched many models and bought the best! Got a very fair price and good dealer experience.  Also great for traveling, holds everything for a months vacation. Also like our color choice which is dark cherry. Very pleased with our purchase. ","Very easy to drive and park and we are both ""seniors"" I am using the back up mirror a lot. Our 2006 did not have the auto tailgate and it makes it easy to put items in back of van.  ","None yet. I did notice that you have to be careful not to open the tailgate from a distance, in a parking lot, without accessing oncoming vehicles. "
4.75,1 solid mini-van,fmichael ,08/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"There's no surprise that the Odyssey is 1 of the best selling mini-vans on the market today...Solid build quality, reliable, comfortable, and versatile...Fuel economy has averaged 22/23 mpg with 80% hwy/20% city  driving.","Handles 70 plus mph just fine (well built engine/transmission), firm road manners (handles like a much smaller car), great all-around visibility from the drivers seat, and lots of interior room. ","This is minor - however I wish my Oddy would've come with better OEM tires; the Michelin LX aren't exactly awful tires, but I would've preferred the Cooper CS4 (which IMO is equal to the Michelin Harmony)."
3.875,Basic features missing for a loaded car,Boilerace ,08/11/2009,,,4,3,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Previously owned a Toyota Sienna Van. Liked the car, but went to buy a new one and they did not want to deal.  Price for Honda EX-L with Nav and RES was amazing right out of the gate.  So we bought it. The van is good, but disappointed in Honda. They seem stuck in the past with basic styling.  The van is built well, but the exterior is boring.  The van is loaded, BUT I am so upset that with all the great features that there are basics missing. Automatic lights are not on the van.  We leave the lights on once a week. Basics of ""Miles to empty"".  It has a nav system but I can't tell me how many miles until empty.  The van is good.....don't love it, but it's good. ",It's a Honda.  You know it will last over 5 years and value will hold......unlike most American cars.  Nav system is great and the roominess is really good. ,Auto lights and miles to empty.  Almost every car around $30K has these features.  On a Honda you have to go to the touring model.  
4.75,So far so good...,Christy ,08/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Well, I never thought I'd say it, but I love my new minivan!  I've only had it a week, but I don't know how I got along without it before.   The power sliding doors and tailgate are awesome.  It is so easy to get my kids in and out of the car now.  The carseats are easy to configure and install in this vehicle.  My baby's infant seat fits perfectly behind my seat, even with seat back to accommodate my longer legs' length.  So far, my only complaint is that there is only one 12V outlet in the front of the van, so I can't charge my Garmin and cell phone at the same time.  My previous ride was a 2006 Pilot and I had three outlets within arm's length. Despite this, I'm still lovin' my new Ody!","Power sliding doors and tailgate; back-up camera (didn't even know it had one until I went to pick up the car, but I love having it!).",At least one more 12V outlet in the front of the van.

Each time it activated I lost about 2-4 mph while on 70mph (cruise control).  When it deactivates VCM  all of the cylinders kick back in and I was back up to my cruise control setting speed of 70mph.  Rather annoying especially when you have vehicles in front and behind you and they are at a steady cruise speed.  Down to 3 cylinders is when you hear and feel an annoying growling.  Then a loss of power and you lose speed.   HONDA, please put in a switch to disengage the 3 cylinder mode which I believe is the issue.  The 4 cyl mode doesn't seem to be a problem.  From NY to FL, I experienced the same. ","Exterior style, seating arrangements, space, color, rear fold down, middle removable, reliability, stature, overall performance.","HONDA, please put in a switch to disengage the 3 cylinder mode.  VCM 6/4/3 switch.  A Sport Suspension Mode would be nice as well, especially when you are loaded. Needs a better XM radio.  My Sonata has a better one.  Standard tow package would be nice."

The 09 Touring has great features and functionality and keeps on getting better compared to our 04 and 05.  Road noise is non-existent, fuel economy is 22 city and 28 highway.  The radio is well placed and logical and the nav has everything including a compass.  I paid 40% off of the $42K sticker due to dealer hunger.

5,And he swore we wouldn't by a minivan...,Luvmydaughter ,07/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my second Honda Odyssey. My first was a 2003 Odyssey EX. I have had a history of selling my cars after 2-3 years. My last Odyssey I had over 6.5 years-130,000 miles with nothing wrong with it. Only scheduled service.  My husband also swore HE would never buy a Honda OR a minivan.  When I was pg with my first child he was completely SOLD with the Odyssey- enough to get him to buy a Pilot a year later. SO when we got the new one it was a no brainer. I didn't even have to shop the market. The leather interior is beautiful. The basics are the same as the 2003 but they made it more luxurious and FUN! Wouldn't trade it for the world!","DVD player in dash - AWESOME feature. My last one I added an aftermarket DVD player that worked well, but the factory one is so much better! The leather is so soft. Rear cam is great. Sun shades are handy. Love that the rear windows roll down. All in all fun to drive!",My only complaint is you can only get the DVD system with the EXL or higher - granted I ended up with a higher model than originally expected (that I love). It was disappointing that you couldn't get it with the well equipt EX (as with my 2003). It looks like they have changed this with the 2010. : )

At first the wife was worried about her coolness factor and driving a minivan, but after driving it for a few weeks she is in love with the room and convenience.  I like it for the features and handling.  On many occasions now I've been driving at highway speeds when a light turns red and I'm worried about stopping in time an was initially surprised that I stopped with no problem and had room to spare.  In the Vue, I would have had trouble stopping.   The seats are comfortable, everything seems to be of good build quality.",I love the automatic trizone climate control... also like the built in sunscreens on the sliding door for our baby.,Wish they had more color combinations with a darker interior color to make it easier to keep it clean with the kids.

Odyssey's ability to load and control the DVD from the front with 2 small kids is a big win.  Ultimately, though, Honda was willing to negotiate more than Toyota, with an offer below the TMV - What Others are Paying quote (below invoice).  Have had the van for almost a month... no issues with noise, great mileage (avg. 21 mpg with a mix of highway/city driving), love the handling.","Front loading DVD, remote control for DVD, automatic liftgate open/close, adjustable armrests.","My husband doesn't like the speedometer since it only shows miles by 20's, with dashes for the 10's.

Both vehicles have been completely reliable, a joy to own and drive and perfect for my family. However, one big surprise. Even with the 3,4 & 6 cylinder switching engine, the fuel economy has been averaging 13- 14 mpg. I'm not an aggressive driver and now that I know I'm getting this mileage, I've been trying to improve it but with not a lot of success.

We got everything we need in a minivan, including excellent quality, without the added expense of features we don't really need.  If you can live without power seats, power sliding doors, a high end stereo, leather, etc., then the LX is a great choice.  Mechanically its really the same van as the high end model.  You just need to be ready to open your own door and perhaps read a map if you really don't know where you're going.","The seats are extremely comfortable, both front and rear.

Our new 2009 is even more refined. Much more plush interior, nicer exterior colors and lines. Features like power liftgate and backup camera are super useful.  Some complain that their new Ody rides rough. Actually, it reminds me of the driving feel of my Bimmer. You can definitely ""feel"" the road; but it's a good refined feeling, not a ""rough"" feeling.

That even extended to the pre-drilled bolt-holes that allowed me to install a trailer hitch in about a 1/2 hour using only a socket wrench. The Honda's principal drawbacks are that it is noisier than other minivans and the entertainment system is too complicated.  Plus, it's wider than other minivans, which makes garage parking harder.",VCM is invisible in operation and significantly boosts mileage.  Interior storage and cabin organization are superb.

Honda was 28% off sticker and way below invoice listed on websites.  Way different than last time we bought from Honda. This van was thousands less expensive than what Nissan or Toyota would do.  Ford was not that great either.  Now I know why Honda has the best year over year sales figures.  They know what market they are dealing in...

The one option we both wanted, living up here in the frozen north, are heated seats. At first we only wanted the EX model, but had to purchase the EX-L to get the heated seat option, along with the other options that came with the EX-L. This cost us over $3000.00 extra, all because we wanted heated seats.

I also felt it more when the gear downshift as I am gliding along with the foot off the gas pedal and running with the ECO light on.

I know it is an base model but for safety reasons, with children in mind, I wish Honda would just make all their models with electronic doors.  I would have loved to purchase the EX but could not afford the price.  Also would prefer the review mirrors to be a bit larger as their is a blind spot area that is hard to catch.  Second, design the radio closer to the driver so you're not having to reach so far over to work the radio - some people are short.

4.625,Follow up on my 08 Touring,Hammock1 ,10/18/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,4,5,"After driving a nice van in most regards except a rattle trap, finally got it to an Illinois dealer who cured the rattle problems by applying a Honda grease (Part# 08798-9013) to all the door gaskets.  Wow, now totally rattle free.  Just over 21,000 and love it more all the time.  In Daytona Beach area where I live, they added ethanol now and gas mileage dropped to 21 around town and 24 on the road but ALL vehicles suffer with Ethanol.","Easy to drive.  Roomy, GPS is great once you figure it out.  Comfortable and drive 1,200 miles non stop at times.  Everything works as advertised.","No complaints now at all.  Follow HONDA service, NOT the dealer as some will try and get into your wallet big time.  Biggest improvement Honda can make is in the sales dept."
5,Best van ever!,podra ,09/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just bought the 2009 Odyssey it is the best van there is in the market. This Honda is well built, smooth and quiet, very powerful and it has great reliability and great value. Brought it home 2 weeks ago and no problems. Our last car was a sienna and it had transmission problems so i sold it. Always buy a Honda it won't disappoint.","powerful and smooth v6, solid feeling materials, not a Toyota Sienna!",nothing at all!
2,Do NOT buy the PAX,BrokeHondaOwner ,09/18/2008,,,2,2,2,2,,1,3,1,3,"Do not buy the PAX model.  The tires only last 25,000 miles, if that, and they cost $1,500 for a set of four. This means, that by the time you hit 50,000 miles (when  most tires wear out), you will have spent $4,500 on tires.  If you get a flat, Honda recommends you buy 2 new tires because the tires are not repairable.  Nice going Honda...",,Get rid of PAX.  Keep them off the Accord!
2.625,Overrated Odyssey,Mike Jones ,09/11/2008,,,3,4,2,2,,3,3,2,2,"Look the its a good van, but way too much for the price. I should gone with my gut instincts and bought the Toyota Sienna. I listened too much to Model Review experts and not my heart. The Sienna rode like a dream, much better in my opinion than the reviews. The Honda makes a louder noise when accelerating on the highway than the Sienna. Toyota also offered a lot more standard features than Honda did. I listened to my wife and I should have changed her mind. Honda is good, but the Sienna' s Style, performance and overall quiet powerfully safe ""star rating"" is superb. I am probably going to trade in my Honda for the Sienna.",Exterior appearance. cosmetics.,"Follow the Toyota's overall quality. The braking was a little more demanding than when I stopped with the Sienna model. Everyone I can see is buying the Honda for its looks as the final decision. However, check out the Sienna up close and inside. I regret not getting initially."
1.125,Not good,Paul Leiberstien ,09/05/2008,,,2,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,"I've had mine for about two months and I am very disappointed.  Came out of a Caravan lease that had no issues for the entire time I had it.  The Odyssey has squeaking brakes, doors rattle, and the DVD player skips.  Try telling our 4 year old that the movie has to start all over again all the way to Florida.  Not pretty.  I wouldn't recommend the Honda",I thought that I would have no problems but I have had to have it in for service many times.  So I guess that I have no favorite features,After talking to other owners at the Honda dealership I think Honda are way overrated.  Will not buy another.
