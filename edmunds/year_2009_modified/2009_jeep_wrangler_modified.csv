4,Great Fun but Time to Move On,Rascula ,11/14/2015,4,4,4,,,3,5,3,3,,,"I bought my 09 Wrangler Unlimited Sahara in June of 2009 and will be honest for the most part it was a great vehicle. It did what I needed it to do getting me wherever I needed to be, protecting my children and I when we were hit by a drunk driver from behind at nearly 40 miles per hour, and the touch screen radio with GPS and HDD were wonderful to have for getting to places and not having a vehicle cluttered with CD's. I rarely took my front top panels off but when I did everyone loved it (cant say how heavy or difficult the back portion was as I never removed it).     My torque converter did go bad at 42K miles (thankfully I bought the lifetime warranty on the vehicle which in and of itself paid for the tranny issue), I had to replace the brakes at 65K miles with the rear passenger side shoe sticking and needing a-lot of work, the door hinge bushings were starting to go bad, and finally the O2 sensors (which there are 4 of) went bad twice.       I did truly love the vehicle. Visibility was great, the ride was smooth for a 4x4 and it was easy to handle. My main reason for getting rid of it is that the gas mileage is lower than I would have liked and I travel a-lot. I never got more than 21 mpg on the highway (and roughly 50k of the 75k miles I put on it were highway).      If you want a fun 4X4 and can get past the lack of mpg and a little less than desirable power the 2009 was a good vehicle (at least for me).",,
4.375,The Last Car.,The Last Car ,11/18/2010,,,3,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I call this ""the last car"" because I will never drive anything else. That said, it is not a ""car"" as much as a street legal toy. A giant go-cart.  The feeling of driving a jeep is incomparable, but certainly not for everyone. In fact, if you even have to debate whether you should; then you probably shouldn't.  If you are comfortable, however, with the idea of changing a heavy stubborn top (hard or soft), having little freeway acceleration, and generally driving a giant go-cart; then this is the car for you!  You have to be prepared to think of your Jeep as a street-legal toy to really appreciate it.  (Also, get the manual transmission or just get yourself a minivan)",Off-road ability (duh). Convertible top. Reliability. Sense of freedom and adventure every time you drive. It really is an experience.,"None that I can think of. There again, if you know what you are getting into, then you really can't complain about the downsides of jeep ownership."
2.75,Mixed Feelings on our Bailout Buggy,JDH ,10/28/2010,,,5,5,1,2,,2,2,2,3,"Got this bailout buggy in 4/09 and have 17,500 miles. The transmission went out at 14,000 miles and it's been a downward spiral ever since to the point that we are considering trading this in for something else. Before that, though, we loved the car. While performance is mediocre, nothing beats a topless Jeep in the summer. Keep the tops off, though, as long as possible since they were poorly designed and engineered. The hard top leaks consistently. Fuel economy is lackluster around town at 14 mpg, but shines on the freeway at 20 mpg at 75 mph. No complaints on the interior of the vehicle, so far. The Sahara model specifically has a smooth ride as well. Also, the 4x4 system is beyond great.",MyGig & Navigation System are flawless. The looks and intimidation of this vehicle in black alone remind me why I got this over an Escape. Handled excellently in the Arizona mountains & is great in the snow. The YesEssentials cloth seats are durable and great. I also like the center dash stack.,Whole new powertrain. Put a V8 in for Pete's sake. Automatic transmission needs to go. Four speeds is ancient now a days. Both should help out fuel economy since the car won't need to be floored to get to speed at a reasonable rate. Fix quality issues at the plant and don't leave it to the dealer.
4.875,Jeep Wrangler ,Dacoda ,10/06/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Had a 1995 Jeep Wrangler Sahara for 13 years.  Bought the New 4 door and just love it.

1.875,Not So Sure About JEEP!,Dawn ,09/24/2010,,,2,4,1,1,,1,2,2,2,"I bought this vehicle new in Oct 2009. I have only put 9500 miles on it in a year. I just had to take it to the shop to have A LOT of work done to it. First there was a recall. I took it in for that and they found a right front axle leak. While I was waiting for the part to come in I had the oil changed and the guys at the oil place found a front differential leak, a rear differential leak, intake leak and also had to replace the steering shaft. The Chrysler place had to rebuild my rear end differential. It also kicks when it goes into first gear. I just got it back and it still does it! I think it will be going back again! I love my jeep but the quality of this vehicle is not good!",I like the color!,It needs to have more power and the quality is horrible!  Needs lots of improvement!

But the Jeep wrangler, regardless of the trim, is the best off road vehicle that I have ever drive. My first experience was in the jungles of Panama. I saw a Jeep wrangler assigned to the us embassy negotiating hard terrain. After that I promised I would get one.","Big fun factor, great off road capability, unique looks, topless and doorless driving. Unstoppable in the snow.

Please don't consider buying a jeep unless you understand your purchase. You aren't buying a luxury car, you are buying one of the finest off roading, highly versatile vehicles on the road today.  People that complain about water leaks probably don't understand how to correctly install their top.  All and all this is an awesome vehicle to own.","Off roading capabilities, jeep mods (lift kits, wenches) topless/doorless. Highly customizable.",Bring back V8 engines.

3,Fun junk,09jeep ,08/10/2010,,,3,4,1,1,,4,3,3,5,"This thing is a fun.  There is nothing like being able to drive with no roof and no doors, no other new vehicle can do that.  Not to mention the offroad capability, which is also unmatched.  Having said that, this is the worst vehicle I've ever owned.  7000 miles and the clutch has gone bad 3 times.  (throwout bearing noise - common problem) Also leaking hardtop, lots of other small problems.  Cheap materials and build quality everywhere you look.  Check out some JK wrangler forums, mine isn't the only one with issues.

Unique looks, great capability off road, topless and doorless driving.  Huge aftermarket.  Maybe mine is just a lemon.",Horrible quality and poor reliability in my experience.

3.375,My first Jeep,09JPX ,05/14/2010,,,2,3,4,4,,4,3,2,5,"I have always wanted to buy myself a Jeep.  I finally got a job where I could afford to get what I wanted.  Although it is a much different driving experience than my Honda Accord, it is so much more fun to drive.  I have taken it off roading just once so far.  Waiting for summer to take the top off and keep it off.  And I also would like to do some upgrades to it.  It is taking me a while to get used to all the gas that it guzzles, but it is a JEEP.

4.875,"18 months later, not one complaint",greysmoke ,04/25/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is my 3rd Jeep Wrangler. The first was a '95; great fun. Then an '00; even better. The '09 4-door is a Jeep for grownups. The longer wheelbase makes for a much more comfortable ride. They've made the new ones much wider, too. I'm not completely sold on the 3.8 V6, but so far, so good. Most important points: (1) It's a Jeep. (2) Nothing has gone wrong. I've not had any work done on this Jeep except for fluid changes. For experienced Jeep owners, this model is much more civilized than what you're used to. For those new to a Jeep, be warned: it's still a real Jeep, and that means it's not going to suit everybody. ","""Freedom"" top is kind of practical. Good compromise between the old 1 piece hard top and the soft top, and mine at least doesn't leak. Still getting used to the power windows, but they're OK. Navigation system is awesome. The Remote Starter is weird to have on a Jeep, but now I'm spoiled.","I'm not sold on the plastic covered bumpers. I prefer the older models. When I open the driver's door on a rainy day, the gutter on the hard top channels a stream of water targeted precisely on my knees as I get inside.

Underpowered, driven 4cly cars that have more power. Had a cracked radiator. Many electric problems, odometer not working, windows not working, doors locking on their own, and more. The seats will kill your back, very uncomfortable. Headlights are VERY poor, worthless if you do a lot of night driving. Bought brand new and this all happened in the first 4 months of having it. The only good thing to say about it is that it preforms well off road.","Getting rid of it, has been a nightmare owning. The lemon law really saved me.

All I have to say right now is that having one its a lot of fun for me and for my family as well. It is a totally different sort of car, not comfortable at all, but it is a jeep. Not good on gas efficiency, but again it is a jeep and you have to pay for the fun part. First thing first, I recommend everyone is to upgrade the rims and tires; the factory ones are ridiculous for a jeep as well the plastic bumpers.   ",,

The 6 speed manual trans was very smooth.  The soft top buffered quite a bit doing 70 to 75 mph when the cross winds were strong and with my window open (but, would like to add that I did not purchase this vehicle for the highway).  Even with some strong desert cross winds the Jeep was very stable and sure footed.  The AC worked extremely well in the 100 plus degree weather, on the highway and in the city.   I did add the 17 inch aluminum wheels to the deal, which gave the Jeep a little more ground clearance and gave it a better look.","Simplicity of the total package, very cohesive in design in regards to what a Jeep is all about.  The stock stereo works just fine for me with the speaker well placed (more then enough volume). ","Better fuel milage may help but, it is a 6 cyl so one can expect it to use more fuel (?).

If you want a sturdy, truck- like vehicle, you'll love it. If you want an SUV that rides like a car, get a Cherokee. A Wrangler is what it is, the soft-top is noisy, no surprise.

The soft top can now open partially, and the 3-piece hard top option makes for easier removal.  Sound system is improved with larger speakers and dash-mounted tweeters, with Sirius satellite as an option.  Tow hooks and fog lamps are now standard equipment.
