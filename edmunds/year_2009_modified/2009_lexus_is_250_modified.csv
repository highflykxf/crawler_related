5,great car,John ,10/04/2016,,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,I love this car!  It rides and handles beautifully.  Too bad that over the years Lexus Dealerships have only one goal which is to make as much money as possible.  Customer support has deteriorated over the years.  This is my fourth Lexus and this car is by far the best.  I just wish it was a Honda or Acura so I would not have to deal with Toyota.,,
4.75,Very pleased with this car,johnc ,10/16/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I've had the IS250 for 2 months now and it's everything I'd hoped.  Great looks, terrific fit and finish on the interior--which sold me over the BMW 3 and even the Audi A4.  As others have noted, the ride's not as sporty as some others but I'm not on twisting turning road all that much anyway, whereas the comfort and style are always noted and appreciated.  This is my 3rd Lexus (RX & GS) and have loved them all. ","Comfort, fit, finish.  Nav and blue tooth are excellent. Gas mileage also a pleasant surprise at 27+ overall.",Rear seat is tight.  Rear visibility a little sub par
4.25,Expensive Corolla,bmh69 ,10/16/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,3,"My first year leasing the IS AWD has been ""fine.""  It is a sporty looking pre-luxury all wheel drive vehicle, top notch reliability and a spectacular dealership experience.  Beyond that it's an expensive AWD Corolla with added bells/whistles. It does do a great job in the harsh Midwest winters, but is not nearly as fun to drive as the Audi/VW cars I have owned in past.  Its handling is okay but not sporty; the ride is generally compliant but at times punishing.  It never ""goes"" when you need it to and then whines like a four cylinder.  I am generally not as excited to drive this Lexus as I was my previous autos, and sadly look forward to returning to a German AWD car when my lease is up.","The AWD/ESC works as well as a Quattro. Okay handling. Gas mileage(for an AWD) in town 24. Interior appointments. Comfortable, heated seats. Feels safe to drive. Emergency handling. Sexy looking. Back up camera. Front cup holders. Crash ratings. Trunk/storage generous for car's size.  Quiet cabin.","Rear leg room; expect complaints from your rear passengers. Fold down rear seats to the trunk. Rain gutters on doors; you get soaked when entering/exiting.  Stiff ride over rough roads. More horse power; the V6 feels like a 4.  Google Maps should handle the GPS system.  Ugly ""sport"" wood grain."
5,great Little Car,john591 ,02/10/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Ownership experience has been positive. The car draws favorable reviews for its styling. The fit and finish are excellent. It is quiet and very solid feeling on the road. Only complaint is getting used to a limitation on driver visibility to the rear.,"Favorite features are the solid ride, quiet interior, handling and the styling. The keyless entry system is also a plus as is the sensible layout of the interior.",Better visibility to the rear. 
2,Big Disappointment,City Doc ,12/26/2009,,,2,1,1,2,,3,2,4,1,"I traded in a Audi A4 for the IS250 and have been quite disappointed.  The transmission is rough when shifting, it has no get up and go, and the blind spots are huge.  I find myself having to look around a lot more in this car and am way more cautious after several near collisions because of the blind spots. The Audi was fun to drive.  The IS250 is a chore.  I'm getting rid of it after only 1 year.",Touch Screen Navigation.,Redesign both the body and the transmission.
4.625,Fun commute,chastek ,11/21/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This car is my third Lexus.  It has typical Lexus build quality, good exterior looks, and great brakes and handling.  The car is a much more engaging drive than my ES, but not as demanding as a BMW 3.   I'm averaging 27 MPG in mixed driving and thoroughly enjoy my commute now.  It's quiet and comfortable, though the rear seats are just for show... no one over 12 will want to sit back there.  ","Spritely handling, Build quality, Lexus customer service, and dealer experience",Driver footwell is too cramped by the transmission tunnel.  The rear seat needs a few more inches.  ECT button should be relocated to a visible position.  
4.875,Great mid-size sport sedan,jlandry ,11/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I chose the IS250 over BMW 3 series and Audi due to superior interior fit and trim.  Lexus interior finish is by far higher end than BMW finish at a more affordable price point.  Obviously the 250 could use some more power, but you can get that in 350 and the 250 gets great mpg.  Combined hwy and cty mileage averages about 26mpg. I get 31mpg on hwy.  The audio and nav system is superb. One drawback is not being able to program the nav system while the vehicle is moving.  Bluetooth is clear.  Dashboard instrumentation layout is very sporty and provides quick reference for temp, tire pressure, mpg and distance to empty.  Paddle shifters are nice touch and add some sportiness to daily drive.",Air conditioned seats... live in AZ. Paddle shifters.  High quality interior.  Very quiet ride from tires and cabin is very quiet.  Sound system is terrific.  Exterior styling is superb.  Great gas mileage.,More legroom for the rear seats.
4.625,Good bang for the buck!,Wooping ,10/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"I've put 9,000 miles on this IS250 Automatic.  This is a pretty nice ride.  Hard to believe it gets better mileage than a manual.  Go figure.",It accelerates smoothly and has a nice quiet ride.  The steering is tight (excellent turning radius).  Huge breaks... stops on a dime!,"Like everyone else... needs more leg room... Americans are BIG.  Example, I am just 6ft tall... no one can sit in the seat behind me.  The sun visor does not protect my eyes when swung into the side window position... sloppy."
4,Overall very good but....,WD ,09/28/2009,,,4,5,3,4,,4,4,4,4,"All in all a very good deal, I agree with all the positive features mentioned elsewhere. I read somewhere about an annoying noise from the dashboard that starts few months after having the car, and I actually noticed that, it's from the driver's corner of the dashboard, a high-pitch annoying noise that occurs most on unsteady roads. I play music loud while driving and that can masks it, but a real disappointment. ","The ""snow"" drive button option. The extra power button engine option. The exterior look. Sound system   ","The dashboard noise. The white leather seats are very hard to keep clean (dunno about other cars, but even cloths will leave color prints on these ones) "
4.25,Great Car,Paul M ,09/03/2009,,,4,5,5,4,,4,5,3,4,"Just bought my 09 Lexus IS250 awd and I love it. The exterior styling is very eye catching and the interior is top quality. The seats are very comfortable, the ride is very smooth and you can barely hear any road noise inside. The radio and AC area without navigation is boring but its functional. Could use a little more power but its decent and the car handles very well. Its a very small car so a small backseat is expected. The back-seats aren't usable unless the front seats are pushed very far up, but all around its a great car!","Comfortable seats, smooth ride, paddle shifters, fit and finish.","More engine power, larger backseats, more stylish center console and maybe a screen instead."
4.875,Wonderful car,James ,07/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"We have had this car for a month now and simply love it. The external styling is best in class and the interior is top notch. Every detail is well thought out and the fit and finish is outstanding. I can understand why other reviewers focus on the power, but I consider this car a luxury car that is sporty, rather than a pure sports car. We test drove the A4 2.0T Quattro (used to own an Audi allroad) and really liked it also, but the interior seemed outdated and the engine, although better kick, did not seem as refined as the IS250. And, in the end we didn't want to be in the Audi shop all the time like we were with the allroad. Bottom line, Lexus really did a fantastic job on this car. ",Interior fit and finish. Exterior styling. Instrument panel. Air conditioned seats. Puddle lamps. Excellent handling and smooth engine/transmission. Extremely quite and luxurious. Great handling. Very comfortable seats - even for long distances. Good gas mileage.,Just a tad more pep would certainly be nice. Don't mess with anything else!
3.625,"TERRIBLE Driving Position, Hurts R Leg",docboy ,06/30/2009,,,1,5,5,5,,4,1,4,4,"Traded TSX for IS250 AWD. Decided on IS over the G37, 335, TL, and WRX. Thought the IS had the most comfy front seats of the bunch. I was sorely wrong. Happy at first, nice ride and solid handling, until my right leg started to hurt. Didn't notice it much at first, but after 4 weeks in this car, there's a glaring stupid BUMP protruding out the driver's side. Simply cannot rest my right foot and leg in proper straight ergonomic manner. Right leg simply cannot straighten out, liken a repetitive stress disorder. BUMP part of AWD trans; whole body hurts to drive. Regret buying this car, will never buy AWD Lexus sedan again. May be forced to trade-in after only 1000 miles! Ridiculous.","Nice exterior design, solid handling, little body roll, 204 HP has decent torque range, good highway gas mileage, good lumbar support. Reviews of AWD suggest good traction in snow but since I may be forced to trading the car in after only 1k miles and is still summer, I'll never know.","Poor interior design, absolutely cramped interior gets worse every time you sit inside. AWD transmission prevents any reasonable front driving position. Right leg has absolutely no comfortable area to rest or place. Car seems designed for people <5' w/short skinny legs. Interior redesign needed!"
4.5,It ALMOST could,sig alph g ,02/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,5,3,"Coming out of a pickup I realized that it was going to be a small car. However, it rides like a true sport luxury car and with all the creature comforts, i.e., HID, temp seats, navi, etc. I feel it was a good purchase. The ride is a lot better (to me) than a comparable c300, and 328i. Also, the quality of the Lexus is second to none. The interior fit and feel makes a Benz or Beemer really feel entry level. Lastly the power.. I didn't want it for the ""power"" but a little more ""oomph"" would have been great, as well, the back seat has 0 leg room. maybe a I250/350L would be good?","all of the creature comforts as well, as classy, upscale styling.","add L ( long ) version, and some more power.  "
5,Great car,1HappyGuy ,02/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was considering a BMW 328i which has a much sportier feel but when I compared the features of the IS 250 to BMW, Lexus proved to be a much better value.  True, the IS isn't a BMW but the style, workmanship, navigation system and options are much better than what was available with BMW and I don't have to contend with the run flat tires that come standard with the 328i.  Lexus tweaked the steering to the 2009 IS and this results in a much better drive.  Keyless entry system and quiet interior are wonderful. People don't realize that I am driving when I call them using the Bluetooth feature. Get the iPod connection.  It works wonderfully with the 13 speaker sound system which is very good. ","Ventilated from seats; style, sound system and layout of the dashboard. The sound and navigation systems beat the BMW hands down. The quality of the leather is superb. Gas mileage is very good and is the primary reason why I chose a 250 instead of a 350.    ","The 250 has nice pickup but it would have been great if the car had 230 horse power in lieu of 204.  Stiffer suspension would also have been nice. Notwithstanding the suggested improvements, I have no regrets choosing an IS 250 instead of a 328i. "
4.875,Luxury Sporty car,Eric ,02/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Good handling, sexy exterior, luxury interior, good pick up.","I love the exterior design, and the interior is the great quality, smart keyless, good value. ",Increase the horsepower.
4.375,Lexus IS 250 AWD - 2006 technology,alterbear ,01/27/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,3,4,5,"I leased a new Lexus IS 250 AWD after being told that the new model been updated for 2009.  Yes, there are some minor styling and other changes, but it's still a 2006 technology platform.  For example, the navigation system has no text to speech, no traffic info, outdated maps, poor routing - you could do better with a portable unit for $150.00.  ","Fun vehicle to drive, great looking car, all wheel drive is great in snow, reasonable gas mileage.",Needs to move up to the competition - does not compare well feature for feature.  Too long between initial launch of the vehicle and updates.
4.125,Good but not Great,Mark ,01/17/2009,,,5,4,4,5,,3,3,5,4,"I've owned this car since it first came out.  Picked it up at the end of December 2005.  The interior looks and feels great (but it's still not Audi in terms of physical feel).  The seats look great and feel soft to the touch.  However, after more than 45 minutes, they are so soft that your rear begins to ache as you can somewhat feel the metal platform underneath.  They definitely need to take some cues from Germany.  Nav system is very easy to learn and use, but like many others, you can't use it while moving.  Interior lighting with LED accents is still state of the art.","Great nav system with hi-res screen, great low-light backup camera, beautiful dash and gauges, nice keyless solution including touch sensitive handles.  Great looking from front and sides (not rear).  Controls and usability are kept clean due to touch screen.","Engine is way too small for the price. This car is a dog.  Even if you wanted to spend the money, you can't get to the 300hp engine without giving up AWD which is a problem in the NE.  Rear seats and trunk are extremely tight.  HID headlamps not standard"
5,"Its beautiful, really.",Bhutto ,12/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Before buying this I test drove a lot of vehicles, MB C class, BMW 335 and Infiniti, but IS has a different nice good taste to it, more stiff (in a good way) than MB, more stylish interior with same driving experience than BMW, more style than Infiniti (I think). Liked the exterior styling and standard features like fog light, LED lights, turn indicators on the side mirrors, side mirrors are heated too. I am really very very happy with my choice and recommend you all to test drive this to realize what a nice car it is. Its Lexus.","Optitron meters, which turn orange when you are more than your set speed limit to alarm you of the high speed, nice base 13 speaker sound system, nice punch to it. Good acceleration but come on its 2.5 L, if you are really that acceleration fan then buy IS 350 but that doesn't have the RWD. Cozy int.","None whatsoever, its beautiful and complete the way it is. Thanks Lexus for making such a beauty."
