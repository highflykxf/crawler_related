4.375,Off-Road Machine,jonno11 ,06/28/2011,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,5,5,"I bought the truck brand new in 2009, in a little over two years of driving I have put 43,000 kilometres on it. Just finished a road trip of 1800 kilometres through the Rocky Mountains, and it performed flawlessly. Only anomaly was the tire pressure sensor going off during extreme altitude changes, though that is a sensor issue that most vehicles have. I have used the vehicles for construction work as well as daily commuting and weekend warrior duty off-road. It has hauled ATV's, trailers, and a 6000lb camper and done s without complaint and with decent mileage. I generally average above EPA mileage, especially now that the truck is broken in. I recommend it as an inexpensive workhorse.","I love the LSD rear end and the 4.10 gears, and the 5 speed Auto makes good use of the trucks power and torque bands. The fender flares are aggressive, as are the Y-spoke wheels. The sliding rear window allows me to carry long objects without dropping the tailgate. I love the look of the grill and the clear front lights. ","I wish the truck came with 4 wheel disc brakes, a lockable tailgate, and more aggressive factory tires. I would also have loved if an electronic locking rear diff was offered, like the Frontier."

4.125,"Good simple truck,redux",Kevin ,07/04/2010,,,4,4,5,5,,3,3,5,4,Still love the little thing after one short year. I had to beef up the rear springs to handle the landscaping equipment I haul around. The am/FM radio seems to have a mind of its own. Moves off the line like an ice flow. Do not buy a ranger unless you want one.,MPG! I load this thing up!,The manual transmission's rev's drop off very slowly. By design? The cabin could be a touch larger...

4.375,Just what I expected,don ,06/18/2010,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"My Ranger is a 4 cyl 5m regular cab xlt. The ride is a bit stiff and the rear end will jump on a wash board road, but the handling is tight and it is fun to drive, I enjoy going places in it. I really commend the 4 banger with 5 m, this engine is so superior to older 4 cyl vehicles I have had, need to get up and go you spin it up but you can also put it in 4th gear at 25 mph in the snow without lugging it. The 5m works very nice. I'm getting about one mpg better then the EPA estimate. It is a two person vehicle, you can just forget about that seat belt in middle, kids small enough to fit there need a car seat to be legal. No problems yet at 7500 miles.    ","Compact size, sufficient power-although you may need a little more room for passing on a two lane-good working AC. It sure was nice of Ford to make a towing package standard in 2009. Best price around with a great rebate. ","Radio is nothing special, as previously mentioned ride can be stiff. Frankly I had no surprises when I bought it I knew the ride would be stiff and the cab small-but very happy with motor, transmission and fuel economy. Handy little truck!  "

4.875,Ranger's the Truck for me,Mike ,06/02/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my 2nd used Ranger. First was a 1997 I bought in 1999. I had few problems, just the usual parts that wear out over time. And most parts lasted longer than mechanics expected. It NEVER left me stranded on the road.I got my 2009 used at a great price with 1300 miles on it. I like the exterior appearance. While the interior dash is the same & dials are hard to read & get at while driving, the seat is more comfortable & the cab seems bigger. 4 cyc. acceleration & mileage are about the same. My 97 never burned a bit of oil & I expect with reg maintenance my 09 will be as dependable.",Sound system. Ease of handling- maneuverability.

2.375,Too basic,jj ,04/18/2010,,,1,3,2,3,,3,2,3,2,"For a car that's built recently, I can't say how my Ranger was an improvement over cars of decades past.  Yes it was cheap, only reason I got it was because it had the max rebate.  Then again cheap price = poor design, cheap quality, cheap workmanship, etc.  And worst it came off the lot with several problems which one of which became debatable if it was ""under warranty"" with the 2 yr/24000 miles contract.",Hmm. Still thinking. It's a new car.,Better design to keep up with modern living.  Better mileage (LOL) Truck feels like a car that was made in the 80s.  Dealerships should be more trustworthy (good luck with that too)

3.125,Disappointed,Disappointed ,03/11/2010,,,4,4,1,1,,3,4,4,4,"Looks good and drives good. After 6,000 miles developed any annoying rattle in the passenger side of the dash and the dealer could not find the source. Worst part was that after 5-6 months the vehicle started rusting. A couple of spots on the body, through the paint and also some painted spots under the bed and finally inside the wheels. I do live at the beach, but my 1996 Jeep Cherokee, which was 8 years old when I moved there, took 3 to 4 years to start rusting and my girlfriend lived in the Keys for 20 years and never had issues with her 3 Hondas. This is ridiculous, especially since Ford claims that their quality is even with Honda and Toyota. Warranty doesn't cover this, of course. ","The vehicle's looks and the fact that it sits up higher than a car, as all trucks do.","Put primer on all of the paintable surfaces, so it will not rust. This is not an unreasonable request! Other car makers do it. Also sometimes the truck had trouble shifting into high gear at 40 to 45 mph. Sometimes it would shift okay and other times not...fix this too."

4.25,Tough and  Fun Truck to Drive,Alfaromeo164 ,01/16/2010,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,2,5,"I bought my truck brand new and I now have 30000 in just 8 months. I havent had any real bad experiences. The only thing that stopped working is the dome light, which only turns on every so often, At 10,000KM I noticed that my clutch pedal started making a funny squeaking noise, Sounds like it needs lubrication. At 18,000km The passenger side seat stopped reclining. Im not worried because its all covered under warranty. Other than this the truck runs flawless, and is great to drive around. It handles great in Snow and sticks to the road.  Its a good buy for the money. I would highly reccomend putting a tonneau cover for a little better fuel mileage.","MP3/satellite Stereo, 5 spd transmission, rear slider window, Powerful and smooth engine, great pulling power for its class.","Style is kind of dated, Bigger wheels, gas mileage could be better, "

4.875,best for the money,don ,12/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"The thing to remember when buying a Ranger is know what you are buying. If you need room for more than two people the extended cab won't get it. Another hit it takes is for styling. I like the looks of the Ranger, especially the more pronounced grille and hood on the 2009.  I have 2900 miles on my regular cab XLT, 4 cylinder, and five speed manual. First tank averaged 25.2 and now get a 31.5 highway. Haven't checked town driving, but I imagine it's about 26. Know going in you don't have extra power with the four, but it's sufficient and has that great mileage.  This is my second Ranger and I love them. I find them comfortable, reliable, tough, good looking, and inexpensive. ","I like everything about this truck. It's enjoyable to drive, tight body with little wind noise, everything is handy & easy to use, the power equipment group is a real plus. You won't find a better truck for the price.

Bottom line, for $6k less I got a truck that was just as capable.  Perfect for hauling dirtbikes and associated gear to the track.  My only complaint is the fuel economy.  If you are going to buy one of these, make sure you buy the 4 dr supercab.  ","Smaller truck, easy to maneuver.  Plenty of power, great styling.","By this time, Ford should have been able to greatly improve fuel economy.  All Rangers should be made with the 4 door supercab."

4.375,Great truck for the money,fx4man ,09/13/2009,,,5,4,4,4,,4,5,4,5,"Good truck, with good gas mileage. Small enough to do a daily commute in city traffic, and easy to park in small spaces. Would recommend the FX4, with the payload package. There are a few squeaks and rattles in the cabin over hard bumps, but that can be easily fixed. Runs great in 4x4 mode, especially with 4.10 rear. The only real downside is the Goodyear RT/S tires. They ride good on road, but do not grip well on wet roads, and not too great in the snow. BF Goodrich A/T tires would make the truck feel more capable in rain/snow. The leather seats are very comfortable and supportive over long rides. I highly recommend this truck. It's not as fancy, but it is just as capable for the price.","Like the increased rear spring rate, helps when carrying light to medium weight loads. Leather interior is very nice. The steering is sharp and responsive. Bed extender is extremely handy. ","Occasional squeak or rattle over bumps. Fit and finish could be just a little bit better to be perfect, but this isn't an expensive Mercedes. Also could use better tires. Goodyear Wrangler RT/S tires aren't bad, but BF Goodrich tires would make this a very good truck."

Shakes and runs so rough that it causes the body and seat to shake. This goes on while driving at all speeds.  Dealership says this is in 'normal' range.  Gas mileage is about 19 1/2.   Far from the 21-26. Radio poor quality also.   Cannot pick up  stations that can on 2000 Rangers radio. Very unhappy and sorry to have purchased.

After reading all the average to poor reviews on the ranger, I only intended this vehicle as a low cost commuter and multi-purpose vehicle.  It is actually quite good.  Excellent price at less than $15K, acceptable acceleration, terrific fuel economy for a truck at 24 mpg average for 60/40 highway/city, and good build quality which Ford is now known for.

The drivers seat has lost most of its cush, but not bad considering the hours sitting in it. Im just amazed how good its been, and still is.

4.75,Buy American,Buy american ,07/02/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5, Cannot understand why reports run this truck down. It is a well made and inexpensive truck to run. You don't buy these trucks for heavy loads. Looked into a Toyato Tacoma and felt it was a rip off. Standard cap in stick shift only which forces the comsumer to buy bigger and about $4000 in price.

I can easily park in really tight spaces and it's easier to get into the garage than my Aztec was.  Front seat is very comfortable with easy access even for my handicapped sister. Not a good choice if you routinely have more than one passenger even with the jump seat.

Power is not ""excellent"" but instead basically as good as expected. However, power under load is excellent - with 1/2 ton of lumber and other materials driving manners (handling, clutch performance, braking) did not significantly decrease and power was great.
