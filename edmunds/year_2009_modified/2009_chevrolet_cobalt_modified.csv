3,My baby was a lemon,M. Crandle ,01/08/2016,3,,3,,,2,3,3,3,,,"My dad bought be a pretty blue one brand new in 2006, loved it, but I recked it in 6 months at 17,000 mi.   In 2009 I decided to purchase another at Redman Toll in Langhorne PA. I bought a pretty slate metallic 2lt coupe w/ sunroof, foglights, premium sound system, remote starter, everything but leather.  Within the first couple weeks I had an issue with the O2 sensor.  They fixed it, no problem.  After that it was one thing after another, little creaks and noises that drove me crazy, sunroof rattling, engine breaking, shimmy at high speeds.  I ended up filing a lemon law suit against GM.  They paid the car off and my dad convinced me to keep it.  Ive had the car for almost 7 years and I don't think a year has gone by without me putting it in the shop for  minor stuff. The engine and tranny are strong, though.  I've never had problems with the car running but I've had a bunch of other issues, the biggest one being the steering rack rattling (which was replaced twice). Recently I  got the head repaired. I drive the car pretty hard but I do take care of it. I do a lot of driving and she's been on long trips south numerous times. The inside is in mint condition, I make sure the fluids are changed and it's inspected by the dealer periodically.  I refer to put anymore money in it and will drive it until the wheels fall off lol.....I prefer to buy American cars, but they really need to do much better with their economy cars. If you're looking at a Cobalt, buy an SS model,  they were built waaay better....or just get a Honda or Toyota lol.",,

I recently got in an accident with it and it did not cost me more than 500 bucks to fix it myself! and it still runs awesome just like it did before! The manual transmission in it too makes it so much fun to drive and race others all the time cause im first off the line.

The first weekend I had it, I had to take it back to the dealer because it had rained where I live and my entire trunk was soaking wet. The rear windshield had not been sealed and they had to replace the carpeting in my trunk and rear dash board.Since then, my now three year old car has been recalled 4 times. In my opinion, that is excessive. I wish I could get every penny back I spent on this car, and to top it off, customer service with GM has been terrible.

I was lucky, but no telling how the next accident of this sort will end up. GM is totally unresponsive & denies any responsibility. Something had to be wrong with the vehicle!

The front of it is dated.. but the body itself is magnificent. It says 25 mpg BUT my readings say 23. The LS I purchased has no cruise control or power windows/doors. BUT. For the price of this car, it's great. Fun fun to drive once you get up in mph and it hugs the curves with its spoiler.

I get 40 mpg highway easily. For a relatively inexpensive car it handles great and has decent power. I live where it gets cold as hell in the winter and it starts every morning, and it does alright on the snow and ice. There is pretty limited storage space, and the blindspots are pretty significant. Everything seems pretty solid still. Of course there are little rattles here and there, but nothing crazy. Everything has stayed pretty tight and sealed up.

4.25,Good car for a good price,s1l3nt_1nc ,03/04/2012,,,4,4,4,5,,4,3,5,5,A good relieable fun to drive car for a good price. However I have run into some minor cosmetic issues. I have a Automatic LT model and the red light that shows you what gear you are in is stuck. The plastic clip that you press to change gears broke off and my trunk light no longer works. However it runs great and is fun to drive. Gas mileage is OK but could be better. Overall good for the price. One more bit of advice. Get a spare key! If your battery dies and you try to start the car your key will be stuck in the ignition until you can jump the battery. There is a way to manually get the key out but you would have to get into the steering colum to press a tiny button which is hard to see.,Good sound system. Sleek design.,More leg room for back passengers.

2.75,Too many repairs for a brand new car.,hdryder ,05/03/2011,,,3,3,3,1,,3,3,3,3,We have a 2009 Cobalt Sedan W- Auto Trans. Purchased brand new. It currently has 38k miles on it. This is the worst GM car I have ever owned out of the gate. Within the warranty frame it's had numerous failures related to cheap parts: Power steering motor recall. Steering column replaced because of a rattle. Ignition replaced because the key could not be turned off. The most recent is a issue yet to be diagnosed for certain but we are experiencing an erratic slapping noise coming from the drive train. I suspect it's a noise that originates inside the transmission. This car has long term durabilty questionability. Be prepared to spend $$$$ after the warranty expires. It's very cheaply built.,"Upfront quality is fine with this car. It's the long term durabilty I have in question. Any car that needs numerous repairs early on will probably need the same repairs again and again in the future. Warranty is fine but what about covering these parts that fail early for life. How odd it is that GM usually replaces a failed part with the exact same part? There is no proof that GM improved the replacement part. So when the part fails after 36k miles, the consumer eats the cost to fix a mfg defective part. Personally, I think this is very poor customer relations. ",GM needs to select durable parts.... not the cheapest ones they can find that will get through the warranty period. GM tests all their cars before they go into production. They know all the flaws yet they do nothing to prevent them. They throw these issues at the consumer. It's no wonder GM has irate customers and those who have left because of this very same issue.

I can maintain 40 mpg on a relative lt flat highway at 60 mph. I do not like the spare tire. There is none. Chevy now provides an air compressor with a bottle of stop leak attached to the compressor. What happens if I get a flat when it's 20 degrees outside? What happens if I get a blowout? I'm going to start calling junk yards for a real spare tire. It will fit in the spare tire wheel well.

When they hooked up the diagnostic computer to it, TWENTY possible error codes came back.

It does not attract attention, the interior does not communicate (steering wheel blocks freeway speeds and generally no useful notification system, trust onStar).  Step on the throttle and it accelerates very quickly, no 'bad boy' behavior, just the rush.  On curves, following instinct only, the posted speed limit is generally exceeded (significantly).

I could get 35 MPG if this were not a rental and I did not pound it.  I don't like the interior materials, but it is sufficient for most people.  I also wish the car had on wheel audio controls.  This is a very simple, clean, and functional car if you do not need to use the back seat.  I generally do not like GM, but this is a nice car for the right price.  Better to rent this than to own IMHO. ","The seats are fairly good.   The seats are fairly comfortable.  I am a big guy (5,11"" 270) and had a surprising amount of room.","The back seat is TINY.

I traded in my old Chevy Blazer for a more fuel efficient and safer car, and I am so glad I did. About a month and half after I purchased my car someone ran a red light and t-boned me. Both myself and my passenger were ok, and I credit that to my car. The time that my car was in the shop, I missed it.

The lack in braking with the LRR tires is also a bit of a drag. Got the XFE, and on the highway, it's getting an amazing 44 mpg. Overall I couldn't be happier. I love this car. Thank you GM for not going hybrid, and for building an affordable little mileage monster. I'm also way happy with what the base model comes with. Crank windows, manual seats.. no biggy. I love the DIC, and the stereo is great. While shopping, I saw others that wanted 3K for A/C, and used an idiot light as a temp gauge.

The cost of the Corolla 5 speed was 14,500 rock bottom price.  The Cobalt with all the same equipment plus onstar and XM radio was $11,000 before tax. PLUS the Cobalt is getting 39 mpg in mixed driving &ts not even broken yet.  The Cobalt is the way to go.","XM RADIO, Standard A/C, Onstar, 39 mpg, tilt wheel and lots of room inside.  The new Hubcaps are nicer too.",Better Quality door panels.  A soft touch Dashboard. I'd love a hatchback design similiar to the Dodge Shadow. 
4.625,So far so good,Cher ,03/27/2009,,,2,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Only had car for a few weeks, so I will write another review in a year. I may not know much about this car yet, but I do know that the gas mileage is fabulous. Better than any 4 cylinder compact car I have owned. However, that only goes for the manual transmission LS models. The manual transmission is fun to drive, it shifts smoothly and the engine is peppy. Great if you need to pass someone. The trunk is roomy but the back seats are not. Overall I do like this car. ","Great pick up for a 4 cyl, nice looking car, great on gas, smooth driving and shifting","Death by plastic! Less cheap plastic interior and more vinyl. Make seats more comfortable and not so stiff, it feels like the seats have died and rigor mortis has set in. Of course you get what you pay for and the Cobalt is still a good buy.   "
4.75,"Hated Chevy, But Now..",Crystal ,03/26/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,4,5,5,"In 2008 I purchased a 2007 Chevrolet Aveo. Never-again. I had it into the shop 15+ times in a single year. I swore I'd never buy another GM car until I laid eyes on the 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt LS Coupe.  I was drawn by it's style and yellow color. After test driving it and looking at the specs, my boyfriend and I decided we'd give GM another try. WONDERFUL, idea. I love its get-up-and-go power and handling. XM is awesome as is 1 free year of Onstar. This car has been completely reliable and I enjoy driving it. The price was reasonable, and the fuel economy is excellent. At 20 miles on the odometer when I first purchased the car I was getting 30mpg and it's still going up. Great car.","XM radio, Onstar, Sound System, Engine power, and vehicle body style.","Shifter difficult to clean, visors are cheaply made, and it doesn't say when a door is still ajar in a vehicle."
4.375,A Decent Car for the Price,Peter ,03/25/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,3,5,4,"The first flaw I noticed with this car was that there is a severe premium on storage space.  My map book wouldn't even fit in the glove compartment!  The (optional) arm rest storage compartment is a must-have, even though it interferes with the parking brake.  I found that the seat belt latch was located a little too close to the body and therefore difficult to access.  The seats themselves are comfortable enough and there is more than enough head and leg room (I'm 6').  The display module is located a little too low on the dash.  I found that it was obscured by the steering wheel spokes while turning so that the ""low traction"" warning couldn't be seen if you were turning on a patch of ice.","I have to admit, this is a pretty sharp looking car in profile view.  The stereo system isn't bad and is easy to manipulate while driving.  Fuel economy is fantastic.  Lots of room in the trunk.  60/40 split seats is a nice touch.  Aluminum wheels and power package are nice features for the price.","More storage space!  My old Sunfire was a warehouse compared to this.  Relocate the parking brake (see 09 Civic), it's a pain to have to keep lifting the armrest to access it.  Relocate information display.  Side-curtain airbags should be standard!"
4.375,Good value,AA ,03/22/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"Great price.  Overall good features with the LT package, great fuel economy, smooth ride and comfortable even for a tall person like me.","XM, Onstar, looks.","Better seats, don't use the low rolling resistance tires (they aren't the greatest in terms of grip)."
4.5,Nice Economy car for a good price,PD ,03/17/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"Just got the car today. It's a base auto with AC and ABS.  It drives and rides pretty good for an economy car.  Gets very good gas mileage so far 30+ mpg. Got mine for 12.5k which is a great price for a new car. Its not the most exciting car to drive, but that's not why I bought it.",Great gas mileage and decent ride.,Use better materials inside on door panels
3.875,SS coupe alot of car for the money,Tom ,03/09/2009,,,3,4,4,3,,5,3,4,5,The cobalt SS is one powerful piece of machinery. The handling and power you get is unmatched of any car at this price range. One free year of OnStar and 3 free months of XM radio really sweeten an already good deal. My friend is a real snob about cars and hates American cars. After showing him a lot of SS reviews and giving him a ride in my new car he has had to admit this is a good car. ,The 260hp and excellent handling/brakes. The sound system is great and has a nice amount of punchy bass. This car is fun to drive. ,The handbrake actually looks like male dog genitals. There are a few minor things that look unfinished on the interior. 
5,Excellent car,Roger ,03/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought a bottom of the line Cobalt for commuting. The price was unbeatable and the MPG is wonderful. Chevrolet has come a long way in quality. I have never really been happy with GM products , but this one changed my mind. It a pleasure to own and drive. The interior is wonderful and it has plenty of comfort. I love this little car and I'm glad I didn't settle for an import. Thanks Chevrolet. It's a wonderful and reliable car!",Onstar and Xm. The great value and good looks. ,None...I love it. 
4,Great Value,GV ,02/20/2009,,,3,4,5,5,,4,3,4,4,"I've owned the car for about a month and haven't got a single regret. Got the car at an exceptional price with all the incentives even though I hadn't planned on buying a car. This car is way quicker than my venerable '98 Sunfire and with way more ammenities for thousands of dollars less. The car is a pleasant surprise with all it's features, conveniences and style.","Engine performance is very good for an economy car. Like the OnStar, XM radio/sound system. The lumbar support adjustment in the driver seat works well. Remote start is great too. ",The interior is alright for an economy car so refining the interior would move this car up in class
5,2009 Nova SS,Lance ,01/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my SS Cobalt without driving one as every state west of the Mississipi had only 5 SS'.  I ordered one after reading my Road and Track, Motor Trend Mag's and going around the Nurmburing's track with a professional driver in the rain no less. Lap times just above 8 minutes, and the driver expressed great impressions of what the car is able to do. Seeing as how I want to do what I can to help the economy and own a true muscle car matching the numbers of a Buick GS 455, and getting 2 to 3 times the mileage I bought one. I have 4500 miles on the car, perfect seats that my 90 year old mother could actually not have pain after 8 hours in the passenger seat, and scarry fast, like-Corvette","Engine, transmission, linkage, seats, OnStar, XM radio. Insulation through-out, perfect balance and scary control at twice the suggested corner speed.","Keep the Corvette steering wheel and perhaps make the Chevy ""Bowtie"" a tad smaller, and dare I say easier to use information center."
5,Love my Lil Red Coupe,Kyle ,01/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I traded in my 00 Mustang V6 that was a piece of junk for this 09 Cobalt. It is my first new car and I am really pleased with my decision. The OnStar and XM are my favorite features plus the XFE sticker on the trunk is cool even though I'm not sure what it means. I assume it is the sport package? At 6'4 and 330 lbs I fit very comfortably and dont feel cramped like I was in the mustang. I drive 100 miles to college and then 20 to work. so the gas mileage is very important. I am getting double what the Mustang was. Great car and worth the money.,OnStar and XM,Make power windows and power locks standard
4.25,5000 mile Chevy Cobalt review,kochise ,01/09/2009,,,3,5,4,5,,5,3,5,4,Nice little car to get around town in. I don't like the seats or interior. I think the seats are made very cheap. I bought for gas mileage and the price range was what I could afford to keep maintained. I think the interior is really cheap.,The looks,Build a little better seats. Really bad cheap plastic. Seats are not comfortable at all. Hurt my neck after a long trip
4.875,Very happy,Dave Wny ,11/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"So far I love this car. Fun to drive, sharp looking and excellent fuel economy. I purchased the LT 2 door coupe with the automatic. Plenty of power for regular driving and the interstates. Passing power is more then good enough. I am getting lots of compliments on the style of the car. I got a black one with the 16"" rims and spoiler and chrome package. Lots of heads turn to take a look as I am driving.  Rides and handles very nicely.  It looks and drives great. I am very, very happy. No problems at all after the first 2 months. For the money it's an excellent car to buy. I am more then pleased. ",Style and the fun of driving a sporty small car again after driving an SUV for several years. Excellent gas mileage. The auto start and the XM radio are great features. Base radio has an excellent sound. Trunk space is very large for a small car. I am 6 feet tall and front seat leg room is great.,No real complaints so far. 
4.625,"So far, exceptional value",Jake ,11/14/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I also bought ""Go""balt during the GM employee price period. Nice incentive to get what turns out to be just about everything I hoped for, even the color I wanted - yellow. Great handling. Only 1600 miles but getting 27.2 mpg last check. Work ride between 40-50 mph at 60 miles each day. Would've liked hatchback. Rear deck just in the way & to hold speakers. Rear spoiler can block vision. I'm 6'-1""+ & seat is comfortable but I must cock my knees just so on entry. Interior a little chintzy but hey, it's a commuter car with go-power. The refig display is different. I have trouble reading it in the variety of color combos it offers. Currently getting dealer installed cat- back system. A kid at 58!","Turbo power, shifter, the color, nice wheels, moon roof","Hatchback model, ditch rear spoiler, maybe some leather in the seats & accent piping, don't know how but ""dress up"" the interior with some quality looking plastic!"
4.875,2009 SS Cobalt,Why Not ,10/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought the Cobalt SS Sept 15. So far Im very impressed. The turbo really helps the 2.0 liter create power. It feels faster, stops quicker and handles better than my 96 TransAm WS6 (and it was a performer in its day). The reconfigurable display is awesome, the Brembos fell like an anchor is thrown out to help stop it and it handles like its on rails. The seats feel great, standard bluetooth is cool and the short-throw shifter is outstanding. I've had Vettes, TransAms, and tons of 60's era muscle cars. At 54 years old, this car puts a smile on my face every time I drive it. With the GMPP plan offered last month, Im sorry I didnt buy two of them for $22,400.","Turbo engine, handling, braking, reconfigurable display, short-throw shifter, seats, standard bluetooth, steering wheel controls for multiple features and the stealth factor. ","HID headlights and a center armrest console with storage. I'd say ""more power"", but I've read Chevy has a Stage 1 upgrade kit in-work that will boost hp to about 315. "
4.125,My Cobalt Rocks!,HoosierDiva ,09/17/2008,,,3,5,4,4,,4,3,5,5,"It's a small car! Handles beautifully, the Ecotrac  whines a bit more than I like, but I love it! Having a compartment that is more easily accessed by the driver, yet secure would be helpful. the 'tray' under the Emerg brake doesn't 'corral' things well and they end up on the floor (not safe for drivers to fetch). XM may be a keeper and I feel much safer with the OnStar...some people may feel it's 'big brotherish but if big brother wants to keep tabs on my grocery store runs...he can help load and unload them! ....the dishwasher too! ...can drive me to work too!!","OnStar! Extra charging outlet, no cigarette lighter! Spacious trunk for a small car! Autostart rocks!","Either a side open compartment (armrest) rather than front open, or another secure compartment entirely for driver access (to easily grab ID's, cell phone storage, change, etc.) "
5,Wow,dale ,09/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Really surprized with this car. I needed an inexpensive car to drive to and from work. The gas mileage is unbeatable, it is averaging 39 mpg. I really like the 5 speed. It has plenty of power. This is a much better car than the Corolla I was looking at and a lot cheaper.","5 speed, CD player",Maybe thicker cloth seats
4.375,"Good, solid car",John ,09/13/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,5,4,"The driver's seat is very comfortable, the car drives good, rides good, and wind and road noise is minimal. The fuel economy is very good. The right rear speaker is defective, a new one has been ordered. One negative design flaw is that the arm-rest between the driver and front passenger seats has to be raised up in order to set or release the parking brake. A telescoping steering wheel would be greatly appreciated by long legged drivers such as myselg.","OnStar, XM radio, mp3 CD capability, hands free calling.","Make anti-lock brakes standard, make the steering wheel telescope as well as tilt, install a foot operated parking brake, make a compass, engine temperature gauge and battery gauge available."
