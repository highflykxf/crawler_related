3,Shame on Mazda,Ruthann ,10/28/2015,2,4,4,,,3,4,4,5,,,"I drove my car for a long time and was quite pleased.  It had it's minor issues but nothing major.  The one thing I kept having problems with was the brakes.  I took it into the mechanic 4 different times and they couldn't stop the squeaking.  The Mazda dealership later told us that's just Mazda brakes and they all do that!  That is not normal!  It was only when I backed up, but then started when I stopped at a stop sign.  I spent a lot of money trying to fix this problem, and I have yet to fix it.  The final problem was the transfer case.  The mechanic said it is designed very poorly because there is no way to do maintenance to it.  You just have to replace it once it wears out, and if you don't replace it in time then it is linked to the transmission and then you need a new transmission.  That is what happened to us.  You know there is a problem when the mechanic can't even get the part because they don't have enough parts because there are so many cars having this issue.  The final cost was $5,200, and the car is only worth $9,000.  It hasn't even hit 100,000.  I thought we bought a quality vehicle, and I really loved certain things about the CX 9, but I will never recommend this car to anyone.",,

But Mazda has a very poor quality. after about 30k miles, brake has some issue and costed me about $1000. after another 30k miles, all four tire sensors broke and tires kept leaking. That costs another $1000. The bottom line, if you don't want to get annoyed. Stay away from Mazda.",,

4.75,Practical yet cool SUV,tiruvan ,05/07/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of SUV's. But I got one since every other car on the road is a truck of some sort and in the event of a crash I want my family to be safe. The CX-9 was the only SUV that received 5 stars for front and side crash and 4 star for rollover in ratings. Reliability has been superb so far with regular maintenance.We drove the Pilot, Highlander, MDX as well and hands down the MDX was the best of the 4 but at $10K more than the CX-9 it was expensive. The gas mileage was lower as well. Pilot was too boxy and the highlander costed as much as the MDX (which is lame).After a couple years and 20K miles it's still as solid as the first day! Recommended!","Driving experience is superb! It simply doesn't feel like a truck. The 273 hp engine is plenty enough for a smooth take off and the disk brakes do the stopping job well.

The exterior styling is in the same league as X5 or Q7. It's stance from the side is as stylish as it can be done for a SUV.

Premium cloth is very durable and will hold off minor spills (if cleaned quickly). 

Dashboard is straightforward yet classy. The red lighted dash is well designed for ease of use and readings.

Third row seats can be adjusted very easily, they fold flat and are split 50-50 as well.

Per the SUV's reading we have averaged 18.5 mpg at an avg. speed of 29mph (mostly city driving). Fantastic mileage!","Power seats should be standard for your flagship car. Heated seats and mirrors can be optional though.

The seats could have a bit more cushion in them.

Black colored floor mats are almost always a bad idea. Customers should at least have a second choice.

Cargo area mats could be made of a better material or at least make the rubber liner standard.

Few more cup holders wouldn't hurt.

Third row should have it's own a/c vents."

With the AWD version, it feels like the car is driving on two rails it holds the road so well.  The interior is luxury-car quiet.  Very little road noise.

Very sporty.  The std. blue tooth is a nice touch.  My wife LOVES this vehicle.  So glad we didn't get a Pilot or Highlander.

Performance is great with more than enough power and fantastic handling for a vehicle this size.  Incredibly smooth, sporty ride.  It drives like a performance sedan.   20"" wheels provide an athletic look in a relatively unique vehicle.  Build Quality and fit/finish are solid.  Interior styling is tasteful, and traditionally modern.  AWD worked great in the 2 blizzards in DC this winter.  Seats are comfortable on short trips and long hauls.  I guess mileage is not great, but not a lot worse than the minivan it replaced - you have to pay for the driving performance somewhere. It's a great CUV.  Kids like it too.","Blind Spot warning is quite useful, Big wheels, Heated seats, 3rd Row, power litigate.  Outside Styling, inside styling.

This is the bust CUV in it's class. Mazda knows how to make great cars. Acceleration, ride, handling, interior space, standard features, and interior design are better than all the rest.

Acceleration is more than adequate, interior space is aplenty. Suspension is a little stiff but bearable.  Handling is outstanding, you would never know this car is a large crossover.  City fuel economy is poor averaging approx 13 mpg, but highway is excellent averaging almost 23 mpg at approx 70 mph (close to EPA 15/21 mpg estimates).  Haven't snowed in NYC yet so can't comment on the AWD system. Plastics around the steering wheel and dash is rough and cheap making it hard to wipe (use lint free cloths).

We needed an SUV with a true third row, and this was the best option (the Acadia and Enclave were not being leased at the time).  Although I find the interior fairly comfortable, it does not compare to the Lexus RX 350 we had before this car.  Also, the fuel economy is horrible -- I average 14 MPG with combined city & highway driving.  My husband has a Toyota Highlander and gets much better fuel economy.  Needless to say, this will be our last CX-9.  ",Comfortable ride,Better fuel economy; less cramped center console and glove compartment.

Exterior looks great.  So far we have 2k on it and it rides and drives as good as our Sonata did.  Handles like a sedan, but you can pack the kitchen sink in it.  Great hiway cruiser if you stay away from the 20"" wheels, plus the 18"" on the touring won't cost $200+ to replace and they look just as good.  Overall very impressed.  Snagged one of the last 09's in the state, discounts and rebates marked it down almost 6k off the stickers.  2009 looks just like the 2010!  Don't see many on the road which is nice, people always asking what we are driving.","Ride and comfort.  Cruise is spot on and easy to use.  Love the sliding second row.  Buy the Mazda winter mats...they are way worth the money and fit like a glove.  Pick up is good, you don't have to hammer on it to get up to speed entering on ramps.  Bluetooth is amazing and STANDARD! Rear heat/AC","Broken record...gas mileage.  But for a big 7 seat suv there are not many options that are better, and I wanted a V6.  Standard CD player with 6 speakers is a little weak for a $30k plus vehicle, but do sound good if not pushed hard.  Could use a couple more storage spots."

The Pilot drives like a truck - not that different from my Ford Explorer. The CX-9 drives like a performance tuned car. Easy to get in and out for all seating positions, tight handling, good acceleration and smooth and quiet braking. The Pilot looks like it should be driving through the Texas ranch-lands, while the CX-9 is right at home next to the Cayenne's and Q7s in the Costco parking lot. All up, the CX-9 is about $5k less than the Pilot. Most of all, the CX-9 feels safest for kid hauling, and is a lot of FTD.","Nav, Bluetooth, BSM, 20"" Rims, AWD, manu-matic tranny, purchase experience and price paid.","Door edge protection, body side molding, turn auto-lock on by default (having that programmed today), include the crossbars for roof racks, put a power liftgate button outside the car, add a mute button to the audio system, mod the audio controls so I don't have to see all of the surround sound opts"

4.625,2009 Mazda CX-9,Dave ,10/19/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"After 5500 miles the CX-9 is proving to be an excellent family vehicle. Even the third row seats are suitable for short trips. For a 7 passenger SUV the acceleration and handling are outstanding. The interior design is up to that Acura and Audi standard. I test drove the Acura MDX, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander. All of them are nice but the combination of price, design, size and performance made the Mazda a clear choice for my family of 5. Bottom line, I enjoy driving it and my wife appreciates the design and space for shuttling children. ",Interior design. Acceleration and handling. 20 inch wheels look great. The blind spot warning system has surprised me with how well it functions. It lets you know when a vehicle is in your blind spot. A nice safety feature during highway driving.,"Interior storage space is lacking, especially compared to Honda Pilot.  We averaged 17 MPG in the Expedition we traded in and thought the Mazda would be significantly better but we are only averaging 19.5 MPG.

Drove Mercedes, Lexus, Cadillac, Audi and Volvo, none compared on interior quality and exterior style to the CX- 9. Top that off with a price which was minimally $10K less than anything else, and you have a real winner.  GT package does shift the ride quality to the firm side, but the handling achieved more than compensates.

It was more of a ""let's take a look so we can eliminate one more option"". But when you get behind the wheel and give this SUV a good look trust me if you buy another SUV I will be shocked.  It is as close to perfect as you will find. It is simply THE best kept secret in the mid-size SUV/Crossover market.  Great size not to big not too small.  Usable third row with as much legroom as many full size SUV.  Great build quality.  Smart engineering and logical design/layout.  Drives as much like a sports car as possible in an SUV.

We've also filled the 3rd row with teen-aged friends with no complaints on in-town trips.

However, when you look at what you'll actually pay for them, the CX-9 looks much better.  It appears to be the value leader - very nicely appointed, sports-car zoom-zoom handling (which you won't find in the competitors), and feature laden.  Even my skinny 7 year old can slide the center seats to access the rear (she couldn't do that in the Tahoe we had).  Speaking of the Tahoe, when we compared them side-by-side, the CX-9 has more depth behind the rear seats, and has more depth when the rear seats are folded.  I wouldn't have believed that if I hadn't seen it myself...","Sporty drive - in a class by itself here; not bone-jarring, but no cushy luxo-cruiser.  The seats are great and the interior lighting is a nice touch.  Fit & finish is very good.

It has a sporty body style, and the 20"" rims just sweeten the deal!  The 2nd row can adjust, so you can move the seats up to make extra room for the 3rd row.  The 2nd row seats also partially recline which is a favorite feature for my kids.  This car is definitely fun to drive.  It's smooth!  Even with 20"" wheels, it's still a smooth and comfortable ride.  If looking at the CX-9, definitely check out the Grand Touring, the options are great!!","Navigation system, Back-up camera, Advanced keyless entry, Bose Sound (awesome!), Power Liftgate, Bluetooth, Blindspot Monitor, Dual Temp controls for driver/passenger, Leather seats, Integrated garage door opener, AND we had Remote start added, and it's awesome!!!  Love, Love, LOVE my Zoom Zoom! :)","Sure everybody would like their vehicles to get better gas mileage.  I haven't found anything that I would change on this car, so far."

5,Road Car,Traveler ,08/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We wanted a road car to replace three previous Buick Ultras.  We drove GMC, Chevrolet, Saturn and Hyundai SUV's. The wife did not want a 'bus' feel and when we drove the CX-9, it hit the mark for size and comfort.  We have over 11,000 miles in ice, snow and 100-degree heat and lots of night driving.  The Xenon headlights are a true plus.  The 20-inch wheels give the vehicle the stance and driving feel that we really enjoy.  We have commented several times how much we love our '9' and do not miss our three big Buicks.  One minor recall for power seat cable placement - other than that - she goes!!","Xenon Headlights, Blind Spot monitoring, large wheels, cargo space, quiet interior, great feel for the road. Have driven in 30+ mph crosswind and is very stable, even around semi-trucks.  Punch it and it goes.  Great transmission and shift-points.",Compass.  Deeper second seat cup holders.

4.75,best large 3-row Crossover for the price,jc ,08/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,Basically a acura mdx for someone on a budget like me - get some great features and utility worthy of luxury- level vehicles for an affordable price.  Fuel economy is the big downside but no vehicle in this class is any more impressive.  I can honestly say this large cuv is pretty fun to drive... Easily comparable to my 05 murano even though it's bigger.,"bluetooth everything, blind-spot side mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, power- lift rear hatch, lots and lots of room, no better styling in its class.","fuel economy, very strong A/C fans (although can be a good thing on a hot day), somewhat dim interior lights when headlights are on during pseudo-dusk times of day."

4.75,Best CUV for your money,Duayne ,07/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I test drove many and this car was the clear value leader (IF you can still get the generous discounts). Safety was a high-priority and the CX-9 has every safety device/feature available on vehicles under $50,000 - except Daytime Running Lights!? Excellent handling/steering. Design and features impress everyone from teens to middle-aged. To be sure, it rides a little rough on typical streets -- you will feel all the bumps -- but has the most comfortable car seats I've ever sat in (and I don't have leather). Maybe the best thing is that it's a big car, but doesn't look or drive like one. No car is perfect, but the minor annoyances on this one are more than made up by the outstanding ones.  ","Handling and maneuverability. Bluetooth operation. High visibility (both by driver and being seen by other cars). Seats and dashboard. Heated mirrors to clear fog and ice. Automatic climate control. Storage room behind 3rd row. Cruise/Radio controls on steering wheel. Orange instrumentation, for now",Better fuel mileage & larger gas tank. Sirius radio should be standard. Better stereo controls and speakers. More room for driver's left foot and right knee. More upfront storage areas. Doors should lock automatically when you start driving and unlock when you pull the handle. Smoother acceleration.

4.5,Thumbs Up from my teenage daughter,Shawn Faunce ,06/05/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,4,5,4,5,"Normally we travel on long trips in our Grand Caravan, but on this trip from Detroit to Mackinac over Memorial Day we drove the CX-9.  My teenage daughter that seems to complain about everything these days had nothing but praise for the CX-9.  So did the other kids. Despite being smaller, it really felt like there was more interior room.  I couldn't believe all the luggage and the people I was able to haul comfortably. Much more fun to drive than the mini-van too.",Hands-down the easiest bluetooth paring I have ever dealt with.  The cruise control was so easy to adjust that I was able to cruise most of the way up and down I-75 on Memorial Day weekend with the cruise on.,"For as much as it costs, there are a few interior pieces that just seem very cheap."

I can't believe I wasted a year of car payments on the Hummer.  After driving the Grand Touring model I was sold.  The ride is superb and the features are great.  I thought I would miss the Hummer but I was wrong!!  ,"Bluetooth, Removable DVD/nitendo system, Smart key, blind spot monitoring system","Fuel mileage, ease of getting in 3rd row, doors should lock automatically once car is in drive"

Touring edition has some nice features that cost more in other models.  Definitely better than highlander or the pilot. Lots of room, great bose surround system.  Comfy ride.",Overall build quality and design.   BOSE centerpoint system.  Nice leather quality. Drives like a big sedan.,"Can use a smoother acceleration, need more cup holders in the rear. "

4.75,Like it a lot..,ray ,05/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"It was between the 09 Honda pilot and the cx9 and for the price the cx9 won out.  I would have spent over $40k to get the features in the cx9.  It is really fun to drive, smooth, comfortable and quiet. Brakes really Nice and after 4 months without it being cleaned, I have very minimal brake dust. Haven't had any problems so far. I had a durango before the cx9 so it does sit quite a bit lower.","Blind Spot Monitoring, Backup Camera, Auto lights and wipers, bluetooth","stereo sound could be improved, those Bose speakers really stink. gas mileage could be better."

The radio features allow easy reception anywhere, the seat is very comfortable and the Bluetooth will end up saving my life. And so very, very fun to drive.  Researched to death and came down to this or the Highlander. One look and I was in love.","Bluetooth, Bose stereo, feature that pre-sets stations as you're just passing through a town. Smooth ride and silky steering. Seat more comfortable than my living room. So much space can fit my 6'5"" boys in the back and my shorter girls in the way- back with room to spare.","Biggest complaint is with the lock convenience. Locks and gas tank switch hard to access. Doors should unlock when you open the door and auto lock when you start.  Not much storage up front.  Variance on backup camera is large. These are minor issues - otherwise, it's perfect!"

4.125,Great alternative to the minivan...,RCKS ,03/14/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,4,4,3,4,"We have an 11 month old baby and another one on the way so decided to trade in the Saab 9-3 sportwagon and look for something larger. Minivans were out of the question so we looked at the crossover segment and settled on the CX-9 GT AWD. We chose it primarily for it's space, handling and exterior style. So far we have not been disappointed. It's comfortable,  easily stores the family and our gear and is actually fun to drive. It's also a stylish looking vehicle and way more interesting than a minivan.","Enormous cargo space with the 3rd row down, ride height (perfect for getting the baby in/out of the vehicle), sliding second row and reclinable seat backs (excellent for infant and toddler car seats) and smart key.",Better gas mileage.

4.375,"Wife Loves It, I'm Not So Sure",tabjaxx ,03/03/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,3,3,5,"Our search came down to a used 2008 Ford Edge or a new 2009 Mazda CX-9.  The Mazda won out because of the favorable lease terms that were being offered. The car is fun to drive and the engine has plenty of zip. The transmission is silky smooth. Drives like a smaller car, even with third row capacity. Ride is on the stiff side. Engine is quiet. Form and fit are good; no rattles. 3rd row offers nice space, but seems to do so at the expense of the 2nd row. The width of the driver's compartment is cramped. Not the easiest car to get in and out of (watch your head vs. frame). Console storage not good considering space it takes up. Gawky radio nobs on dash. Nice car, although I'm not wowed by it.","Dual temperature controls, peppy engine and smooth transmission, great exterior styling, steering wheel controls for radio and cruise control.","So far, the windshield wipers are bad at clearing ice and snow.  Gas mileage is not the greatest (17 mpg city/ 20 mpg hwy). Make the drivers cockpit wider.  Add auto doorlocks and headlights. Orange instrumentation can be obnoxious at times. Move all seating positions back 4 in. for better access."

My children can't wait to get in it everyday. I think it helps that it has a DVD player. I could not believe everything we received in our new car for the money!

4.625,From Gernan to Japanese!,YoVinnie ,02/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,After 3 years in our BMW X5 we chose to go a different path with our purchase of a 2009 Mazda CX-9. What a delight it is to drive and we can't believe the creature comforts! Tight but kind suspension and great get up and go when demanded. ,"The nav system is truly a wonder!

5,My favorite car so far,Mr T ,01/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We are expecting our second child and our Mazda tribute is now too small when carrying people around (we had to drive two cars). So we started looking for a 7 passenger vehicle, the choices were between the Pilot, Highlander, Traverse and the CX-9. The Pilot and the Traverse had finishing touches that seemed cheap, the Highlander exterior design seems as it did not know if it wanted to be a truck or a car so it chose something in between. At the end we got the CX-9 because we qualified for the 0% APR and no money down. Hey why pay cash when the bank is giving you money for free! So far no buying remorse.","All the technology: Bluetooth, integrated garage opener, satellite radio, navigation, back up camera, blind spot sensor. And the exterior design is just beautiful. The 0% financing plus 500 cash-back and 1000 loyalty bonus went a long way to make this an easy decision.",If Mazda offered a hybrid powertrain or a turbocharged engine in the CX-9 there would simply be no competition.

4.875,The Little Things Matter!,Mr Rob ,01/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We've had the CX-9 for 10 months after reading favorable reviews on Edmunds.com. I have to say that the reviews were spot on as this has been the most fun to drive vehicle we have owned in the last 10 years.  Handling excellent, and everything remains ""tight"" and well engineered.  Well done, Edmunds, for making such an accurate recommendation!",Six speed transmission is silky smooth.

5,WOW - A MUST DRIVE,Larry ,01/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After several months of looking at all SUVs and X-overs I selected the CX-9. Am I glad I did - the build quality, workmanship, features, value, fuel economy (first 240 miles city with 62 miles freeway got 18.5 MPG!!), fun to drive, and performance all add up to a best in class up and down the price scale. Much better than all contenders.  This is a little known gem that will have a very bright future as soon as folks get to know and see them on the road. Outstanding lines, sports car handling, family friendly, equally at home in a tux or Levis.  This is a rare find in a market cluttered with ""me too"" and ""ordinary offerings"".  A must drive if you are in the market, no disappointments here.","Outstanding Blue Tooth, build quality, seating comfort, back up camera, Zoom Zoom performance all the way.

The suspension is tight, handling unchanged, pretty zippy for a big SUV with a small engine. It really turns heads.

5,Excellent Bang For The Buck!,Steve Richards ,11/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just bought and so far, am VERY impressed with my CX-9.  It replaced a 3 year old Volvo XC-90.  Feels solid, drives great, looks great and I actually prefer it over the Volvo.  Plenty of room inside to buy just about anything with the seats down.  Rear seat heat and a/c is actually effective.  Keyless everything is great.  For the price, it can't be beat.  I looked at much more expensive vehicles including Audi, Mercedes and Lexus and aside for the interior wood trim, softer leather and a little extra glitz in these high end crossovers, the Mazda is a winner and represents incredible value.  It really has everything you'd ever want.","Size (nice and big), styling, generous optional equipment, excellent stereo, beautiful rims, handling, bluetooth, rock solid feel, blind spot side view mirror system.",Steering wheel is a little thin and stitching a bit bumpy although I can live with it.
