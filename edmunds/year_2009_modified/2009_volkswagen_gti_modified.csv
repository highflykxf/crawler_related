5,I have had many Golfs,Sheila Bernstein ,09/30/2015,5,4,5,,,4,5,5,4,,,"I bought this 2009 GTI used in December 2009. I love the Golf, have had several regular Golfs and this is my 2nd GTI. I love the GTI, it feels like home when I sit in it. I call it my bye-bye car, because that is what I say to the people behind me at the traffic light. The pick up is fast, and I am gone in a flash! Have to be careful of speed traps because it is so easy to start speeding in this car without realizing it! I have gotten so many compliments on this car especially men, they love it! I have the white one with the plaid seats, I guess it catches the eye. I have not had any of the issues others are writing about, I did have to take it in once because my engine seemed to mess up once, could only go 20 miles an hour and lights were flashing, there was no reverse, scary! But I shut it off and when it started, it was okay again, the dealer said they could not find anything wrong and it has been a year and it is working just fine. The handling is tight and it hugs the road like no other car that I have had. This is my retirement car, so I am glad I love it! Test drive a GTI, you will not be disappointed!",,

4.75,Great fun with utility and economy to boot,scottie3000 ,07/17/2012,,,5,5,4,5,,5,4,5,5,"I have owned this car since new and took delivery in Feb 09. I have had the computer re-flashed to make more power, and I think this is how the car should have come from the factory. It is a claimed 300 lb/ft and 250 hp. The torque is what is great about this car. Just push the pedal and it goes! No drama, just thrust. I average about 29 MPG overall through mixed driving.Issues: My brake pads in the front did not engage the rotor fully, replaced bythe dealer and now they're great. Random rattles in the dash and rear seat area.The transmission occasionally jerks when pulling away from a stop.No reliability issues and these have been very minor for an overall good car","Engine torque, fuel economy, cargo capability","A taller 6th gear would really improve hwy driving. Milage drops off sharply after 70 mph due to the high speed of the engine at cruise speeds. Make the 6th gear taller by about 15% and this would be a perfect car. 

My suspension damper rates are somewhat harsh over slow-speed sharp edged bumps. I drove a 2011 GTI and it is much better. "

5,Understated Elegance with a load of Zip,macdawg ,05/24/2012,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've owned a lot of cars, but none have captured my heart like my Red GTI, with the six-speed manual. Have had it for 5 months, and put on 9,000 miles, with not a single issue, other than too much fun. I have to keep myself from making up reasons to run errands. Versatile, balanced, beautiful, compact but solid, easy to park, it flies like a mother, and is equally composed when cruising in a 25 mph zone. More fun to drive than my old AUDI A4, comparable to the 3-series we had. I'm not sure I'll ever want to own another car than a GTI.","I thought it was funny what reviewers said about the steering wheel, until I actually drove this car, and then I realized what they were talking about. I love the way it looks--the honeycomb grill, the blade wheels, it's like a shrunken down X3. The clutch and gearbox are remarkably forgiving for a car of such a sporty nature. It's almost impossible to make a bad throw.","Nitpicks: because of the slope of the doors, when it's raining, the windows have to be up, or water gets in. The audio could be a little better, but then again, the overall experience of driving this car is so pleasurable, I can hardly complain. I've been spoiled by my Mark Levinsohn Lexus audio."

4.125,Hated to see it go,cibaknife ,07/08/2011,,,4,5,3,1,,5,5,5,5,"First let me say this car is a blast to drive. Economical on gas, although it requires premium. Almost Audi-like quality for a much lower price. The most entertaining car I have ever had. I looked forward to driving it. The hatchback versatility was great. Now the bad: the first battery lasted about a year and gave out in the middle of a road trip. CEL came on another trip for an intake sensor. At 50k miles the intake manifold had to be placed. At 55K the mass airflow sensor went. Dealership had poor service. I got the car back from them and sold it. I don't have time to sit in a VW dealership or be without a car for weeks at a time. Hated to see it go, though.","Awesome drive, hatchback versatility, gas mileage, the sound it makes under acceleration, fat steering wheel felt great, front seat comfort outstanding.","Reliability.

It has been one year, and already I have had about 3 major repairs done to the car. The car is great to drive, very fun, but I guess in my case very problematic and have been to the dealer with repairs in the last year over 7 times.  From electrical issues, to an intake manifold being cracked from bad mold casting, to air conditioning falling apart and need replacement.   However, I do recommend you purchase an extended warranty and VW has completed all repairs, but as far as satisfaction with the car. I am VERY VERY displeased and dissatisfied.

4.75,possibly the greatest daily of all time,eldaino2 ,03/23/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"i can think of a more unbeatable combination of style, performance, and daily driveability. if you want a sport compact that can haul stuff, and people, efficiently, quietly, stylishly and look just at home on the track or local meet as it does taking your wife to a nice restaurant downtown and your kids to school, this is it. it strikes the perfect balance between sport and comfort (with a lean towards sport). other cars like the speed 3 and cobalt ss may be faster and handle a bit better, but they are by small margins, and those margins are not big enough to overlook what the GTI offers compared to those vehicles. a one trick pony it is not, but it very well may be the best dd of all time.","EPIC high speed stability, perfectd crash test scores, flawless and high quality interior (best in class), potent amounts of low and mid range torque, quiet, perfect ride handling balance, wonderful exhaust note and the seats and steering wheel are second to none. oh and the plaid is the way to go.

5,Wow fun in this pocket rocket!,Larry Orischak ,01/27/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I love this car! I looked at everything in it's class and just kept coming back to it! Have had for a year and it is still fantastic experience! Handling is superb and gas mileage is a real surprise and no On highway crossing Utah had cruise control set at 82mph and was getting 27 miles per gal. Around town 32 miles per gal.plus. Pick up is terrific and blows me away! and handling is tight and responsive! Seats are excellent for quick turns and no problems on long trips. Space in back  is probably bigger than anything in it's class. Dash and controls are easy to read and to control.  I have had some great cars in my 45 years of driving but this is the most fun yet!

4.875,The best adult hatchback in the group,Mark ,05/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I really wanted a smaller car, with decent gas mileage, good performance and a somewhat upscale feel without spending 40K. I also need a back seat for occasional passenger transportation. I looked at the civics, and just could not do it, it's seems like a kids car to me, I also looked at The toyota corrola (better gas mileage, but the most boring vehicle) absolutely no fun to drive. After test driving the GTI, I was sold, it was perfect, sporty, but comfortable, easy power, not a brute, easy to maneuver in the city, quick acceleration for passing and the best interior of the cars I tested.

5,Nothing short of Amazing,Vanbosch ,05/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded in my 2008.5 Mazda 3 Hatchback for my 09 GTI. After driving my wifes 09 Rabbit I was sold on VW's build quality and driving dynamics but wanted something sportier than my 3. I absolutely hate the boy racer look of the new 2010 Speed3. I got an amazing deal on my GTI and haven't stopped smiling since I parked it in my driveway. The new GTI is one of the best purchases I have ever made and have zero regrets trading in the Mazda. Volkswagen has earned a life long customer from my wife and me with their fun to drive, reliable and well built vehicles. The GTI satisfies in every way. From the precise handling to the punchy 2.0 Turbo engine and quality feel, I could not be more pleased.  ","VW build quality. Everything about my GTI feels solid. I love the response of the 2.0T, sharp handling of the drive train and excellent driver feedback. The car lets you know exactly what it is doing without being harsh. My Mazda always felt unsure when pushed. Not in the GTI! Simply an amazing car","None. If you are considering a fun to drive, economical and reliable daily driver look no further than the Rabbit or GTI.

Good power, no turbo lag, good handling, nice interior with lots of room, good fuel economy, and it feels & drives like a more expensive vehicle.  It may not have the outright power of a WRX, but the refinement and fun are a great combination for me.  It handles great, is quiet going down the road, and I'm getting mileage in the mid-20's around town.  It inspires confidence on back roads, and never feels like you are asking it to do something it doesn't want to.","2.0T TSI engine, uber-cool plaid cloth upholstery, supportive & comfortable seats, refinement","Brake pedal feels a little soft...it works great, but could use a firmer feel.

Everything feels very solid and I can say the seats are very comfortable.  I would opt for the 6 manual, but I have heard from other owners that the DSG was a blast.  I am not a big fan of the plaid...so I opted for the leather...more power options for the seats would be nice and I dont like the roll switch for the heated seats (but they do work good).

Handling is very good for FWD car and DSG transmission is awesome.  Lightning quick shifts.  Interior has nice materials and good ergonomics. Seats are great as is the steering wheel.  VW got the big stuff right with the GTI.  Unfortunately, the little details are what they missed.  With only 1,000 miles on the clock my seat squeaks, my dash squeaks over every bump, my rear hatch rattles over bumps and there is an engine rattle between 2500 and 3000 RPM which is an issue with other MKV GTI's too.
