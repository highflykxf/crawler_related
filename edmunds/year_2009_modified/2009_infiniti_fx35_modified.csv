The sales team of Dan and Dave worked with me and my budget to get me into an upgraded 2009 model from a 2007. Very happy with the car and the professional way I was treated during the entire buying process.

You people are freaking picky. The car is [non-permissible content removed] its fast, comfortable, and reliable.I looked into alot of SUV's and this one is by far the best. X5, M-B, Porshe is a joke. Just the interior on the FX alone is better then these cars. ive had this car for a few months and its been very fun to drive. its like buy a 350Z but a SUV body. if your old and not into sporty cars, dont buy this.

This was a prime consideration for me Great looking (and unique) exterior, beautiful interior - although I would prefer a bit more of the Maple and Aluminum trim, and it could really use some additional leather on the door panels at this price Milage is disappointing - have never gotten better than 22 mpg (and is generally 17 - 18) with AWD.While power is very good - milage is less than my previous M-B E430 4MaticLimited luggage space compared to other SUVs - but this is an OK trade-off since it handles a LOT better than other SUVsDealer experience is not up to M-B","Superb handling - very close to sport sedan.
Comparable to BMW X3 and Audi Q5.
Far superior to Lexus RX and M-B GLK.

Adaptive cruise control. I never used Cruise Control until I got this.
Set it and forget it.

Fantastic instruments and center console.

Fantastic compromise between a sports car and a traditional SUV - totally meets the needs of empty nesters with no children

Unique style - not another slab-sided derivitive looking SUV.

Interior is far superior to Lexus and M-B.
Different than, but competative with BMW and Audi.

Easy to use driver interface for touch screen (phone, audio, climate, etc.)","Heated seats are terrible, especially when compared to M-B or Audi.
Barely get warm.

Needs improved lumbar support for driver and really needs lumbar support for front passenger seat.

Needs self openng and self closing rear hatch.

Should add Blind Spot warning system similar to Volvo's BLSS

Need to be able to input data into touch screen while vehicle is moving - absolutely stupid to have to pull over when a front seat passenger could easily input data while vehicle is moving

Would like to see fuel economy get up to at least an average of 22 - 24 mpg (I am averaging 17 - 18 mpg overall; with a best of about 21 - 22 on highway)

Dear infiniti, you tried and failed miserable on manufacturing a 7 speed transmission. Mercedes can make 7 speeds, Lexus can make a seamless 8 speed, but you infiniti are poor at making a 7 speed. Why does this car shift into 7th gear at 25 mph? Whoever is reading this. this car looks nice, it looks sexy, the interior is gorgeous, but only because of the transmission do not buy it.

Throttle and brake responses are a little touchy, the ride can be bad on bad roads but is normally very compliant.  Drivers position, height and controls are very comfortable and well placed.  Cabin is snug for a SUV but near perfect for the Sport SUV it was designed to be.  Not overly impressive in any road comparisons to a car, yet if feels very sporty in every way and is very enjoyable to drive if you need a SUV but want a sports car.  Fast or slow I average 20 mpg and have had no problems other than a dealership that seems to think they are the only ones in town.  Cool Ride!",Drivers position and controls are near perfect to me.

I agree with ""Rick"" - 7 speed tranny ruins the overall experience of owning this car.  Shifts all over the place (I have the latest transmission flash) and still show very harsh downshifting after releasing the gas pedal (this initially scared the daylights out of me when it first happened, now I just come to expect it).  Only ""DS"" (Drive Sport) mode returns control to the driver and allows you to get around horrible gear ratios and indecisiveness of the computer as to what gear the car needs.  Also, brakes are VERY soft - takes longer to stop and gas mileage is mediocre.  No tranny change 2010 so if you consider buying you're warned.","Exterior and interior design are simply gorgeous.  Awesome integration of bluetooth and iPod connectivity with the radio/navigation system.  AWD handles great in wet and snowy weather (I have the standard 18"" wheels) and climate control works great.",Top priority needs to be on fixing the 7-speed tranny gear rations and shifting issues!

I purchased the FX35 for it's reliability and I wanted as much of the RRS handling and size as I could get. The FX didn't infatuate me, I just needed out of the RRS. I am now in love with this vehicle. Handling is not quite to the level of the RRS, but the ""fun to drive"" factor/cost goes to the FX35. The shifting issues are mostly resolved with premium fuel. My fuel economy of highway/city mix is a steady 19MPG! I feel this is good for any vehicle with this speed/performance/AWD. I look forward to my drive everyday! The FX35 is just easy to love.

3.125,TERRIBLE TRANSMISSION,Rick ,12/27/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,1,3,1,1, The 7 speed transmission is a disaster.  I took it back but they said the software upgrade was done. It shifts up to 7th gear by 40 mph so if you come to a hill you have to take it down 2 speeds otherwise it struggles.  Constantly shifting and the tranny brakes the car when you take your foot off the gas.  IT RUINS THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE OF THE CAR...VERY DISAPPOINTING.  I'M READY TO GET RID OF IT ALREADY ...HAD IT 3 MONTHS.  I got the Premium and Deluxe wheel package...both worth it and very nice.  Seats are hard.  Bluetooth is nice.  Wood trim is beautiful.  Design is cool.  Have to take tourneau cover out to get groceries in.,Design.  Display for radio/cd/phone.  Bluetooth.  Horsepower.,Should have electric lift gate for the price.

It shifts way too slow when you need it. Really almost 2 sec pass, the rpm jumps and then it moves.  2. Air seems to find its way in to the Gas tank causing a lack of seal, sets off ""check engine"" light.  3. The heated seats start tricking up, they work, they don't, then they do again... go figure.

2.625,Shame to Infiniti ,Infinityfan ,12/01/2009,,,4,4,4,1,,1,5,1,1,"This is my second Inf after '04 FX, which I really enjoyed. I got the new 2009 FX35. I have never been so unhappy with a vehicle's performance and fuel economy. My old one was showing about 13-14 mpg mostly city drive and new ""IMPROVED"" shows the same, driving experience horrible, unless I drive about 70-80mph. In slow traffic the shifting is all over the place sometimes it feels like someone bumps you behind. Also maybe because car is to heavy or because of transm issues, when my car starts driving it feels like it's choking on fuel.

4,Brutal 7 Speed Transmission,Unhappy ,09/09/2009,,,4,5,5,4,,3,4,3,4,This is my first Infiniti. While I enjoy the unique exterior style of the new SUV (as well as some of the gadgets) I must admit that the 7 speed transmission drive train leaves me speechless... in a bad way. The transmission wants to shift into high gear (7th?) at road speeds of 25mph. Even in DS mode it is not appreciably different. And if you have to climb any degree of incline at 25mph... wow... the vehicle labors vigorously. There is no downshift without pressing the accelerator halfway to the floorboard; at which point the RPM goes to 5k and the vehicle lungs forward. I hope they do some reprogramming of shift patterns.,Back-up cameras and highway performance.,Re-program shift patterns. I am told that the quick shifts were required by California vehicle standards. Note to Infiniti; people outside of California buy these things and expect better performance.

The car is great fun to drive.  The exterior takes a bit of getting used to, but the interior is class all the way.  There were two significant issues.  The first is rotten rear visibility - either you get used to relying heavily on the rear view and birds-eye cameras or you don't.  The second was the transmission.  It tended to search for the right gear, refuse to change quickly when floored, and just shift roughly.  But there is now an available transmission re-flash (reprograms the computer) - ask about ITB09-032.  It works wonders, completely solves the problem.  Thanks, Infiniti!","Beautiful and comfortable interior. Powerful engine, very nice audio system, good GPS.  Drives like a sporty car, not truck-like at all.

I had to have what was marketed as a new and improved FX for '09. I think the new styling is incredible. However, I have never been so unhappy with a vehicle's performance. I'm beside myself - I just threw away $40K+. In slow and go traffic, the shifting is all over the place while it attempts to find the right gear. Unless I'm able to drive aggressively, I find the 7-speed transmission unacceptable. From a stop it performs great. Once at about 22 mph is where I realize issues.

The car downshifts and accelerates in traffic at the same time and it's in gear 6 or 7 when you're driving 30 miles.

Interior layout is very clean & well thought out. Everything flows perfectly.  I know some don't like the exterior but it has grown on me. I would recommend getting the Deluxe Touring package which gives you the 20 inch wheels. The 18s are a bit small compared to the size of the FX.  All the tech features work well. The Nav has room for improvement. You can't use the all the features when in motion. The search function needs to be more customizable.  Its 7spd tranny is way too slow to respond. It hunts for the right gear in traffic. It has slipped a couple of times. They should have left the old 5spd in.,Interior layout & tech features. Seats are very comfortable. Around view camera is helpful.,The gearing for the 7spd needs to be revised. It shifts to 6th gear once you let go of the gas. Highway passing is dangerously slow.

I end up using the paddle shifters to make the trans do what it should be doing on its own. I was thinking it was only my car and maybe something is wrong with my trans, but I see that someone else had the same issue. ","Voice commands, keyless entry, navigation and real-time-traffic, internal hard drive, iPod connection and around view camera.","Reprogram the transmission, smoother ride."

4.375,Almost,Jonathan ,09/22/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"This is a replacement of my 2005 FX35, which I liked this has improved comfort, seats and ride.  My main problem is the awful 7-speed transmission, badly programmed.  This is supposed to be a sporty car.  The car only accelerates smoothly when rapidly accelerating. Accelerating from about 25 mph or 45 mph requires full accelerator to get a downshift or nothing happens quickly. Around those speeds the transmission cant seem to make up its mind and makes it hard to maintain a constant speed with frequent downshifting. I have never owned a car with such inconsistent throttle response.",,

4.75,My New 2009 FX35,Mike Sheridan ,09/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I love this vehicle!!  I test drove every SUV on the market before buying this one.  I drove the Porsche, Benz, the Toyota, Lexus, Ford, Dodge, and the BMW.  None compare with the comfort and goodies that come with this one.  Did I say I love it?? I owned a BMW X5 before buying this vehicle and there is no comparison in the ride, feel and comfort.  This vehicle is by far the most outstanding of all the SUVs on the market. ","Voice commands, handling and ride, keyless entry, navigation and real- time-traffic, internal hard drive (I've loaded all my CDs and there is still plenty of space on the hard drive).  iPod connection.",USB thumb drive connection.  Customization of the voice commands to allow for tuning to a favorite station by voice.  Easier sorting and access to the stored albums on the hard drive.

4.75,Great Upgrade from my 1st Gen 2003FX!! ,NEGOC8R ,09/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Traded in my 2003 fully loaded FX35 for the 2009 with everything except for DVD this time.  Like others wasn't crazy about looks such as grille and new color choices but, my Mojave Cooper w/mad-frown and wide arched hood has really grown on me. The DCA technology is the most impressive, actually pushes back off gas pedal and applies brakes when it detects a car in front, even in stop and go traffic. Other music and nav tech features are really fun. I don't understand how they made it faster and yet get slightly better MPG too, have not averaged below 20 yet after 2K miles. Braking and handling has also improved much over my 2003.   ","Distance control assist, rain sensing wipers, paddle shifters, iPod Interface and recordable music hard drive.","Auto gate lift gate,  stereo w/improved subwoofer & headrest DVD option, and trailer hitch pre-installed."

4.75,2009 Infiniti FX35,TulsaFX ,08/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,I traded a 2005 FX35 for the 2009 FX35.  At first I wasn't crazy about the looks but the much improved interior and ride comfort outweighed appearance.  Now after having the car a month I really think it's cool.  I really loved my 2005 and would have kept it had Infiniti not made such great improvements.,"Voice recognition, sound system, iPod interface, bluetooth, nav system","Automatic liftgate and fold down rear seats like what's on the Murano, gas mileage"

4.875,An honest review of the new FX-35,Happy FX owner ,07/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I am a previous FX-35 owner.  I recently upgraded to the 2009 version.  The ride is MUCH smoother compared to the previous model.  The technological advances are amazing.  The navigation system is better than Lexus.  The radio is fantastic, including the iPod interface allowing you to fully manipulate the iPod using the Infiniti screen.  The tip-tronic shift system is fun to use.  You can use the stick shift or the paddles next to the wheel to up shift and down shift.  The interior and dash board are much nicer now.  I highly recommend the navigation system and the Technology package.  The dynamic cruise control is very useful.  I would VERY highly recommend this car, no questions asked. ","iPod controller, dynamic Cruise control, tiptronic shifter via shift stick or steering wheel paddles, dashboard with multiple colors not just yellow, heated and cooled seats, lane departure system actually helps to compensate for poor attention span, all-around camera view is very helpful","The trunk space has a built in expandable ""box"" that takes up excess room.  At this point it is truly hard to think of any improvements"

4.75, A delight to own and drive.,Pat Davis ,07/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Road performance outstanding by any measurement. Handling, acceleration, braking all exceed previously owned similar class vehicles. The obvious concentration on fit, finish, interior design  and updated electronics set off by the very pleasing and contemporary exterior combine to provide an outstanding ownership experience.","Handling, design and versatile electronics including navigation, information, front, rear and side obstacle visual and oral presentation.",Exterior mirrors should fold automatically with engine shutdown. Fuel consumption needs reduction.
