4,Rogue Scholar,Rita G. ,05/09/2016,4,4,4,,,4,4,4,4,,,"I bought a used Rogue.  I zeroed in on it for a few reasons.  First, I had a budget and a reliable used car is what I was looking for.  The Rogue was a vehicle that I researched a few years ago.  I like its versatility as an SUV.  I like that it is not too big, not too small, cute looking, handles like a car, there are a few minor vibrations at higher speeds,  but all in all a great deal for the vehicle.  It was in terrific shape, brand new tires brand new front brakes and 7/10 on the rear brakes  with the exception of some scratches that came off with your typical scratch remover and one ding with minor rust that I have a $500 quote to repair (needs body work) and I am planning on keeping it for its second 100K miles.  My son uses it to go to work when home from college, but I'm finding that I'm using it when he's not home to do 70 mile round trip commutes, trips to the cape (250miles)  and even weekend warrior errands.  It has become my go to car when it is available and will be my husband's car during winter snow storms since his car is a RWD.  We had a Nissan xterra that lasted us 200K miles so I'm feeling pretty good about its prospects for reliability.  All in all a great car and a great deal.  It took some getting used to the larger blind spot and the clock is an electronic clock that is starting to fade a bit, but this is a great car despite those two minor issue.  I think I might need a muffler at some point in the future since the original has some rust, but again, I knew what I was getting into buying a car with 94K miles.  So far, no issues at all.  Update. Well I had an axel and fan replaced in August so I spent about 1600 on those repairs. Other than that the car is running good. We have about 103k miles on the car now.",,

5,Great little SUV,Brant ,10/31/2015,5,4,5,,,5,4,4,5,,,"Bought this Rogue for my daughter 2 years ago.  It was very well cared for with 95,000 miles.  New brakes, tires, and all scheduled maintenance was done.  We have had no problems (ex a torn axle boot) in 2 years and 22,000 miles.  This is our favorite car (we have 4) as it has a great balance of economy, handling, comfort, and build quality.  The interior is quieter and classier than the CRV or RAV 4.  Plenty of room to move the kids in and out of college.  When I drive the car I average around 27 mpg both city and highway, not bad for an AWD SUV.  The handling/ride combination is good.  The car is quite nimble compared to by 2003 Lexus RX 300.  Ours has all options but for NAV so there is little lacking.  We will consider another used Rogue when one of our other cars needs replaced.  Living in New England the AWD is a must.  I would personally prefer to drive a car over most SUV's but not this Rogue.  I honestly like the car that much.  As of October 2016 now have 131K miles on the car and all is well.  No problems and still drives well.",,

Love the gauges, interior lighting and comfort (I'm 6'2"").
Car is solid and seems built to last.
Leery about the CVT but Nissan has acknowledged the problems and extended the warranty to 125K miles, I believe.
Gas mileage is commendable for an AWD SUV.","Not much - The CVT does seems to bog down a little at slow speed but once use to it no problem.
Every car has its quirks and I like this car, and being a car guy through and through, that says a lot."

2.625,Dont buy a CVT Nissan,bteeley ,09/02/2013,,,3,4,4,1,,2,3,2,2,"The car is fine.Its a bit loud, not very powerful.On one had compared to its peers the interior it is well built.The transmission failed a few years ago, the dealer replaced it under warranty with no issues.Now, about 60k miles later the transmission is failing again, it sounds like a truck, the issues are well documented and the dealer tells me it is normal.Refusing to do anything to resolve the issue.After owning the car for 4 years there are many other vehicles I would purchase over the Nissan Rogue. Initially, I really like what Nissan is about, ride quality, reliability, etc.But I will not purchase another one.Search the net for CVT reviews before you buy.",,

4.5,Great Car!and a must own for any looking in this class!,englddriver1 ,08/07/2012,,,3,5,5,5,,5,3,5,5,I have to say after reading some of the other reviews I laugh at what people find as annoying...Claiming there AWD doesn't work when they don't lock it? Or the fact that they think the car is a 4X4. Nissan/Infiniti AWD is one of the best in the world and as a long time Infiniti owner of the M class X series I love there AWD and I live in snow country.We purchased this for my fiance as a baby is on the way and wanted a great MPG Cross over.We look at the Infiniti Cross over but my Fiance didn't like any of the looks and felt it had to many gadgets. So we went with the SL AWD Rogue and she loves it! Great MPG love the CVT tranny fun on highway and holds well in the snow for the high RMPS.,"The MPG..As a M owner I get 22MPG out of a V8 so this is a treat when having to take a long trip! 

Best AWD(NOT 4X4)Out there. Those who don't know this is the same as the GTR it's an intelligent AWD google it! Also make sure you have either a nice All season tire or Snow tires makes a world of a difference.

For a 2.5V4 it has plenty of Pep! as I stated I drive a new M with a V8 that has tons of power but this little thing gets up and goes and hauls in the snow!",The interior is just bland.This car doesn't fool you about it you know it's nothing special but a A to B Car.Maybe give a navi and few other luxury toys inside that are common in other Nissan vehicles.

We live in Utah, we have snow, mountains etc. and the AWD is awesome!So far... I highly recommend this car.If you asked me one issue i MIGHT have is the blind spots in the car.The way the back end is formed may make it difficult for a amateur driver.I personally don't mind it, just use your mirrors.Hope this helps.

The interior although well made is plain and simple. The car performs well but I would not call it fun. It is reliable in every respect but there is nothing to get excited about. But after 18 months, it has grown on me as being a very good all around good, practical, safe, comfortable, and reliable transportation.

I could not duplicate the key problem for the dealer, but it was getting frustrating. I removed the battery in the controller and bent the 3 contacts up slightly at the folds, using a small pocket knife. It has improved 95% and contribute some to junk in my pocket. I improved my blind spots by installing small rectangular stick on mirrors to my side mirrors. I still look back when I pull out, but it does give you more visibility. I'm 6'2 and I have more leg room than most vehicles. It has rapid response in emergency conditions.

If you want good, safe performance  in the snow get a AWD vehicle that engages and stays engaged in AWD/ 4x4.It was new to me  so an expensive lesson!

After test driving it, i was really glad i came to the Nissan dealer. It drove great, looked great, was extremely smooth and quite and the best part, was much cheaper than a similar crv/rav4. After owning a SL with premium package and sunroof, i am glad i purchased. We just love this vehicle, its smooth drive. It averages around 26 - 27 mpg. Great features.

4.125,Watch Out from Behind,sw1974 ,08/20/2010,,,3,4,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"I bought my 2009 Rogue S used with 14K miles on it. I had researched it & heard about the rear view issues, but WOW! It is bad. The blind spot on each back corner is a complete design flaw and must be fixed with larger windows in new versions. It's not so much the back window as it is the 2 small side windows. It's a real danger if you ask me, but the rest of the car is fine. I had an 07 Honda CR-V before this one and they're comparable. I don't mind the CVT transmission and feel the car accelerates better than my CR-V did. I have had no issues in these first few months. Gas mileage is great.  AC is COLD, which is nice. The sound system-- the factory version, not Bose--is still good quality.","Cold AC, cloth interior easy to clean, flat folding back seats.",The back side windows are too small. The visibility issues are real and need to be improved without a doubt for safety purposes. You must learn to drive with both mirrors and turning your whole body.

Not so lucky; car worked for a couple of days then wife called from out of town with the red key warning light glowing in the dash as she hummed down the interstate praying the car would not stop and lock down on her as it has done in the past. called dealer and they had no idea.Took the car on 2,500 mile trip in dec. and many things happened.from not letting us in to not allowing the ignition switch to turn to unlocking itself while we were away from it.

4,'09 SL AWD 9 months and rolling,sschrupp ,12/24/2009,,,5,5,4,2,,4,4,3,5,"Overall I'm pretty happy with this vehicle, but no longer quite as ecstatic as I was in the beginning. Within a couple months of driving the trans started making a chattering noise. Dealership replaced the trans. Now they need it for about 3 hours for various recall issues. The Bose stereo sounds like all the sound is focused on front center speaker. The headrest is uncomfortable, and doesn't stay down, always slides back up. The sideview mirrors whistle at higher speeds and gusts of wind. Gas mileage isn't great, but hilly area with 65+ speed limits accounts for that.  On positive note, it rides smooth, accelerates nicely, looks great, handles like a pro, great in inclement weather.","Bluetooth phone, AUX function on stereo, decent bass on stereo, nice exterior styling, bright headlights, keyless ignition. Traction control system is excellent.",Fix the headrest. Feels like it's shoving my head forward so my chin is touching my chest. My Bose system doesn't seem to be tuned for a surround type setting.

3.125,Not bad but terrible sealing,Young ,12/14/2009,,,4,3,3,3,,4,3,3,2,"Overall performances are acceptable. Three major problem. 1. Free penetration of cold air through knobs and buttons due to bad sealing 2. Noisy in wet days due to same reason. But Nissan consider it as normal, which means it is their limitation in technology 3. Very bad rear side-view visibility. You'd be very careful when you try to change lane. There are much wider blind area than any other car due to very bad visibility. I almost hit other car several time in 3 months driving, which I have never experienced before with other cars in my 30 years of spotless driving history. So, not recommended for young drivers.

Stumbled upon the Rougue and found it to be every bit as good as a CRV which I previously owned and better than the Toyota.  Toyota and Honda would not deal but Nissan came down $6K off the list last August and that clinched the deal.  About 12Km now and no complaints other than gas mileage not quite as good as I expected it to be.  Its versatile and fund to drive both in the city and on the highway.  Always admired the looks of the Merano, this shares many of those good looks and makes RAV 4 and CRV look dated.  ","Moon roof, AWD, stero system, fun to drive.",Needs a Hatch latch.

The inside is very sporty gray and black. the Bose system is awesome if you love music and blue tooth on steering wheel is a great safety feature, I wish my wife had it in her car. I also drove the Santa fe and Tiguan. Santa Fe was boring but a lot bigger, Tiguan drove nice and had a lot of power for 4 cyl.They are a bit more money and less features though.

For starters the engine is loud, really loud.  Almost to the point that I'm waiting for an explosion to happen when I hit 4000 rpm.  Fuel economy is great (considering I went from 16 mpg to 23) and the ride is quite comfortable.  The price, well I still think Nissan could have done better with the S type.  $19000 is a bit much for just about the same stuff you could get in a Sentra.","Tons of head room and a fair amount of cargo room for a crossover.

Blind spots are awful, rear window is way too small, backing up is a pain... (I understand now why my insurance went up after I gave up Jeep Liberty for Rogue). That small orange, round shaped computer screen is annoying after a week of looking at it, it's so cheap and like an alien to the rest of dashboard. Suspension is weak to my taste. Lots of road noise when on poor pavement. With high speed and gusty winds vehicle behaves strange least. When you close your door it sounds like something loose inside. Ignition/access key is huge and ugly. Steering wheel, cruise.ctrl buttons, speakers/sound are poor quality. Etc.",Accelerates good for 4 cylinders. Roomy. Enough space in the trunk to bring all gds from Costco. Steady ride uphill on 65-70 mph. Relatively quiet on smooth roads. Seats shaped OK. Stops good. Observation: it feels like many (any car) reviews you can find on-line are hidden promotions actually. No?,"Can't name 'em all, not enough space here. Here is one though.

It had good mileage (for this class of vehicles) and, in fact, we are getting 26-27 in town and close to 30 on the road. It has the clearance and AWD we needed for moderate off-the-road usage (wildlife surveys, kayak in-putting, etc.). In addition, it is very comfortable and quite quiet on the highway. Handling is better than the other compact SUVs that we tested.

I had a chance to take it out for an hour on the hwy. It was great. At first I left the radio off to hear the possible noise issues other have said. After I stopped focusing on the noise. No problem for me. Lots of pick up. NOT going to miss my Tribute. The Rogue takes corners so well. I can feel that car feeling. Love the option from automatic to manual shifting. Works well for that extra kick you might need the odd time. If your more aggressive you would  tend to use this more so. .I did push it around the corners getting off the hwy.

The seat adjustment controls, power steering and dash controls are basic.  These features may be available if you purchase the premium package.
