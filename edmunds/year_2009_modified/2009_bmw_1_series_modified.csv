5,The greatest toy I own,Kevin Gregor ,07/29/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I'm only writing a review after reading so many people either complaining about the size of the back seat, how low the car is, or about an option that they chose to go with.  It's a high performance coupe, expect it to be low and have small back seats.  You knew this when test driving it and it was YOUR choice!  It's not the cars fault you didn't pay attention.That being said, the 2009 135i 6 speed manual is an absolute beast.  Not to mention they are quite rare on the east coast so people notice a nice one.  I'm a male in my late 20's and I've had this car for 4 years.  This car is a rocket and handles like nothing I've ever driven.  The 2009 comes with the twin turbo N54 engine which is the best part.  It's practically the same engine that is in the new 2015 M3!  Just putting a chip in the car increases horsepower by 80-100HP to the wheels!  When I bring this car to the track, I leave M class BMW's in the dust.  After a few modifications this is actually the fastest car I have ever been in.Power aside, the trunk is quite large and the back seats fold down.  I fit a brand new 55 inch TV (still in the box) into this car.  I've also fit 4 brand new 18 inch rims/tires!  You'd be surprised on how much this car can fit!  I also have my friends in the back seats all the time with no complaints.  The issue is that the driver and passenger tend to have their seats further back than needed and don't realize it!I can honestly say that this car is the greatest thing I have ever purchased.  If you are in a similar situation as me, don't have kids, and like a beautiful interior/exterior with insane power.  Look no further.  One quick note:Run flat tires come standard on this car and it makes the car drive stiffer due to the sidewalls of the tires being harder.  If you replace them with regular tires (which are way cheaper in price) you'll find it drives much differently.  I prefer the regular tires and I'm willing to accept the risk.  Keep in mind that this car does not have a spare tire!",,
3,a mixed bag,mrh1965 ,05/21/2013,,,4,,,3,,4,2,,,"I've been driving my '09 128i since October of 2010.In that 2.5 years I've only put about 17-18,000 miles on it.I make a lot of short trips so my average mpg of about 18 is a little disappointing but not real surprising. The car is a little hard-riding and the stock seats are not particularly supportive or comfortable.Those are probably my two main complaints with the car.Reliability is a concern, too: replaced the lifters, the a/c evaporator, the radio, the third stop light, etc. Thankfully this has all been cheerfully replaced under warranty. This is all balanced by the gem of an engine, good visibility, good looks, solid handling, etc.I do love the little, fat, steering wheel!5/20/2016: Edmunds wants an update, ok.  I sold the car last fall, and I'm not sorry to have parted company with it.  I got tired of the occasionally harsh ride and uncomfortable seats.  Reliability remained an issue -- I'll spare you the details -- so I think selling it and getting into a Lexus was a good choice for me.",,
3,BMW buyer beware,projectnurse ,06/24/2012,,,2,5,2,2,,5,2,1,5,"We leased a 2009 135i convertible and just turned it in. This car had many problems over the 3 years and BMW did not meet our expectations in the service department. We had to take the car back twice for every issue we had and there we many. It was not ever fixed the first time even on a recall issue.Additionally, when we returned it with 12,000 miles after 3 years they charged us $600 for new tires on the rear of the car. The explanation was that because this car is a ""sports model"" the tires only last 12-15,000 miles. If you lease a BMW this means you will have to replace the tires at least 3 times during your 3 year lease if you drive it all the miles allotted.",Very fast!,"Very pretty car and fast but looks are not everything and speed only works if the car runs. 

I suggest that BMW train their dealers in better customer service techniques. We were treated poorly at the dealership in Greenville, South Carolina each time we went there. Since they were the closest dealer to us we had to endure their poor customer service even when we turned in the car. Training may help these people better understand how to treat customers. They could use a lot of help!"
5,l Get in and out of,butch ,11/21/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Got 6 speed 128 and love it.  But by far the main advantage for me is (being 6'2"" 220) the ease of getting in and out was final selling point.  by not lowering the roof line, which happens with other coupes, with the wide door opening make entrance easy. finally found a something that makes my 3 mile drive on  flat straight rode fun.","Door opening space, six speed manual ",Do busy enjoying it to think about improvements
3.25,No Working CD Option,SASS ,09/29/2010,,,4,4,1,3,,4,3,3,4,"The 128i is a cute car and should be an economical option to someone that wants to drive a BMW. However, there is a problem with the CD player, a replacement isn't available right now and there is no known date when one will be available. In addition, there are flaws in the dash board (which BMW won't warranty against rattles when replaced) and 2 recalls notices.

4.875,Excellent driving machine,Prof ,06/30/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The engine is a dream, and at its limits, you will scream. The exterior is old school but I think it's cool. It will look better with time, but does cost a pretty dime. Why not spoil yourself, who else will?",Engine.,MPG.
4.125,2009 128i review after 1 year,Howard Lynn ,06/18/2010,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"After owning my frist BMW for a year, it continues to be a blast to drive. At 6'3"" and over 250 lbs. finding a true sports car was a daunting task. Pros include good gas mileage[ave.25 per]excellent handling and great looks. Areas to improve : the sound system is just ok..not great. As well, my sound system refuses to play intermittently when it is hot outside. Three 'patches' later and the problem remains. They will NOT replace the radio as they believe it must be connected to a computer glitch. Another area to look at is the 2nd cup holder placement, which is mostly hidden by the arm rest. Basically, it will hold a Dixie cup. Lastly, an inordinate amount of engine heat is felt in the cabin.","Super looks!! Tight handling- typical BMW feel, favorable gas mileage subtle but nicely appointed interior Super standard items like the big moonroof, low pressure tire sensors and system check.","The Eagles run flat tires- great on dry smooth roads. Not so grand on wet/snowy or bumpy roads.HOWEVER- terrific mileage [est. 45-60,000 per set] Reposition cup rests, insulate, if possible, engine from cabin better so less heat is felt in the cabin,FIX the 'professional' sound system!"
4.125,Not Quite Excellent Yet,kjgood ,05/14/2010,,,5,3,3,5,,5,5,3,4,"Was forced by need, availability, and good price, to ""settle"" for the Steptronic instead of the manual; not sure it was the best choice.  Great power, but no limited slip diff makes wheels pin far too easily.  Both auto trans and traction control have various ""modes"" but not convinced any of them are ideal. Handling limited by crappy RFT OE tires. Exterior design is good from some angles but awkward from others. Excellent top; quiet when up, and retracts neatly.  Interior handsome.  Rides much better than my previous Honda S2K, but doesn't handle as well (not surprising).  Too many creaks and rattles for a car in this class, mostly around tops of windows when top is up. Fuel mileage is poor. ","Powerful and smooth I-6 turbo engine. Great acceleration.  Small(ish) without being cramped. Sport and Premium package features. Excellent convertible top. Nice ""finished"" look when top is retracted. Excellent seats - good driving position (S2000 is better though). ","Fix the rattly windows that so many 'vert owners experience; shameful in a $40K+ MSRP car (there would be talk of crappy Brit quality if this were a Jag). Limited slip diff, please! Ditch the RFT tires, put on better OE ones, and include a spare tire. Restyle the sides to eliminate ""cat's belly.""  "
4.625,Outstanding car,Larry Fitz ,05/13/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"We bought a left-over 2009 in February 2010 from Autobahn Motors in Ft. Worth for $7K under MSRP with shipping to California included. Main options: 6-spd auto, sport pkg, leather, heated seats. We test drove:  128i, 135i, 370Z, and G37 Coupe locally before deciding on the 135i. By far the 135i has a great combo of sports car feel, powerful acceleration, handling, fit & finish, appearance, comfort, practicality, interior space + window visibility, and price. We have >2,000 miles and have had no reliability issues, to date. Top speed 120 mph, to date. Auto trans is very good. The audio/speaker system is poor. Mileage is about the 18/28 as advertised.

4.5,Great styling!!,128i ,04/28/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"Being about 6'3'' and weighing in at about 265, there aren't many performance cars that can comfortably seat someone who is 'big. HOWEVER, this car offered me more head room than my traded in almost new Americam made truck!My 2 adult sons osed to call my trade in lots of very nasty names and finally I decided to buy my dream car before I expire. The standard package is impressive on the 09's and the car has handled very well. I get 24 mpg on normal driving, which is not too bad.The sunroof is enormous and one almost feels like he is riding in a convertable. A blast to drive, the 128i is a terrific entry level car.","The sound eminating from the exhaust, the heated seats and intermittant wipers.","More than once, my wife and I have felt heat coming from the engine. Nice in the colder months...not so nice during the summer... The tail end gets loose in snow.

4.375,My favorite car,JamesE ,03/14/2010,,,5,3,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"This is my third BMW, my first was a 320i in college. My last car was a 2001 325CI. I found the 325 the antithesis of the 320, it was bloated. I was hoping that this car would be a modern 320. It's not, its still too heavy. But honestly with this engine, I could care less. I didn't think that I ""needed"" a 135, but a got a great deal on one and took it. I still don't need this much power but it is a blast to have. The handling blows everything I have ever driven away, a lot of my friends have M3s and honestly I think this handles better and it rides way way better. The iPod, Bluetooth, all the goodies are well designed and work perfectly.  I'm waiting for a disappointment but haven't found it yet.","Engine. This engine is something else. Get the goodies, BMW should make them standard, but I think that this car is selling so slowly that you should be able to get them for free if you deal.","More interior storage. Its ugly, I got mine in black with the Sport Package so it kind of hides the lines, but its ugly on the outside."
4.75,135 vs a4 cabriolet,verne rind ,03/08/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I had a 2002 Audi TT roadster, my wife was concerned over its size, I bought a 2005 Audi A4 cabriolet 3.0 FWD sport package and CVT trans. It was a good cruiser but too polite, it always felt heavy. I just bought a 2009 BMW 135i convertible, Sport package premium package with  6 spd. I love this car. I think the criticism of the 1 series stems from the base models some can look a bit plain. In sport trim they are beautiful. A friend has a 2010 boxter S and could not walk away from me.

4.875,The Perfect Size,Michael ,03/01/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I eagerly awaited the debut of the 1 series here in the states after having read much about the European model.   After test driving the 1, it was clear that it would become my new driver.  Beautiful throaty exhaust note, rock solid build quality and the legendary BMW straight six makes it a dream drive!  I much prefer the size of the 1 series over that of the 3, and to me, it is the spiritual successor to the original 2002. ","Gorgeous coral red leather, integrated iPod connectivity, and BlueTooth.  I also opted for the HD radio.  ",A tweak here and there (perhaps 7 speed transmission) to get a bit better gas mileage. 
4.875,A Real Enthusiast car,Barry J ,02/16/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"In the past I owned four BMW e46 M3s and they were all exhilarating to drive with awesome performance. The 135i I now own is as fun to drive as the e46 M3 beating it out just slightly from a performance standpoint, which says a lot about the 135i. It's  a smaller car than I usually own, but it's nimble and sticks to the road like glue. The large brakes are definitely needed to stop this beast when it's hauling down the highway, and the exhaust growl when driving in Sport Mode is an aural pleasure. Fuel economy is okay, just about the same on the e46 M3, but my wife's 335i coupe gets a lot more MPG. ","Performance, acceleration, braking.",A little better interior styling.

Excellent manual transmission but this has been a heartbreak car.  Reliability has been poor.  Within three months, fuel pump went out then the tail light went out.  Dealer failed to fix it the first time.  Lots of creaks and rattles when road isn't perfectly paved.  Handles well but there is more body roll than I expected.  Also, heater puts out cool air from the vents except on highest setting.","Acceleration, manual transmission are great.","Reliability -  I don't trust this car.

4.75,Feat of eng. & a work of art,arnoldisnumerouno ,12/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Simply, I love this car.  The 128i has plenty of power and the handling is second to none.  Shifting is incredibly smooth and you can stop on a dime.  There's nothing I would change about this car performance-wise.  The 1 series exterior look may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think it is beautiful.  And I think BMW's interiors are the best in the business.  Plus, there's a million 3 series on the road, why not have something unique? I gave slightly lower marks on the comfort only due to the small backseat.  I never have anyone in the backseat so it didn't make a difference to me, but for anyone who needs to drive others should take this into consideration.",The attention to details!  Simple and elegant interior w/ the classic amber BMW lighting.  I think the armrest is in the perfect position for shifting.  Perfect size/thickness steering wheel.  Great sound system.  Very accurate automatic temperature control.,"Gas tank could be two gallons bigger.  Can't see the top of the gauges with the steering wheel in lowest position.

4.875,"Powerfull, small but big enough",Larry ,11/02/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Made a switch from Audi because we wanted a small coupe. We have a TT and it is wonderful but does not have usable back seat. We got the M package of the 135i. This car has a very smooth powerful engine. Turbo lag is hardly noticeable. Took it on a 1100 mile trip and found it to be a very nice drive. Quiet, comfortable seats, small and maneuverable.  It is a great car.  Run flat tires have not been a problem so far with only 4000 mi. I would buy again only I would not buy jet black paint.  It shows everything and scratches easily.","Smooth engine delivery. Fat steering wheel, comfortable seats, small and pointable, very fast.",Run flat tires only because the choices are very low for replacement at this time and they are expensive.
4.75,Great Little Car,PW ,10/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"First BMW I owned.  Was hesitant at first because of reliability issues but so far have had no problems.  Gas mileage in the city is poor (avg. about 15 mpg), but gas mileage on the highway is great (avg. 31 mpg).  I have the sports package with 18 inch wheels so the handling is fantastic.  The car is so fun to drive and I love the small size of the car.  Why are new cars so large these days?  Used to own a TSX (good car too) but this car is so much more fun.  Also, The RFT tires don't really bother me at all.

Also, I am very disappointed that the mirror on the sun visors do not have lights. What a bummer for such car! Response is awesome compared to the MINI but the mileage per gallon consumption went down 25%. The handling of the car does not compare with the so much fun go- kart driving of the MINI.

I'm not claiming the vehicle is ""perfect,"" but it's as close to perfect a vehicle as I've ever found.

4.5,Thriller!,Greg D. ,03/26/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"OMG!  I bought my black on black 2009 BMW 135i coupe a little over a month ago and have put ~1600 miles on it to date.  This is THE most fun car to drive that I have ever owned.  I have owned more powerful cars, more comfortable cars and better handling (just a little!) cars but this is the first time that it has all come in the same small package.  Plenty of low-end torque and horsepower, reasonable gas mileage (if I keep my foot out of it which is impossible!), comfortable on long trips and around town and absolutely gorgeous looks.  I was at the racetrack recently and my car was parked next to much more expensive and exotic cars and guess which car got the most attention?  The 135i!","Torque, horsepower, handling, looks, comfort, 6 speed manual transmission, excellent brakes, performance package and the thrill factor!  Also, there are not many of these on the road so you don't see yourself coming and going like the 3, 5, or 7 series.  I can't wait to do a track day with this car!",The standard radio really stinks considering sound systems available today... BMW should do better.  Finding one with the 6 speed manual transmission was almost impossible.  Finding one with the other options that I wanted (upgraded stereo and power seats) was difficult without a several month wait.
4.875,Perfect combination,Chris V ,12/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I had my eye on a 135 ever since the first time I heard they were cramming a 300HP I6 into a car that weighs as much as a Dodge Neon. Add BMW's legendary handling, massive brakes and you might just have the perfect small sports coupe. The real added bonus for me was that I get 25 MPG combined hwy/city, the interior is attractive yet functional, and the all season tires I needed for northeast weather don't detract from the appearance. If you want to take it easy and enjoy a comfortable ride, the 135 won't disappoint. But if flat out exhilarating performance is what you seek, I'd strongly recommend you purchase a 135. Oh, and befriend a state trooper unless you actually like going to court.   ","Awesome power, comfortable ride, functional interior, unique styling. 300 lb/ft of torque at 1700rpm is something you experience, not explain. ",Not too keen on run flats but so far so good. 
4.875,Effortless power,Mario ,11/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"While motoring over 60mph in 6th gear (~2,500rpm) a swift thrust of the right pedal puts you over 100mph in the blink of an eye, the twin turbo moves without effort, when starting from zero, you'll have to switch to second way before the you see the tacho grazing the redline, as 1st gear will be over before you figure out you're getting close to 7k! I gave it a 9 on performance because there are more powerful cars, not in any way because the power is any less than excellent.","Looks, engine, roughish drive, fits like a glove, electronics (iPod, bluetooth, etc.), engine sound, the way the manual tranny lever vibrates while idle!!","Less traffic, more roads, work farther from home, minimum speed limits. Ha!"
4.625,No Compromise,yakdad ,11/24/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,3,5,I wanted a two seater but my wife wanted four seats to haul grandkids. We compromised on a 135i BMW 1 series. We have driven practically every other two seat and four seat on the market and both think this choice was perfect. Solid sporty performance and the 300 HP is more than enough to make one take notice. My first time through the gears (we got the manual transmission) on the highway rendered a speed of over 100 without blinking an eye. The back seats are more roomy than one would expect. The sport package seats are comfortable on long drives of more than two hours. Top down driving spares passengers from too much wind and the wind deflector actually works although it's not very pretty.,"Power, performance, gadgets- Bluetooth, iPod, rotating headlights for turning, top down climate control. All in all the car is just fun to drive.",Car gets a bit pricey with options. Pretty up the wind deflector.
