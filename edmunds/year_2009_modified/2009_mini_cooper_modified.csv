5,Made me a customer for life,Mini lover ,10/22/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,5,3,,,"I fell in love with first drive.  I have always loved the look and idea of a MINI and I am a small car person.  I bought this mini used 6 years ago with the basic mini with minimum features because it was what I could afford at the time.  It was a stickshift.  I loved driving it, it made driving fun again because I hate to drive at all.  Then I became a mom and decided that I didnt want to buy a new car yet because I didnt want another car payment ( I dont like to drown in car debt).  It was difficult to get my daughter in and out with the car seat but once she was old enough to climb in and was forward facing, it was fine.  Overall very minimal cost as far as repairs, minor maintenance.  The only thing that went wrong was my radiator got a crack because I drove it too rough in the snow and jumped a curb.  I was going to keep it until it died but 2 weeks ago, it drowned.  My car got stuck in a flood and was totaled due to hurricaine Matthew.  Best part is, I got double the amount back for the car from insurance! It was paid off and still held a great value!  Needless to say, Im buying another MINI! But Im getting a clubman ( better for kids).",,

1,Worst decision ever,Dan ,09/30/2016,1,1,3,,,1,,,3,,,This car never stops breaking. Every repair starts at $500 and Geo's up. There is always at least $1500 worth of work that needs to be done. Do not buy this car!,,

2,Maybe New But Not Ever Used,Carly ,09/02/2016,,,,,,,,5,4,,,"I bought a 2009 Mini Cooper w/ 92,000 miles on it-- major mistake. If you're set on a Mini like I was, only buy or lease a new one because when they are close to 100,000 miles they need lots of very expensive work.Minis are super compact which means when a mechanic needs to get to say, the water pump, he has to take out other parts which results in much higher labor costs. Plus, the parts are expensive.Bought it for $7500, put a couple thousand dollars into replacing the water pump, water pipe, radiator, thermostat, AC, brake rotors, and battery...and two years later could only get $1800 after the transmission went out. I had it inspected prior to purchase and pretty much everything checked out, other than the mechanic saying I'd need new brake rotors.Don't make the same mistake. Minis are SO fun and great for parking and gas, but the cost of repairs on an older Mini gets to be traumatizing. They're just not meant to be driven past 95,000 miles.",,

1,A TRUE MONEY PIT!  Buy Anything Else.....,Luther McKeehan ,11/27/2015,1,3,2,,,1,2,4,3,,,"I have owned almost every type of car known to mankind and with one exception (67 Porsche 911 S) this is the worst car I've ever owned.  Maintenance cost are through the roof, parts and labor extremely expensive.  BMW sold the car with a long term KNOWN engineering defect (poor timing chain design) that has motors blowing up all over the world (ck the internet) at between 55k & 65k miles.  While maintained to absolute factory standards, mine blew up at less than 30 mph with 60k.  After fighting with the company for over 9 months (while I made car & insurance payments and had to acquire an additional vehicle) they only agreed to pay for the $11,000.00+ repairs after I recorded a series of conversations which proved I'd repeatedly been lied to and my attorney told them ""fix it today or we file tomorrow!""  The local dealership was super but BMW calls the shots.  Although they finally did agree that it was a design issue in the end they refused to reimburse me for the towing and miscellaneous out of pocket cost which had been promised to me in every single conversation.  BMW Corporation, in my humble opinion, is run by a bunch of crooks who sell cars with known defects and should be jailed.  I will NEVER purchase nor recommend any BMW product.  Also ask about the engine having to be completely torn down and shot sprayed with crushed walnut shells as part of regular maintenance cleaning because it is so poorly designed.   I lost thousands of dollars on this car.  They're cute and fun but don't walk....RUN AWAY FROM THIS LEMON!!!!!!",,

They do NOT fix the problem... only the symptom and know it will happen again and again.

The repairs have involved mechanical and electronic defects. Perhaps this model is defective, but the car is utterly unreliable. And if you don't live near a dealership, forget about this car.

I built and ordered it online, tailor-made for me, after 6 wks, the car was at the dealer as I designed. Cool!

I am writing this review for people who are considering buying this car for frequent long trips. The car is a blast but I'm not sure I would purchase again because of all the long trips I take. In 14 months I have driven this car almost 60k mi. To be honest, the interior is not very comfortable. After driving about 2 hours on the hwy I start to get fidgety. Being in the passenger seat is almost unbearable after 1hr. Great gas mileage, but not really any pickup on the highway. I know I sound like I'm complaining. I really love my Mini but if you plan on driving as much as I do, you might want to reconsider.","I get lots of compliments on my red and black seats, double sunroof, and huge gauges (tho they're not for everyone.)

I have a Porsche Carrera 4 in my garage, and I find myself picking-up the keys to my mini more often than not.  It drives like a dream: It hugs the road like the best, it is roomier than the expensive german brother, and it gives me 35 miles per gallon on the freeway. People complain about a small trunk space: They should buy an SUV.  I play golf often and my clubs fit in the back with the rear sits down. If you want fun, reliable transportation, and great gas mileage: Buy a Mini-cooper S.  If you don't like it, no problem you'll be able to seel it for almost as much as you paid.",,

A other thing is the interior design its so cool its like nothing iv ever seen before. ,they should definitely ad way more power like mady buy 50 so it would be at around 200 that sounds like a good number to me.One other thing they should change is the exterior design to make it appeal to more people.

When I first bought it I loved the way it looks and the tightness of feel it gives when you drive. I now have about 16,000 miles on it, and had no single problem with a car so far. One thing I am very dissatisfied is this car tends to jerk occasionally when you press the gas gently. Seriously. Also even though I've heard model S has so much power and accelerates fast, I absolutely disagree. It really does not accelerate that fast from stop to 60 or accelerating while going. On the freeway, I always have hard time trying to cut other cars off without using sports mode. Even with sports mode, this car just does not accelerate that fast.",Cute exterior and interior design.

It pulls hard from 2500-5000 RPMs, corners like no other, brakes instantly, and looks outstanding (mine's dark grey with a black roof). It's nice to be the envy of everyone on the road, especially others driving a Cooper or Cooper S. In fact, the sense of community with other MINI drivers is one of my favorite aspects of the car.  I was fortunate enough to be in a financial situation where I could afford the JCW, and the slight performance increase (and I mean slight - it's not much) and exclusivity factor made the extra money worth it.  HOWEVER, for anyone more sensible than I, the Cooper S is plenty fun and very much less expensive","The exhaust note is perfect, the exterior is gorgeous, its handling is unparalleled, the acceleration is blindingly quick, and the waves from other MINI owners are awesome, but when I walk outside tired and grumpy every morning and re-realize I commute in this car, my day becomes infinitely better.","Interior is somewhat cheezy, base stereo is underpowered, there are some annoying rattles inside, the sunroof shade doesn't block enough light, and scrolling through artists on the integrated iPod adapter takes WAY too long if you have even a moderate amount of music.

I must say, I was a little concerned about the upcoming Winter, but the Mini was a dream to drive in the snow as well.

Trunk is tiny, but useful w/back seats folded down.","1. ""Sport"" button transforms the ""S"" into a snarly little sports car by tightening shift points & steering. 2.

Stiff ride even without Sport suspension, gets tiresome on the interstate. 3.Some interior controls look & feel cheap. 4.
