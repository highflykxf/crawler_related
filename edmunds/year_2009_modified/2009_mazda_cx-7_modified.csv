Cd player stop working engine eceleration went poor transmission got messed up 8 months later check engine light still on.

3.25,DON'T BUY A MAZDA CX-7,debbiec13 ,03/22/2013,,,4,4,4,1,,1,4,4,4,"Our Mazda CX-7, with 57,000 miles on it, experienced the same sludge build up resulting in a turbo blowing out, timing chain stretching and VVT needing replacement, as thousands of other CX-7 owners have also experienced. With the original warranty and extended warranty still in place, Mazda denied all service claims stating ""poor vehicle maintenance""--as they have with all the other CX-7 owners.In speaking with Mazda technicians, they stated to me that there is a problem with the oil cooled turbo that Mazda refuses to admit to because it will result in a huge recall.Mazda needs to be held accountable for their poor design on these cars and stop putting the blame on consumers.",,
4.875,So far so good,pega ,04/16/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"In 9 months I made put 25K km (17K in miles) and everything is perfect. I've been to a few long trips, it's such a fun to drive this car at these long trips - this is where it's a its best. Gas mileage is a bit on the high side, especially at winter, but hey, you can't have everything. I'm a bit worried reading all the bad reliability reviews for 2007 that I decided to write this one. So far, I love this car.",,
4.125,Engine problems,bmjdlj ,04/15/2010,,,3,5,4,4,,3,5,4,5,"I saw no review about the VVT problem that is part of the CX7.  This can be a very serious problem. To having the entire engine replaced.  Symptoms:  engine makes ticking/clacking noise when running and loud snap upon start up. My first trip to dealership was brushed off. Second trip, doing repairs.","Outside styling. BUT slant of front doors can be a problem.  Top edge of door is back further from handle, has hit me and others in face when closing.",
1.5,Mazda,belajac ,03/08/2010,,,2,2,1,1,,1,2,1,2,Nothing but problems. Two weeks after purchase looked under the car to see what the exhaust looked like the car all I saw was rust from the front to the back I was very disappointed when I buy a new car I expected a new car. Took it in for inspection a few months later and rotors needed cut and brake pads had to have rust sanded ( come on just replace them) then at 6000 miles all my electronics shut down everything went off TCS radio blue tooth navigation gas gauge would float from empty to full I have no idea probably rusted somewhere in the components sound like electrical???? Will they ever figure it out?? I got ride of the car happiest day ever took my loss and bought a Nissan again.,Bose speaker when it worked,Better carpet and the doors are really thin metal.
4.25,No Regrets,torchum ,02/16/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,3,4,The wife purchased this vehicle and although it does not have the bells and whistles of an optioned model (sure wish it had a few more basic ones though) we are very pleased with it. Working with dealership on a few issues but over all very impressed. The 2009 motor vs the 2010 motor is night and day and the main reason for buying an 09,Excellent feel on the road. Drives on rails and has plenty of power for commuting and cruising. Very sharp design inside and out,"Desperately needs more basic options like daytime running lights and headlights that turn off automatically. Heated seats have only one position...on...and this flows up and down with no way to regulate.The WORST is the low beams.Pretty much useless.On a rainy night, they are absolutely UNSAFE. "
4.625,Must test drive,George ,01/17/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,I have owned over 30 cars throughout my life.  This is one of the most fun i have ever had in a car.  Lived in Germany for five years and wished i had the CX-7 for the autobahn.  The seat bottoms in the front seats are a little short.  They may have fixed this for 2010.  ,"Turbo, Turbo, Turbo","Front seats, Stock radio is well below Mazda standards"
4.25,First SUV last Mazda!!!,Siddiqui ,10/16/2009,,,5,5,3,4,,5,4,3,5,"Great combination of sport and utility. Hate to say interior looks nice but cheap quality material, winds noise and side mirror vibrates when drive more than 60 mph, found alot of blind spots. Back lights each set for 569.00 plus tax!!. Too much rounds to gas station after buying it.  Purchased my '09 CX-7 AWD Sport (w/Leather)in July for USD 23000 OTD (out the door) and showed to my cousin and next month he bought 2010 (no leather) but with more nicer interior and options for 21,000 OTD same dealer, which makes me little sad.    Fun to drive but be ready to get TICKET!!.   ",,
5,Love the car so far,vm ,10/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I recently bough the cx7 and am very happy with it.  I really like the steering and the absence of body roll.  The acceleration feels comfortable on the highway, but don't expect this to be a sportscar.  There is plenty of room in the back for groceries or skis (when the seats are laid back). The rear seats are extremely easy to fold back.  I also like the front bucket seats and the leather feels very good.  The interior is way better than a Forrester or an accord.  The few complaints that I have are fuel economy (for me that doesn't matter since I don't drive a lot).  Also the bluetooth is useless.  Also sometimes you can feels bumps on the road.",Handling is great.  Styling and front seats are also way above average.,"Temperature gauge.  New bluetooth system.  Better materials on the interiar roof lining, shifter knob."
4.625,Great CUV For Small Family,Road Trip ,09/02/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Great combination of sport and utility. This is my 2nd CX-7. Purchased my '09 CX-7 AWD Sport(w/Bose and sunroof)in March after completing a short term lease on an '07.  Perfect vehicle for a small family or an adventurous couple.  It's a car(?) I love to drive on a daily basis and it's fantastic for road trips.(I mounted a trailer hitch on mine and we take our bicycles with us on our trips.)  Mileage was quite poor on my '07, but I still bought my '09.  Surprisingly mileage is better on my '09. I get around 18-19mpg in local driving and as much as 24mpg in pure highway driving(w/premium). For a little under 23K this is a CUV that could compete with more more expensive vehicles.","Great handling.  Excellent braking. Bluetooth is awesome. Comfortable driving position.(I'm 6'4""-but nobody wants to sit behind me!!) Great Bose Stereo w/ Satellite Radio. Excellent utility. Security of AWD. Very good safety ratings.",Needs telescoping wheel. Better mileage. Needs outside temperature gauge. More backseat leg room. Better OEM tires. 
4.875,Gotta Love it!,myzoomerama ,08/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love my CX-7!  Traded in a 2004 Mazda 6, wanted to go back to a SUV type vehicle but got the the best of both worlds with my CX-7 - drive's like a sports car with the upgraded comfort and appearance of a small SUV.  Considered just about every SUV on the market including Ford Escape and Nissan Murano.  The CX-7 consistently turns my head and for the price you absolutely can not go wrong!",Sporty yet comfortable feel.,"DTE, Avg. Mileage, MPG gauges would be nice.  Not having them makes me wonder if Mazda is trying to hide something (my 6 didn't have them either)"
4.75,LOVE this car!,Shawn ,08/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I have been a loyal Honda customer for 6 years and had the intention of purchasing a Honda CR-V.  The Mazda CX-7 is so much fun to drive, has more room than the CR-V, and is very sleek. The handling is awesome and is just a fantastic car for our growing family, including pets. LOVE this car!  When push came to shove, Honda wouldn't come close on the price OR the financing. I think I have been converted to a Mazda driver and may not ever go back to Honda. Everyone who has ridden in this car says it rides like a feather, especially in the back seat. It has a huge space in the rear and is just an all-around great car that is so much fun to drive!  The Mazda CX-7 is my new favorite car!","Fun to drive (Zoom Zoom!) Sleek interior, lots of room all-around (front, back, back storage) Love the look and the feel of driving this car. It gets better than the mileage advertised. We travel quite a bit and are getting about 25/26 miles to a gallon, which is great...comparable to the CR-V. ","The head rests are a bit ""hard"" and have little cushion. Otherwise, an amazing car that doesn't need much improvement! A great car that is cheaper than the CR-V and is more fun to drive too! Many have mistaken our white CX-7 for a Lexus SUV because they look so similar. "
4.5,So Far So Good,The Binnie ,06/18/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,3,5,No real problems yet. Only have 900 miles on it,The Bose system is great unbelievable sound.,The tubro lag and gas mileage
4.75,Mazda 2009 Sport,Rick ,05/03/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Only have about 1500 miles on it.  Broken in very easily and averaged 23.3 MPG mostly around town.  Quality is excellent.  I bought the least expensive Sport version, no bells and whistles to speak of.  Had the dealer install a Sunroof and it works better than the factory.  My suggestion, spend the extra money and get more extras.  I drive a lot, 35K yearly, and probably made a mistake with the MPG but I knew what it was when I bought it.  It is a blast to drive and has great acceleration around town.  Zippy!  Vehicle is tight with no squeaks or rattles and nothing has fallen off yet so things are good.  I would recommend this vehicle.","Acceleration and quality of construction for a $23K car, not bad. I think the car looks good too and it has a sporty feel when driving.  Quite impressed.  We aren't talking a BMW here, just a solid, quick steering, inexpensive vehicle.","This car needs day-time driving lights, automatic door locks (the ones that lock your car as you are driving away) and at least an outside Temp gauge.  Common now!"
4.125,fun to drive but window worries,sue sellman ,04/27/2009,,,4,5,4,3,,5,4,3,5,"I researched this car for weeks before making my purchase (lease) in January of09. The car is so much fun to drive and is really a good looking vehicle- I have black on black. I have been having weird problems with the car, though. At first I thought it was driver error, but no. Occasionally when I would return to my locked vehicle I noticed the windows were half way down on the front, and the moon roof was partially opened. Once in a while after turning the key off the driver seat would automatically go back. Well, the window thing kept occurring so I took it to the deal and they replaced the main ""brain modular"". Now it is happening AGAIN!! Unsure on the quality of this vehicle!","I love the engine, the stereo bose sytem rocks and the car is sleek!",Gas mileage is really no surprise but could stand some improvements.
3.75,2009 GT with Techno Pkg,ultimate_meenie ,04/11/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,3,3,4,"Having a fun car to drive is a top priority for me, at the same time I like something practical; cx7 fits the bill perfectly.  The power is good and the handling is excellent.  It looks, feels and drives sporty.  The tech package is great, lots of nice features for the money.  My biggest disappointments so far have been the excessive road noise and lack luster Bose stereo.  In terms of gas mileage; Mostly city-18MPG and mostly highway- 22MPG.  In my shopping I think Rav4 \Forester are the best all around choices; Santa Fe, most refinement and bang for the buck, CX-7, best sporty crossover; poor mans FX35-X3-RDX.","Good power, excellent handling. Keyless entry/ignition. Xenon lights.  Sporty interior layout, Blue on red interior light scheme.  Stand out styling.  Car for the money.","Too much wind and tire noise.  Improve exhaust note.  Bose stereo needs an upgrade.  More cubbies (pockets on the rear doors, grocery bag hooks in the cargo area, storage bin on top of ash).  Better gas mileage."
4.875,Wonderful Car,Bob Atkinson ,03/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"One of the best cars I have ever driven, a Joy!!! My only gripe is the Navigation needs upgrading, but its still very good.",Everything,"Navigation, better gas mileage, would be nice if there was a hybrid."
3.75,"2009 CX-7, 2-WD",Zoomin 09 ,01/31/2009,,,3,4,4,4,,4,3,4,4,Traded in a 2007 Mazdaspeed6 Grand Touring which I was leasing for an 09 CX-7 Sport. Purchased on a budget and certainly miss all the bells and whistles. However this is a fun car to drive considering what it is. Exterior styling is awesome but the interior is bland. There is considerable torque steer under moderate acceleration. After driving for a few days I wish I had spent the cash and upgraded to the Touring model. ,Exterior styling. Room to haul stuff and still look cool.,Telescopic steering column should be standard. I have to sit too close to the pedals to reach the wheel comfortably.
4.375,So Far So Good,desertrat ,01/20/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,3,5,"After recently owning both Lexus and BMW, I decided to try a Mazda this time. Considering I had a questionable repair history with the fancy nameplates, what's the worst that could happen with Mazda? Well after 1800 miles, nothing. The vehicle is fun to drive, handles well and looks great. Only time will tell of course, but so far I have been impressed with the car.","Great acceleration and great looking. Handles well,  Bose system and Bluetooth are flawless. Comfortable seats.",Need outside temp gauge and power passenger seat. Don't care for red dash lighting.
5,Outstanding performance,RaceCarDriver1 ,12/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just bought this CX-7 this month. I am very excited about this SUV. Drives and handles great. Has a turbo 4 cylinder that feels like a V-8. Awesome power, especially when you need that extra boost to get on the freeway, or just changing lanes. The interior feels like a glove. Fully loaded was the way it came. Even have seat warmers and power seats. Has excellent sound system stock with mp3 and media connections. I Drove all the competions SUV's that were in it's class, however, this was the best by far for money, performance and style and comfort. Excellent SUV. I am very happy and I got a great deal below invoice!",Interior and the performance. For an SUV it gets excellent gas milege. I average 25-28 mpg so far. Depends on how often I drive in town. Just a great SUV with power everything. ,More colors and brighter colors.
4.75,My first Mazda,hmason ,12/02/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Picked up my Grand Touring CX7 three weeks ago. Drives great, performance is very good. The interior could use upgrade, the door panels look cheap. Overall the CX7 is worth the money and is fun to drive.","Performance from the turbo, no turbo lag that I can feel","Improve access programing to the nav system, upgrade the door panels, "
4.125,Do not buy CX-7 AWD ,Maavalous ,11/25/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,3,3,5,"Do not buy a Mazda CX-7 with AWD! Mazda has a serious vibration issue in all the Cx-7 AWD models.  From 55 to 100 mph (yes, I tested to 100) the car has a vibration in the AWD system.  I tried to get it repaired and they tried for a while and gave up.  We found four examples and they all vibrated.  They now consider the vibration ""normal"".  They refused to replace mine because ""it would not eliminate the problem"".  I tested almost all the CUVs out there... none vibrate like this! Beware!  They are not going to fix this!!","Stereo, navigation, looks, handling, performance.  If you don't get AWD, the car rocks!",Interior plushness on Grand Touring.  Better front seats. Lots of little stuff that is OK but could be better.  But the big one is the AWD vibration problem.
4.875,"Wonderful Car, Navigation Is Bad",AgentBob ,10/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought my 2009 CX-7 Grand Touring FWD in Oct 2008, wonderful car so far, great style. The only thing it needs is a complete overhaul on the navigation system-very hard to read. Aside from that I would buy another. I only have 325 miles on it so far, but I was happy with the lease terms. Go and buy this and have fun.","Exterior styling, ample room.","Navigation system is the worst I have seen. Also would be nice if they had a feature that tells you what your MPG is. Blue Tooth is okay, but you cannot program any numbers with the Nav screen, everything through the voice comm. Also needs a button inside to unlock trunk. "
