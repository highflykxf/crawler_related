4,7yr review,Byron Wilsom ,10/29/2016,4,3,3,,,5,4,3,3,,,"I have 57000 miles on the exl pilot.This SUV is the smoothest running vehicle I've ever owned.I use it as a work car mostly.It has 4wheel drive.I really wish we would get a lot of snow so I can see how well this works.The amount of snow in central Ohio is very limited.I bought the extended warranty at the dealer and wouldn't do it again.I replaced the battery and replaced the heating element in both front seats.I paid $1300 for extended warranty and have not broke even yet.I have heard these pilots can easily reach 200,000 miles.If you don't drive a lot of miles I wouldn't purchase it.The pilot has the 3 set of airbags on driver and passenger side.It will seat 8 and both seats in back will fold flat on the floor.I would buy this vehicle again.No remorse.",,

4,Great reliable vehicle but poor gas milege and acc,Mike jones ,07/09/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,3,5,,,"I read some of the bad reviews but I guess I ended up with a good one. So far I have 108k miles and never had any problems. Just regular oil change and That's it. There was a recall on the front suspension making noise. Just gotta take it in to the dealer to get it fixed for free. Its roomy and it's a great family car, has enough space for all your stuff for long road trips. But, lol Yea there's always something. Its a great family vehicle but when u are driving by yourself and u wanna have some fun, nope. The acceleration is horrible esp if your trying to merge on to free way. Handeling is less than sub par. Bottom line: great family vehicle, but very boring car. Gas mileage could improve.",,

4,"""It's suppose to burn that much oil!""",Cheeky ,03/22/2016,3,,4,,,4,,4,5,,,"Well, I have had my pilot since 09. I have enjoyed it so far, with a few exceptions. Around 80,000 miles my engine started misfiring. And I got a check engine light that came on. I took it to autozone were they pulled a code. The code confirmed my thoughts, it was a missfire in two of my spark plugs. I decided to save a little money and replace them myself. Figured how much trouble could it be. I pulled the plugs and two of the plugs seem to have been worn excessively.I started to do some research online only to find out that a lawsuit against Honda about this problem. Apparently the piston rings would shift and allow oil to enter the piston chamber, causing pre mature wear on the plugs and excessive oil consumption. Honda knows of the problem and is supposed to fix it. I brought this to the attention of dealership I frequently visit. I was told because I replaced the plugs and code was cleared I just had to wait until it happens again.Since that incident both catalic converters have failed, why you ask well because they have been coated with oil. By the way that will be a $1400 job please. Also, my Honda pilot if it sits running while parked for over a minute , and then I press the accelerator it blows out a large amount of smoke. I have since brought that up to the dealership.  The mechanic told me I needed a new engine! Well, I brought up the leaking piston rings, the lawsuit etc. I was then told "" That now I need to do an oil consumption test"". Apparently burning three quarts of oil between oil changes is ""normal"" according to Gunn Honda. I haven't changed the catalic converters on my pilot yet because I figured it would be a waste of money if they are going to get covered with oil and go out again ;I may want to wait. By not changing them keeps my fuel management system from working properly. For those who need further explanation if you see the green ""ECO"" light on! You are running on three cylinders and not six, which is ""supposed"" to be increasing your gas mileage.So if you are thinking of buying a used one understand this might be what you are getting.I will say other than that problem I have really enjoyed the ride and  comfort of the pilot. If the new ones didn't look like the Honda Odyssey so much I might have upgraded.",,

2.75,2009 Honda Pilot Review,captainbull ,06/22/2015,,,1,2,2,4,,3,4,3,3,"We bought our 2009 Honda Pilot as new from a Honda dealership here are our assessments:

1. Cheap interior design.  Cheap plastic and adhesive.  The ""skin"" for the club compartment peels off easy.
2. Cheap glasses.  Just one little hit of a little rock the windshield just cracked.  It's so thin.
3. Noisy driving (windows not tight seal).
4. Cheap paint (scratch easy)
5. Incorrect gas mileage (they lied) we only get 18MPG on HW and 16MPG city.
6. Stupid trailer light system design.  They just want their dealers to make extra cash (so many steps to install it) and the kit cost over $200!)
7. Only one key entry from driver side.
8. Windshield wiper fluid pump failed to early.
","1. Roomy.
2. Engine is dependable.","My feedbacks are for our 2009 Honda Pilot, but they are the same for all later models.  Fix all the problems in the review above.  Next vehicle will be a Toyota that what's we should have stayed with."

4,No Honda Reliability,vq35de1 ,09/30/2014,5,3,5,,,4,5,3,5,,,"This car has a lot going for it, it's comfortable, has tons of interior storage, seats eight comfortably, etc....  BUT, we have had a lack of reliability including a transmission sensor and now the engine.  Look into the Honda VCM V6 problems.  The cylinder shut off system ends of fouling the plugs leading to a million warning lights and a trip to the dealer.  The ""fix"" is to replace your plugs or short block depending on how bad things got.  There doesn't seem to be a fix, just a band-aid.  Now I'm going to have to trade her in way before I planned because once the extended warranty is up I don't want to pay the maintenance.Update 9/30/2016. I kept the car and the problem has not come back.  I think this is only because the car is never in eco mode for long.  If you drive a lot of hwy miles you may have more problems.",,

Saw the oil was low. topped it off and then checked periodically. We have 25K miles on it now and used synthetic oil. It appears I am not the only one complaining or noticing the low oil level. check out carcomplaints.com. Going to see what the dealer has to say and have it documented.

I did notice at about 15,000 miles before an oil change it was low on oil, not low enough for the light to come on though. I been monitoring the oil level since then wondering if it was dripping for the filter or the oil plug, but nothing.  Now with 24,000+ miles I still notice I need to add a quart of oil in between oil changes. Started looking on-line to see if anyone else is starting to notice the same as myself, YES they r. Check your oil level in between changes to see if your vehicle is also consuming oil too. I had been using synthetic oil at every oil change. I'm curious if other owners are noticing the consumption.

2.75,Reliability of Honda now in question,jimbob ,08/19/2010,,,4,3,1,1,,3,4,3,3,"I have owned this Pilot since Sep of '09 and initially enjoyed the vehicle with the exception of the hands-free phone operation.  I did experience a reliability/quality problem with this SUV when my independent mechanic noticed some leak in the ""lower control arm bushings"" so he recommended that I take it to a dealer to see if it would be covered.  Since I had exceeded the 36k warranty, Honda said it would cost me $1100 to repair this problem and they would not cover any of the costs.  It was obvious to me that this was not a simple ""wear and tear"" type of problem and more likely a defect that did not show itself in the first 36k miles.  In any case, Honda was not willing to do anything.",I like the GPS/Navigation display and the fact that I could enter addresses even when the vehicle was moving (unlike my Toyota/Lexus vehicles).

Averages 18.6 per gallon. 3rd row seat actually usable as opposed to our '08 Pilot. They stretched this wheelbase about 3 inches and it made a difference in 2nd/3rd row legroom (especially 2nd row) and in ride quality. Ride is firm to sporty but definitely not carlike (like Highlander). Auto (5 speed) transmission shifts seemlessly and goes in and out of cylinder deactivation without any noticeable difference in performance. Cabin seems quiet (for a Honda) and the 4wd is awesome in the rain. Massive amount of cargo space with 3rd row seat stowed away. Front seat ergonomics good with leather.,Rear Hatch opens easily; rear hatch has glass which opens independently of hatch and is useful when you don't want to open full hatch.

Our last Honda (88 Accord) had 250K miles when we sold it and was still going strong.   We have taken this vehicle on several trips, including one to the mountains, and have averaged 20.5 MPG overall in 7700 miles, and have seen 25 MPG on short trips.  The wife loves all of the places to store stuff.  I wish the tires were quieter, and the RES allowed for the kids to listen to a different radio station than the driver.  The hard plastics inside scratch much too easily, and the passenger seat doesn't have enough thigh support.  Rear camera should show up on display instead of mirror.  Need better cushioning under cargo area carpet.","Ride, convenience, Satellite radio, storage, 110v outlet in center console.","Premium Radio is weak on features and sound.

First of all this is our 5th Honda in 10 years and have never had an issue out of some small recalls. This new pilot drives and is more comfortable than our 04. For an LX model it comes loaded with features. The power is OK but my wife drives it mainly so she thinks it's good enough. The seats are more supportive and comfortable. The steering is tighter without that small dead spot that the 04 seemed to have.",Tow package standard. Ride. Quality. Reliability. The chiseled looks.,Wiring Harness!

I traded a Landcruiser because I was looking for something with better gas mileage, and economy. I love my Pilot. Once you are in the car, you forget about the boxy style. I am getting twice the gas mileage as in my previous car. It is a safe, fun , reliable car to drive. I bought the 4wd for traveling off road later. I plan to keep my Pilot for many years.

A bit low but this is a big box! Suspension is a bit too stiff and with a truck type tire and stiffer steering than our previous two vehicles ('07 Pacifica & '02 Highlander) you never feel like you're 'part of the vehicle'. Bucket seats are firm but comfortable. Plenty of cubby holes and storage compartments but interior trim materials are hard to the touch and unattractive. Sound system is just 'OK'. '02 Highlander sound system has better features. Glad we leased. Engine Mgmt. system works well. No discernible sensation when system shuts down or turns on cylinders.     ,Storage space.

I did take it out of cruise when climbing long grades the transmission shifts too much if left in cruise....I was driving 12 hour days and did not get tired at all the Pilot is very comfortable....even around town I get little better than 15 mpg. It does drift to the right if you take your hands off the wheel. But most 4WD's I have driven do the same thing. I'm very happy with my Pilot.","I do like the mpg feature on the odometer, the rear A/C outlets are a nice feature also.","Better visibility on the sides too many blind spots.

Bought the Pilot in September of 2008, and have been very happy so far with no problems.  Towed a tent camper trailer without any problems  -- hardly knew the trailer was behind us -- did not have any issues with sway.",Very smooth driving with good visibility over the hood.  Enjoy the hands-free bluetooth feature -- the clarity on phone calls is superb.  Also enjoy the dual front zone climate control.  Love the dash-mounted shifter which frees up storage room between the front seats.,"Road noise level is above average.  The voice recognition system can be frustrating at times.

Sure there are other SUV that are better in some areas but the Pilot got our vote because overall it had the most for the money.  It stops very fast if you are driving at high speed.  It rides smooth compare to others.  It is roomier than others and it carries a lot more than what the brochure says, trust me we have tried.  Fuel consumption is better than what the brochure says.  It does get 25mpg on the highway and fully loaded with 5 people it still gets 24mpg.  We just love it.",3rd row seat has a lots of room.

Although the Highlander has better looks, pickup and performance, the steering response was non-existent, it was like playing a video game. Also, the space after the last row on the Highlander was minimal, and the last row did not have a split seat.  Pilot on the other hand did not have great pickup, but once you get to the highway speeds, it performed remarkably well.  The ride quality and steering response were excellent.  The utility factor is awesome, with 110v outlet, ipod link etc.  Also, I sat much more comfortably and had a better view of the road than the Highlander.  Overall a great family SUV.","The ride quality, rear camera, Rear Entertainment System, steering response, climatic control and the Eco Drive feature, where the Pilot can run on a lower number of cylinders when all 6 are not required.  The enhanced frame containing lot more steel to improve safety.","Improve Gas Mileage and add a few more Horse Power.  I get about 19MPG in city, and 22 on Highway.

We're hooked on the XM radio, love the dual zone climate controls and are very impressed with the overall room of the interior.  We were looking forward to having the class 3 trailer hitch, but were sorely disappointed with the fact that just the Honda trailer wire harness is $181 dollars for a 2 foot harness under the bumper(?!). Even more disappointed that the connector under the bumper is a goofy connector that NOBODY carries yet.  Happy over all though.  We'll just wait to buy a harness from someone not trying to rip off a customer for an overpriced set of wires. Happy with the handling, but our Pilot pulls to the right on level ground at constant speed",Love the XM radio and sound system. Interior space with the rear seats folded down is great.  Love the dual zone climate controls in the front and the separate climate control for the rear passengers.,"Extend that trailer harness under the bumper another 2 feet so it reaches the hitch mount. $180 bucks for a 2 foot wiring harness?

The Pilot does double duty as a business vehicle that regularly tows a 5,000 pound utility trailer and a weekend family cruiser. Very impressed with how well it does both, and I'm very surprised to see the engine occasionally described as underpowered as I've experience nothing of the kind and am very impressed with both the towing ability and quickness from a stop, as well as the highway climbing torque.

Definitely the best SUV for a family, because you can fit 3 people in both the middle and back rows.  The reason we bought this vehicle is because we have two kids in car seats and my wife wanted to be able to sit in the back with them. This is the only SUV we could find that has the LATCH system in the middle seat.  So we can put the two car seats together, and my wife can sit on the end.  The reason this is handy is so that if others needed to access the third row, you wouldn't have to remove a car seat.  That would be a pain!  The third row seat is also actually quite spacious for adults. Great family car.  The only thing is that it's kinda boring to drive. ","The best thing about this car is that you can put child car seats in all three seats in the middle row, AND also one in back.  Great for kids.  Also love that you can fit 8 people.  It's nice that it has 4 wheel drive.  It's basically as handy as a minivan but the 4 wheel drive puts it over the top.",The performance is sluggish.  Engine needs more power.

Some say the road noise is a problem, but we did not find it to be that bad.

The Pilot has more than exceeded our expectations and, at this point, is the most enjoyable vehicle we have ever owned. Increased gas mileage over the Ranier is also a plus. The Pilot has the best-designed and most usable, roomy interior we have ever seen. Combine that with a striking exterior and fun-to-drive performance, then wrap it up in Honda dependability and you have a package that is hard to beat. Did I mention that the Pilot was $6000 less than the Enclave?

Our main concern was a safe and comfortable vehicle to travel long distances and that got reasonable gas mileage for an SUV.  The touring model ended up being our pick due to the Michelin tires.  The sales people we encountered at all of the dealerships were not knowledgeable about the fact that there is a difference in the tires on the Touring and the EX and LX models.  The Michelin tire on the Touring gave us a much quieter ride.","Love the navigation system which we didn't think we'd use.

Plenty of features- Honda put a lot of thought in this vehicle-mirror for viewing the backseats, MP3 jack, console with lots of room. Plenty of storage in the doors.

1.875,Not too proud of honda,nunchuck ,04/26/2009,,,1,2,1,1,,2,3,3,2,After purchasing a 2009 Honda ex-l pilot  I realize that the pre-wiring connection was a dummy connection. I am not able to connect a trailer wiring harness unless I purchase the expensive kit from Honda. The kit cost more than if I had bought the tow hitch separate and had it wired. I also found out splicing into the wiring voids the warranty. Then I learned that remote start is a problem. Turning the car off after remote start just to enter the car is the dumbest idea I ever heard. It is my understanding both of these feature was pre-figure to get you to come back to Honda. I just wonder what else have Honda done to steer you back to them. My first Honda and my last. Bad mistake of Honda.,I have no favorite features on this vehicle. Just realize I could have gotten more for my money if I had stuck with American made vehicle.,Not manipulating their customer and steering them back to Honda to make a dollar.

I had no complaints about my CRV other than I wanted that ""luxury"" feel and needed more room.  I drove many vehicles in my search and decided on the Pilot because it drove the best and gave me exactly what I wanted for a lot less than the Acura MDX and I liked the interior better than the Highlander. The pilot is a dream to drive and although it won't win any races, it has plenty of power.  Love at first drive for me.  :) My gas mileage is in line with what others seem to be getting.  In mixed driving, around 18 mpg. ","Love the ""tech"" features.  Nav/memory seats/sound system/dvd surround. The integrated Ipod is a nice feature. You can control your Ipod via the nav screen. The only downside is, if you have a lot of music, it takes a LONG time to navigate thru the list. ","I do agree the glove box is very small.

Allows more room between the seats for storage,Would like to see the reset button for the trip meters on the steering wheel or on the inst. panel.

4.75,Another Pilot for us,AJ ,02/27/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Originally hated the new styling, hoped for more rounder then boxy.  Now that I own one, I like the shape, it grew on me.  We are very happy with this vehicle.  Coming from an 04 Pilot there are many changes, more space, bigger feel, smoother drive, better interior.  Plastic dash doesn't bother me, controls are easy to learn.  I do find myself sitting forward when driving, it's not the headrest but the support behind my back pushing me forward.  Seats are very comfortable.  Pick-up can be a bit sluggish when merging onto the highway.  Love the radio and the way it displays station, song title and artist. Much better access to the handle for lowering the third row then in the 2004. ","Radio displays, you always know what song and who's singing.  XM radio, MP3 outlet.  Space and lots of it.  Comfortable seats.  Ease of lowering the third row, no more headrests to take off and on and handles are lower and easier to use.  Dual climate.  Drives great, handles well, we love this SUV.","Plastic on inside, near door handles, scratches very easily.  Braking is fine but acceleration can be sluggish when merging on highway.  Window rattles when partly open. Gas mileage is respectable for size, we average about 17 around town, I try not to be heavy on the gas pedal."

I wish that there was more room behind the third row seat.  There really isn't much.  The stereo, XM radio and DVD player are great.  I enjoy driving this vehicle.  I have had no issues with the cruise control or acceleration speeds.  I'm not a big fan of the middle console between the front two seats.  It's a weird size and junk gets lost in it.  The glove box is pretty much worthless.","I like the way the Pilot looks and how it drives.  I love the stereo, XM radio and DVD player.  It's a really cool vehicle to own and drive.",More room behind 3rd row seat is a must.  Do something different with the middle console.  Make the glove box bigger.

Ride is comfortable and the integrated MP3 for my iPod is incredible.  The navigation system is average.,"MP3 integration, AWD, XM/Sirius satellite, good handling.","Gas mileage is marginal.  Could probably done as well with a larger Toyota Seq.  I primarily drive in the city, but average about 13 MPG (when I drive strictly on the highway, it's around 19 MPG)."

4.625,2009 Pilot has the right combination,NMH ,02/13/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I purchased a ""plain Jane"" LX FWD version in fall of 2008 because it beat the nearest competition (GMC Arcadia) on interior features, width of roominess and price ($4500 cheaper on base model after all the rebates and negotiation at actual dealers).  After 1 year of internet search, two car shows with a measuring tape in hand, I test drove both the Pilot and Arcadia back to back on the same piece of city/highway road on the same day.  Pilot has great sound, is smooth and quiet and had the exact room I needed - I wanted to be able to have two 36 in long dog crates kept regularly in the back of the SUV with the 3rd seat down and still be able to have the 2nd row seats up for passengers. ",Interior width of Pilot is slightly more than Arcadia/Outlook/Englave but slightly shorter bed- tradeoff.  Really impressed with the interior on the base model.  City highway MPG combined is about 19/20 is very good for the size of the vehicle. ,"For a 5'2"" woman, the driver's side is obviously designed for a taller person to enter it.  Base model desperately needs a simple running board. Would suggest an armrest than drops down as most folks are not as wide as the Pilot seats so its hard for an average person to rest their elbows."

We definitely made the right decision!  We've only had the car for about a week. Others have complained about the lack of pick up but we don't have any complaints.  We love the interior.  Although it feels so roomy, it is much easier to park and maneuver then it looks.   I do agree with the others who stated that some of the interior components seem a little cheap.   Also, I've never had a rear wiper before and I've gotten OCD about keeping the darn thing clean.  Are they always so prone to dirt?  I seem to be spraying and wiping constantly.","The rear hidden cargo space, roomy third seat and the ease of accessing the third seat, XM radio, comfortable seats for both passenger and driver, ","The volume control button and the tuner button are identical on the radio, make the tuner button a big button for ease of use and to differentiate between the two.

This car is very roomy.  The seating arrangements are very flexible for the 2nd & 3rd rows.  Engine is very quiet and smooth but there is some road noise.  The EX does not have leather seats but the fabric is VERY nice.  Hard to describe but kind of a hi-tech feel.  The seats are very comfortable with plenty of adjustments.  At first I thought the front interior looked kind of plasticy (if that's a word) but it's because there's so much room in front.  It really looks fine and the fit and finish is very solid.  Gas mileage is only 14.5 in city driving so far.,"Basic stereo has nice sound, steering wheel audio & XM.  Homelink.  Maintenance indicator. Flip glass in rear.  LOTS of cargo space & flexibility.  Smooth ride.  Hopefully will have Honda reliability. This car is very roomy inside.",MPG. I'm a conservative driver so I'm hoping as the car breaks in will get a little better.

My wife has the 03 CRV and that has been a workhorse and we love it.  We are hoping that this Pilot will do the same for us.  We are enjoying it so far.  We had a snow storm and it drove like a tank as it plowed through ice and snow.  We were looking at the 4runner and we found that the Pilot drove much better - the drive feels more comfortable, yet firm and responsive to drive, it also feels much more powerful - even with the V8 version of the 4runner.  Finally you get more for your money with the Pilot. ","Quiet ride, rear entertainment DVD player, GPS, USB, automatic gate, roomy third row seat, ample storage, Bluetooth, steering wheel controls, voice activated controls - you can operate the vehicle without practically taking your hands off the wheel, other than shifting gears.","Although the vehicle has 12 cup holders, there are only 2 upfront, an extra cup holder would be nice.

Priced the same vehicle for another 3 year lease and would have to take an additional $100/month out of my pocket for 39 months.  Once I test drove the Pilot, I fell in love.  I will say that it is not nearly as fun to drive but functionality and space overcome the need for speed.  Comfort matches if not beats the 09 MDX I tested.  I also tested the GM equivalents including the overpriced fully-loaded Enclave.

I researched the vehicles on line and then went to a few dealerships, stopping at a Honda dealer last to check out the CRV. On the floor was the Pilot, it had the room I wanted and a nav unit which I felt was a must, one test ride and I was hooked.

I looked at everything in this category including Highlander, Veracruz, CX-9, Traverse, Arcadia and the Acura MDX.  Hands down, the Pilot trounces them all in features, technology and value.  This vehicle has better tech than even the more expensive Acura MDX (USB audio interface for iPod).  If you are looking at a mid/full size SUV - you must consider the Pilot.

This vehicle replaces a 2002 CRV, so it's obvious an upgrade.   Feature-wise, we're quiet happy with it. We looked seriously at Saturn Outlook, 2006 Pilot, and Toyota Highlander.  Outlook, from a driver's view, just didn't feel right.   Highlander felt pretty decent, but didn't care for fit for passengers in 3rd row.  2006 Pilot felt great from a driving standpoint, but felt like it had less leg room in 2nd row than our CRV. After two test drives on the 09 Pilot and there was little doubt.  This was a smart pick. ","Separate heat/cooling for driver, passenger, back area heated seats driver fit (seat, steering wheel). XM radio 3rd seat (splits). Safety features ","Get rid of foot emergency brake (left foot needs more room for rest - use hand brake (like 2002 - 2006 CRV)). Change front belt buckle grille.

Immediately we had to have it.  Don't know what the fuss is with the styling, we like it from every angle.  We have the Mocha Metallic ext. with beige leather and think it is a very classy combination.  I love the drivetrain.  With concentration I can feel the VCM but it is very imperceptible.  Ride is very smooth without being floaty.  Handles great.  Very solid feeling, doors slam shut like a Mercedes.  Awesome seats and features for the money.  Would not mind another couple mpg but easy on gas for a lg. vehicle.  Love the dual exhaust looks and sound.  ","Power and handling very good for such a large vehicle.  Very big and usable interior.

The battery has died twice while parked with everything off. This happened at approx 3200 miles and just this week with 5000 miles. The side trim panel on the drivers side door next to the window fell off. The entire vehicle rattles and squeaks as if there were 105,000 miles on it (Our 02 SAAB & 03 VW are quiet!)

I noticed that the steering would pull to the right. I was told it was the crown in the road. Having insisted on something being done, a number of adjustments were made and it drives better. The next issue which has me pondering trading the car in,is noise heard from the gas tank. When the gas tank is full, I can hear the gas sloshing around and it makes a loud thumping noise. The dealership stated this was due to the design of the gas tank and a condition of the car. Take the opportunity to turn off your radio and drive around.

Nimbleness - it has decent turn radius and good handling on the road, but is really over sized in parking, both getting into spaces and opening doors when parked. Stupid remote locking system - must unlock again to open hatch and can't click to lock if any door open. Maybe configurable, but haven't figured out. Finally, watch out for Honda Leasing.  Closed with $0.15 per excess mile on 3 year, then called back in to sign new contract at $0.20. Wouldn't have leased at that rate.",Comfortable.  Drives smoothly.

Many object to the looks of the Pilot - we like it lot; looks like a real SUV.  This vehicle is the clear choice for those looking for the utmost utility, safety, modern conveniences, and medium- duty off-road capability (yes, that is what the Pilot's chassis, unibody structural integrity, and suspension are designed for), reasonable fuel efficiency, and highly functional (hopefully reliable) 4WD system.  Pilot=best value/content going for the $$$ - mighty beefy S/CUV!",Best off-road capabilities of any CUV (true medium duty); nice ride and good handling on road; cylinder management for fuel conservation; all the tech goodies that came in my Touring trim; great looking interior (mine is black leather int./black exterior) and comfortable front seats; storage/cargo,"Only had it for 4 days; I truly can find no faults for my money and tastes.

What surprised me was how solid, and capable it feel's driving on rutted out, washboard dirt roads-a big plus for an avid kayaker/mtn. biker/all around outdoor enthusiast in western Montana. On road handling was good enough, but much improved with a set of aftermarket 18 in wheels and upgraded tires, and still rides smooth on and off road! Factory side steps and rack help break up a somewhat frumpy design, and along with the aftermarket wheels gives the pilot a much sportier demeanor. I'm really impressed with the quality, technology, and overall driving dynamic's.","I love the vtm-4 lock for the all wheel drive. Nice stereo, and high tech, yet user friendly dash design. Cavernous space with seats folded flat for all my outdoor gear. Friend's love second row seating space and comfort. Three zone climate control works well.

In comparison, the '09 has a much smoother & more quiet ride. Road noise has been reduced dramatically. There are more standard options and features on the new model. I am having to get use to the VCM technology. There is noticeable hesitation when the vehicle changes cylinder rotation. Some reviews have given the Pilot bad marks on the lack of V6 power.

Mileage is as advertised, although the mileage readout feature on dash can teach you to be light-footed and bump the mileage up some (AWD gets close to 16 in stop and go commute and close to 23 mpg on I-95 with its occasional slowdowns).

At first, I thought it was the road, but the pull was consistent on all road surfaces. After calling the dealer, I discovered that Honda did not redesign the springs for the all-new 2009 Pilot, and as a result, the alignment problems are becoming prevalent. Here's the problem: the 2009 models have more weight distribution in the front compared to 2008 models, and heavier springs should have been used. The dealer indicated they needed Honda approval to fix the problem. The fix consists of replacing the right front spring with a rear spring from a 2009 4WD model.

For the long trip I found the space above the glove box helpful for gum, change, etc. Our teens love the wireless headsets - and the ability for us to hear XM - while they watched their DVD.  The road handling was excellent- especially in a horrible rain storm. The rear wiper - starts out fast then goes into it's slow mode-very helpful. All in all -a very satisfied customer. As an ex-suburban owner- goodbye GM.","Navigation, many variations to fold seats, rear door opener, rear camera, Hands free link - no more onstar costs. Road handling.  remote in key.

A like equipped Highlander was several thousand dollars more.  After a month with the new Pilot we are very satisfied.  Comfortable ride, good performance and improved gas mileage (from the previous year).  Honda quality is readily apparent everywhere in the vehicle.  A great choice",Rear view camera on the mirror keeps your eyes where they belong. Hidden storage in the back. Ipod is kept out of sight.

5,Love my New Pilot,Loving Honda ,07/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have been shopping for a new SUV for 6 months. Almost bought the Toyota 4Runner but decided on Honda Pilot because of 3rd row fold down seat. I love that it does not look like a crossover.  The only negative is the 2nd row seats only recline a little.  We are a family of 4 coming out of an Odyssey and we loved to be able to recline the 2nd row on long trips. I also like the door cup holders on our 07 CR-V and the 09 Pilot only has them for the 2nd row. There are 2 cup holders in the center console. I love the high tech & luxurious feel of the cockpit. The drivers seat feels very cushy and I love the lumbar support. My kids love the pop out remote control for the DVD. Averaging 17mpg city.  ,All the compartments for storage. Actual mpg indicator. Comfort. Luxurious feel. Got $2300 off through Costco buying process,Be able to recline 2nd row seat further.

3.75,2 car seats and an adult in the 2nd row!,Joe ,07/28/2008,,,5,4,3,5,,3,4,3,3,"With a growing family we were in the market for a large crossover.  Viewed all the typical competitors and the Honda was honestly last on our list.  The deciding factor?  We had one requirement that eliminated all of the other crossovers.  We wanted to fit a rear facing infant seat, another car seat and an adult in the second row.  The Honda was the only car that did it safely and comfortable.  We are amazed that so few cars can do that other than the GMC Yukon which is much too large for city driving.  So far the ride is fine.  Fit and finish leave much to be desired.  Already have one panel that doesn't fit right but I hope Honda can fix it.",Second row space is great. Good choice if you don't want to banish people to the third row. Enough space behind the third row for baby equipment.  Compliant drive.  easy to drive on crowded Chicago streets.  Loaded with features. Love the DVD player !,"Fit and finish could be better.  After buying German for so many years we are not so used to all the plastic but hey, it costs less than some key competitors. GMC Acadia has as much plastic and at least Honda pulls it off better. Guess they are used to it."

5,Excellent Choice,travelgirl ,07/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We looked at every Mid-size SUV on the market and the 2009 Honda Pilot was at the bottom of our list.  My husband test drove it first and said I should really check this car out and I am so glad I did.  It is beautiful inside and out, fun to drive, easy to park, great stereo, kids love it, and it has every bell and whistle you can think of.  I am extremely pleased with the new Pilot.  Who needs a mini van when there is an SUV like this on the market?","Interior styling, stereo system, lots of room, bluetooth, really fun to drive.","Gas Mileage, perhaps a hybrid."

4.75,"Great SUV, but questionable gas mileage.",BONES ,07/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"For the most part this vehicle is awesome. Some people have had an issue with the exterior, but I have had nothing but compliments on its looks. It's one tough truck for sure. The handling is excellent. Although, it took some getting used to the transmission that slows you down when you take your foot off the accelerator. The turning radius is unbelievable. The only thing troubling me right now is the gas mileage. I went from a 4-runner with a V8 to the Pilot thinking I would get better mpg with a 6cyl. So far thats not the case. I primarily drive in stop and go traffic. I am only getting about 13 mpg. I do run the A/C constantly, so that may have something to do with it. Otherwise, I love it.",Exterior and interior appearance and layout. Interior is very roomy.  Homelink works great. Great sound system with XM Radio. Smooth quite ride. Almost seems luxurious at times. ,Gas mileage needs to be better. I'm getting about the same mpg I did with my V8. I'd like to see power seat controls for the passenger. I'm not crazy about the seat material. It could be a little softer cloth.

I just wish the new pilot had similar if not same mileage per tank as old model.  I was able to get close to 350 miles per tank (which was smaller) where as I only got 250 or less with new one (bigger tank).  I do notice the new one drives more like a truck with more power.  I have to agree with one of the review about the sloppy finished interior (under the driver seat has metal parts sticking out beyond the carpet).  Overall, I do love my new Pilot and my kids love the XM radio and navigation.  Not crazy about the bells and whistle but nice to have for those who might appreciated it.  I still am glad I got the car.","Navigation with rearer view camera, DVD, roomier interior, seat warmer, and keyless memory seat adjuster.  Lots of bells and whistles for the money.",Definitely a better gas mileage and LARGER glove compartment.  Glove compartment barely has room for the car manual.  The shelves above the glove compartment may sound like a good idea on paper but not very practical especially at the expense of the glove compartment size.

5,Finally decided on the Best SUV,SamanthaFox ,07/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The 2009 Honda Pilot is the best SUV I have every driven.  I have owned the 2004 Pilot that was reliable, spacious but unappealing; I have owned a Sequoia that was too big and a gas guzzler;  I have also owned a Jeep Cherokee that dragged during take off, had poor gas mileage and horrible interior. I have found the SUV that I will drive for a long time.  Thanks Honda for the new design.  I love it; love driving it; and because I like the vehicle so much, I can, almost, better deal with going to the pump to pay for unnecessarily high priced gas.","Exterior: design.

5,Very Impressed!,ejernest ,07/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After 15 years of mini vans, we finally have a ride I love to drive. We traded in our 06 Odyssey Touring. We test drove pretty much everything in this class with AWD and third row seating. We could not find another SUV in this price range that rode as nice with as much room. We also drove the 08 Pilot and there really was no comparison. The interior design improvements over the 08 probably sold us more than anything else. The additional room is what sold my wife, plus the driving comfort. I never wanted to drive her mini vans but she has trouble keeping me out of her new Pilot. At 61, Im able to sit in the third row seat comfortably. After 500 miles, we're very happy and impressed.","Sound system, fuel mileage (actual 16 in town as advertised), comfort, storage, MP3 input, body style changes.

And I am glad I did purchase this SUV. It rides great and it is so roomy inside. Other vehicles had better gas mileage and maybe a little more room in the trunk with 3rd row up, but the leg room for 3rd row was not as good as the Pilot. Also Honda has a better money returned for the vehicle than others.

5,Simply amazing,jedigiff ,07/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Honda has hit a home run with this.  Dont bother with an Acura MDX, save $10K and get the Honda Pilot with the same features.  Ride is powerful and smooth, handles like a luxury vehicle, can carry a ton.  Gets decent MPG for an SUV this size.  We have the 4x4 and are averaging 18 driving in mostly mountain roads, only 2 mpg less than our Honda Odyssey. Doubt you can improve MPG without decreasing the power, maybe Honda can come up with a hybrid model someday like the Highlander?  Couldnt be happier though.

Honda did a nice job addressing road noise issues and giving the vehicle a luxury feel without loosing its utility personality. ,"This vehicle is fun to drive. For its size, it gets respectable gas mileage and the amenities are very cleaver.",Improved towing would be a bonus and placing sensors across the entire front versus just on the corners would be nice.

When I saw the new redesign for the Pilot, I got excited and decided to wait until it came out before purchasing the other eggs.  Drove it, got it, and love it, love it, love it!
