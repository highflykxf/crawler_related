2,Not the Ultimate Driving Machine,Fred ,02/22/2016,1,2,3,,,1,4,4,4,,,"This is a great car for performance and driving dynamics. This is not a good car for reliability, quality and running costs. I've had countless check engine lights, failed window regulators, excessive oil consumption, failed steering pump, failed ABS sensors, premature headlight failures, transmission shuddering, EGV failure, and few electronic issues in the interior components. Many of these issues were covered under warranty. However, the amount of time spent in and out of the dealer was ridiculous. Some repairs like the transmission shudder couldn't be remedied. This is the worst car I've owned in terms of reliability. It's the worst in maintaining its value. I sold it at a loss but I'm very glad that I did.",,
2,Worst Car I've Ever Owned,John Brennan ,11/18/2015,1,2,4,,,1,2,4,4,,,"At 58,000 miles this BMW began failing on nearly every other drive.   Even when I was selling it, it broke down on two consecutive test drives.  The repairs were nearly $3,000.00 just for those two repairs.   It's a fun enough car when it's running correctly but, given the performance of far more economical cars, I would never consider another BMW. I also have to comment on the tires:  if you think this AWD car is going to perform in snow, you'll be disappointed.  There's  not enough tread depth in the low profile tires.   You'll need dedicated snow tires if you drive in snow regularly.     All in all, it was a bad experience.  The car is overpriced.  The dealership service department tries to gouge you (politely, of course) and the car is completely unreliable.   I would never consider another one.",,
4.5,Realistic review for people who want to buy a used 535i,rob2388 ,12/18/2013,,,5,5,4,3,,5,5,4,5,"I bought my 2009 535i with sport/cold/light packages with 49k miles. First make sure you find the service records on the car so you know what you will be facing. THIS CAR IS NOT A MAINTENANCE FREE CAR LIKE TOYOTA! With that being said, there is a lot of 'common' issues with this car. Gasket leaks, the HPFP (high pressure fuel pump) and one of the taillights have recalls so make sure you have the new HPFP. Water pump also goes to shit after about 50k miles i read so that is something i'm looking forward to. This is not a smooth car like Mercedes, you will feel the road. Other than that, the car can take serious curves, and the twin turbos make the car go!","Turbos, Exterior, Interior, 20 Way Power Seats, Handling (if equipped with sport package) ","I say BMW should stop coming up with more advance stuff and start to perfect the technology they already have, which is already years ahead from other car manufacturers.

3.625,Are you willing to trade the good for the bad?,subdsgnr ,05/01/2012,,,3,4,4,1,,5,5,2,5,"My 535i came with the sport package, which does improve handling--especially the active roll bar in the rear. This car rides almost like an Avalon in a straight line, but has almost ZERO body roll on a turn. Really amazing handling. The turbo engine is very impressive as well.HOWEVER, you cannot change your battery on your own. The dealer MUST do it.Seriously--I'm a DIY car guy. Also, I just had two injectors replaced at 20K MILES. BMW forum people act like the injectors are SUPPOSED to go out because they're just such ""high performance"", but I've had 3 Lexuses with direct inject and had ZERO problems.On top of reliability being spotty, the dealer treated me like a pariah.","Suspension, engine (when working), and seats are really great.
I really don't think there is a better suspension out there than the one with the sport package.","Ergonomics are poor compared with Lexus.
iDrive is maddening, just as pro critics say. Dealer service is VERY poor for a luxury brand.
Again, Lexus is stellar in this regard. You'd think you'd get treated better for forking over 60 grand.
BMWs have the double lock door feature and push-button start that still requires a key to be placed in the steering column, both of which are asinine. Annoys everyone who rides with me.

There are so many drawbacks when compared with my experiences with Acura, Honda, Toyota, and Lexus that I personally wouldn't trade the amazing handling for the headaches, which is saying a lot because I'm always willing to sacrifice for performance.
What about you?"
3.75,Fuel System ,Disappointed ,09/28/2010,,,4,4,4,1,,5,4,4,4,"Great car, but the problems with the fuel system are ridiculous.  4th time it has been in, reprogrammed software, new software, new fuel pump.   This is a serious safety issue as the car will not get fuel and will stop or lose acceleration.  BMW needs to take this seriously.",,
3.375,Unreliable,BMW Lemon ,06/14/2010,,,5,5,5,1,,1,5,4,1,The car was awesome at first but then came the problems the fuel system replaced 3 times. The car continues to have fuel delivery problems. BMW told me we have extended the warranty to 10 years on the fuel system but that doesn't help when you're stranded on the road. Avoid the 135/335/535 models they are garbage. I have started the lemon law process.,,
5,What a car!,Don ,01/25/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After owning many marques, finally bought a BMW. The car handles like a slot car, is quiet and good-riding, and has fantastic brakes. Wish I'd bought one years ago.",i-Drive,
3.5,Not the Ultimate Driving Machine,samsride ,01/01/2010,,,2,5,1,1,,5,5,4,5,"Thought I got the ultimate driving machine this spring. At 5K miles, check engine light came on 3 times! Fixed 3 times (software update, fuel injector replacement, new fuel pump). At 7500 miles, light came on again, lost power and car shut off! Had to be towed to dealer as fuel injector and cylinder blown to smithereens. Dealer has been responsive in replacing parts under warranty, but car is not reliable and not safe at this point. Filed for reimbursement through Lemon Law since 4th occurrence. No response from BMW after 30 days. Have found lots of others having same issues on many blogs. Stay away from turbo models!","Handling, quiet ride","No storage, bad cupholder design, turbo models have issues with fuel pump that BMW does not know how to resolve."

The 2003 could barely get out of its own way. Over the years they have increased horsepower by 50. The car drives great, handles well and is good on gas.

It still could use an upgrade on horsepower over 230.","steptronic, navigatioon, sound system",Need center console storage and the cup holders are not so great.
5,Ultimate driving Machine,Best car I've owned ,12/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"BMW truly deserves the title of ultimate driving machine. The 528i has enough power with exceptional handling and ride quality. No other car provides the same steering feedback and handling.

","sports package/kit, hd $ xm radio, comfort and handling without compromising luxury. navi that can be programmed while the car is moving. very smart & user friendly bluetooth. angel eye lights. bamboo anthracite wood trim. multi-contour seat/positions.",still only one real standout issue - idrive system needs complete overall as it seems to be over engineered. have touch screen capabilities. petal response is much better in sport mode without it petal response hesitates during launch. the cruise control stalk and cup holder are poorly placed.
5,Born to Run,pjl275 ,08/31/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just turned in my leased '07 530xi for an '09 535i.  Almost cried, as the '07 was simply an exceptional car. If it weren't for the very high buyout, I would have purchased the car.  Found a new 535i with sport pkg, nav, cold weather, etc for an absolute steal.  The changes from '07 are wonderful, better leather, the sport seats are thrones and they seemed to have fixed the noisy moonroof issue.  Not that the '07 was underpowered, but the '09 just flies.  80 comes up quickly and its really hard to obey the owner's manual to keep it under 100 during breakin. Car is very quiet, even with the sport package and the ride is as supple (if not more) than the 530xi (non-sport). Hope to keep this car.","Sport pkg, 20 way seats, handling and power.  BMW maintenance is great.  Tried Audi, MB and Infiniti, none ride or drive as well as the BMW.",The buttons they added to assist the i- drive are not needed.  The new gear selector is better suited to an Airbus control stick.  I liked the tranny stick on my old car better.  
4.875,1st BMW - I'm hooked!,CDT ,06/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Test drove the 528i and fell in love!  My husband also wanted to try out the X5...it was nice, but the handling wasn't as good as the 5series.  So, I've been driving my 528i for only a few weeks now but am in LOVE with it! I got the Premium and Sport packages.  The 20-way seat feels like it hugs my body.  Haven't used the heated seats yet in the Florida summer, but look forward to trying them out if we have a cold winter.  This is the smoothest, quietest ride I've ever had, and great acceleration.  I love the i-drive...it did take a little getting used to but the learning curve wasn't long and well worth it.    ","Handling, bamboo, Dakota leather, i- pod interface, bluetooth and voice control, and the super-comfy seats!","The only improvement needed, in my opinion, is the driver's cup holder.  It's just not large enough to hold a travel mug.  I agree with others that I wouldn't want it in the center console though.  "
5,Awesome!,Ba ,06/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my first BMW. It's incredibly comfortable and fun to drive. Great performance, stability and luxury.

4.875,Love this car,CBH ,06/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just purchased the 535i xDrive and absolutely love it.  It handles curves like no other sedan in its class. Really have to pay attention to my speed because of smooth ride. Fuel economy isn't bad for 300 horses and vehicle weight - currently getting 25 to 27 highway, but still in break-in period. Very comfortable interior with lots of room.  Could use a little more storage, but not a major issue - the golf clubs fit fine!  I do agree that the cup holders are ridiculous.

It took a little getting used to its ""heft"" compared with the 3 Series it replaced, but now that I'm used to that, and the operation of the iDrive, I really love the car.  It's very smooth and comfortable, and has deceptively great handling.  I'm still in ""break in mode"", doing more stop- and-go, and am getting about 27 mpg.  The 5 Series is just a joy to drive, puts a smile on my face every time I press that ""start"" button.","iPod integration, bluetooth phone integration, and yes iDrive (now that I'm over the learning curve)...but the best feature is the way it drives!",

Sports), have been in a 05' Mercedes CLK500 and 97'Porsche 911 Conv. It's great to own a Beemer again, don't think I'll ever go back to a Merc (quality was sub par although engine and power were amazing). Been driving my 535I sports package for the last couple of weeks and am extremely impressed, I was worried that I would miss the power of my CLK500 but have been satisfied with my 535I twin turbo engine. Interior with black bamboo is fantastic, this is the most comfortable car I have ever been in, more than enough space and the contour seats are great.

Took off the run flats and am storing them until the end of the lease.  This is the 2nd BMW I have followed this ritual.  Car handles like it is on rails.  Performance is sooo sweet.  Previously had a 530i with manual.  The extra ponies - 45 or so are noticeable and the torque comes on just above idle at 1400 and stays flat until about redline.  I commute about 45 miles to work and this beemer makes going to work fun!  Have had beemers since 2000 and they are the utmost fun to drive but run flats stink big time.

The car looks fabulous; the LED side & rear lights and Angel Eye DRLs make the car unique and very attractive.  The acceleration, handling and fuel economy are comparable to my old M3 but without the ""nervousness"".  I've never purchased a car that gave me the satisfaction of ownership that I receive from my 550i.  The whole automobile is a work of art, from the anthracite tailpipes to the black front air intake; a study in black and white.

You can notice a little more pickup, the 07 525 was  a real dog.
