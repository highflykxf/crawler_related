Since January 2015-Oct 2015 have replaced the clock speed sensor, the starter, wheel bearing, now the transmission is starting to slip. Chrysler jacked up the jeep name.

1,Beware of Transfer Case Problems and Elecronics,Mr. PM ,09/18/2015,1,1,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,"I bought my GC Laredo 4.7L used.  I had the service 4wd message in the dashboard and took it to the Jeep dealer.  The GC had some weird noise in the transfer case area.  It cost me $100.00 for a diagnostic to tell me that the transfer case was bad.  An a quote of S3,500 for a remanufactured Chrysler NV245 transfer case because Chrysler does not make those junk transfer cases anymore.  I went to a transmission shop and they installed a used one from the junk yard and couple weeks after the electric motor of the transfer case went bad.  I complained to Chrysler about the transfer case and their response was that after 100,000 I am expected to replace the transfer case.  I had 1997 Honda CRV with 297,000 plus miles without transfer case issues.",,

3.25,Very poor reliability,morzh ,06/30/2015,,,3,4,3,1,,4,4,3,4,"Well, I have been a Jeep fan for a long time. Owned a Cherokee before, was a decent car. I knew the reliability reputation full well and bought this GC against my better judgement. 
Let's say, I have paid.

Right after 4 years of very mild driving and not even 40K on odometer things started happening.

The speed sensor. $1000.
The starter. $800.
A pressure sensor leaking air. $90.
Today - another pressure sensor leaking air (the car will be 6 years old this August). $150. A $150 tire flat fix.

No more Chrysler products for me.",,

I also love taking it off road (on the beach) I have the lowest level 4x4 system and it still performs great.

4.5,Solid SUV with Good Gas Mileage,theov ,11/23/2013,,,4,5,5,4,,5,4,5,4,"I bought the 2009 GC at the end of 2009 and was able to get this 4x4 SUV at $24,750 before state taxes.The vehicle is an excellent blend of on-road and off-road prowess.On the road, the Jeep has excellent handling getting 17-18 mpg around town and 21-22 mpg on the highway.This is better than the original advertised ratings and this still holds true after 115,000 miles on the vehicle.As good as this vehicle is on the road, it really excels in the snow.I feel very confident when bad weather provides a challenge to safe driving.The Grand Cherokee handles with confidence and good feedback to allow safe driving decisions.A great, reliable used vehicle if you can get one.","1.
Better gas mileage than the ratings.
2.
Ample storage in the wagon areas and easy to fold flat seats.
3.
Confident handling in winter weather.","1.
Quieter cabin, the transmission does whine a fair amount.

Laredo and have problems with it starting at about 6,000 miles.When I acclerate going into the highway it does nothing and than all of sudden it shoots out.It does not happen all the time, but it is dangerous when you have only a certain amount of time to acclerate before a car comes up on you behind.I have complained to the dealership for over a year and half and all they have told me is they cann't find anything wrong (the computer does not regester it).I have almost had 3 accidents because of this and yesterday I had to go the side of the road in order for a truck not to plow into my rear end as we were getting on the interstate.It is at the dealer",,

Everything was going fine the first year, now that I'm into my second year with 30,000 miles on it, my Jeep has been in the shop every month. First it was an ERG valve then an ABS sensor, the following month my drain tubes from the moon roof were clogged and one day driving down the road I put on the brakes and water poured out of my overhead lights. But wait I just got back from the dealer having my blower motor replaced. Thank goodness all were covered under factory warranty,but 2000 miles left and it's my problem and the dealer wants me to trade it in for a 2011 Compass.

4.375,northland driver,mark s ,08/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,3,2,5, I am reasonably satisfied with my new jeep.  I live on a gravel road that does not always get cleared in the winter and wanted a replacement for my Tahoe (awesome in the snow) yet not so big.  ,The 5.7 liter motor is a beast in power and thirst.  The quality of the leather seats is outstanding.  As far as I am aware Chrysler is the only manufacturer offering the built in hard drive.  I have loaded at least 20 CD's into it - awesome.,I appreciate the side bolsters on the front seats but the seat is just not wide enough if you are more than a 34 waist size. Driver seat does not lower far enough - looking through top of windshield.  The 5.7 liter has deactivating cylinders which give decent highway mileage.

5,3rd one,Manny ,08/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5," This is my 3rd GC.  I've owned a 05/07 and now an 09.  Why do I keep buying them?  I love the look, comfort and drivability.  I truly can afford any SUV I want, but I'm frugal.  When you take the discounts into account this is one of the most affordable SUVs on the market today.  I literally purchased the 4 WD Laredo with the W option package for under $25K (sticker was over $36K).  Couple the price with the outstanding service department which is only 2 miles from my house and you have a pretty good combination.  Many folks are put off by the high sticker price and may not even consider the GC.  The base model competes well with the smaller cars and is a much nicer SUV.","Leather, sun roof, heated seats, boston acoustics sound system.",Work on reliability.

The drive was smoother than any CAR I've had so far. Very impressive. My only recommendation is to buy the 4.7 V8 or bigger. The 3.7 is a bit weak. However, it has enough power.

My wife and I are happy with the car so far.  The build material is decent for an American car, but not as good as other cars we considered (BMW X3, Audi Q5).  We decided on the Grand Cherokee because we got a decent deal after the Chrysler rebates and dealer incentives.  The major downside is the gas mileage, which has been dismal (for the first tank of gas).  But we are weekend drivers so hopefully this is not a major issue.",V8 Hemi engine.  Solid ride quality.

I had done a lot of research online and had narrowed my choice to a Jeep Grand Cherokee or a Ford Edge.  I had actually decided on the Edge.  After the deal fell through, I took another look at the jeep.  The dealer allowed me to take it over Memorial Day weekend and by Monday  I was sold.
