5,Saved my life,Zapataro ,10/27/2016,,,5,,,,5,4,5,,,"A car company is at it's best when it has something to prove. Mercedes with the w126, VW with the Phaeton and Hyundai with it's Genesis. Hyundai wanted to show the world that it could make a car every bit as good as the Germans and mostly they succeeded. I looked at comparable 5 series and E class automobiles, their quality, options and reliability records and could not see the value in the Germans higher prices, besides the badge. A friend, who is a BMW diehard, had to admit that my Genny was every bit as fast as his 5 series, had a nicer interior and a stereo that blew his out of the water. It's not perfect by any means though. Not as polished as the Germans. The ride wasn't quite sorted, and the traction control was absolutely terrible. Even when the traction control was ""turned off"" it was still far to intrusive, cutting in at very inopportune times.  In the year I owned it I had no troubles with it. I would have kept it for much longer had I not been T-boned by a full size van running a red light at 50mph! What I can say about that is I was able to walk away from the accident with only bumps and bruises.",,

5,MY GENESIS 4.6,jerrymax ,04/19/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I bought my 2009 Genesis six months ago strictly as a touring sedan. I quickly put 1200 miles on the odometer on a road trip and only another 1200 more since then. It is a beautiful car, very comfortable and moves like a rocket if you tap the gas. The build quality is rock solid and the 17 speaker sound system is the best I've ever heard. I'd give it a top rating on everything but the ""fun to drive"" item due to steering that is precise but feels sort of numb. But as a full-sized luxury car it's not meant to handle like a Porsche.",,

No braking at all!!!I am told the ABS module has failed and not covered by warranty at 62,199 miles as I am the 2nd owner.$2,500 repair cost.This is a chronic/common problem with Hyundais and should be covered as a recall because the engineering/manufacturing process or something is obviously is defective!Do your research as brake problems with Hyundais is way too common.Go to http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov and look for yourself",,
4.5,Just bought a 3.8 Genesis Sedan,ibuy4u ,06/11/2012,,,5,4,4,4,,4,5,5,5,"I was skeptical of Hyundai just like you. I wouldn't even look in the direction of this brand before BUT in these times...if your credit is shot due to the economy and can't get the car you drove before or want then this might be the car for you. After driving the Genesis I was pleasantly surprised! 3 main factors that caught my attention. Driveablity, Technology and Accessories. It drove like a cream puff. Smooth ""very"" smooth engine and tranny with kick when you need it. Technology available is just as good and plentiful as the rest with BMW and Audi hand controls. Accesories you would normaly have to buy as an option is included in the Genesis. Great value and warranty for the buck!","LED cockpit and footwells just like the A8. All windows go all the way down and not halfway. Power rear sunshade with auto folddown in reverse. Keyless-go works great with audible beep not horn. All doors illuminate the ground when opened. Venitilated seats warm and cold. Radio/Navigation/DVD controls at your right hand just like the BMW 7 series and Audi A6/8 models. HID adaptive headlamps. And a loud, crisp, thumping surround sound 17 speaker system. Pretty damn good for stock! And most of all, the best piece of mind you can get is 10yr 100k mile bumper to bumber warranty. Anything breaks the dealer fixes! Piece of mind=stability! ",I just bought this car (6/12) and only had it for a few weeks. No problem to report as of yet. I will post here if any issues arises. I've read alot about tranny issues or sudden acceleration etc. I'll be the judge of that and will post if I ever experience any issues. I will tell you this...I've owned high end luxury sedans and for the money...this car has ALL the accesories you demand and want. Now lets see if the car holds up mechanically wise but time will tell. Hope this post was informative to all you buyers. I bought this vechile based on a few factors. 1. If you have kids (2-3yrs olds) back seats enough room for car seats. 2. Warranty is 100k bumber-2-bumber. 3. Value. Good luck.

Electrical and transmission issues are major in this Genesis SDN 4.6L V8.

Genesis or not the one I am driving with a lot of hesitation shouldn't even be on the road.

It's pretty bad when the service manager tell you he's replaced a lot of techs. because they were failing to make repairs when in fact they were not!

The dealer replaced them commenting they had never seen anything like that before. After the next 8000 miles the remaing two tires were also bald, but the dealer and Hyundai refused to replace.

Its now been 2 years since my regretable purchase. Please let me reassure you I am a REAL Person and not a rep from some other ripoff car company like BMW!Tires very cheap replaced at 12,000 miles! Key needs to be within 1 foot or placed in slot to operate the pushbutton start!. Terrible in the snow and wet roads with the rear drive!Backup camera works 50% of time! You need a Hyundai brand I-Pod cable to work you I-Pod connection (Extra 75.00) Hmm never mentioned!The Transmnission shifting is a Nightmare and very embarrasing! Frequent updates for stereo _ etc. Im outta words with alottt more to say!","I have more to add from above. There really is no favorite feature to this car. Only that you dont see alot of them around.. Gee, now I know why! You have to have a college degree to operate the GPS system which is 20 some pages to read and does not make sense.. I went on you tube and watched the operating techniques. Again what a major ripoff with the cheapppp tires they slap on the car.. many cut corners.

tried to push a cheap Sonota on me which I had to deny and battle for the Genesis.. again, which They promised!","Fix ALL the Many problems.. Its just not me, I've read the other reviews and the people who have not complained yet.. well, just wait and give them ample time!

3.75,Wouldn't Buy Another One,Anonymous ,12/06/2010,,,5,5,3,3,,4,3,4,3,"This car is not an entrance to the luxury class by a long shot.  The transmission in my car is an abomination to the name of luxury car. It shifts with jerky motions, can't find the gear it needs to run in and has to catch up to the engine after braking. Two trips to the dealership and I have been assured that this transmission is within Hyundai specs.  The cruise control loses 3MPH up any grade hill and gains up to 3MPH down the hill. I have a 2002 I-35 that keeps set speed dead-on. I think Hyundai needs to reverse engineer an Infinity transmission and cruise control.  The ride is rough and the engine is noisy. Other than that the car is OK.","Outside and inside styling, among the best on the road",None because I won't be concerned with the next one.
2.125,Terrible Car / Forgettable experience,Sandy ,12/02/2010,,,3,2,2,2,,2,2,2,2,"After almost decades of owning premium / luxury cars, I made the regrettable decision to buy a Hyundai. All my friends and family were skeptical. I have spent the past several months working with dealers and HMA Consumer Affairs to address the problems. Every time they tell me they DO NOT see the problems. Is anyone else having these problems? The whole experience has been extremely disappointing. 1. Rattling / grinding sound when driving at lower gears 2. Jerky transmission shifts 3. Squeaking / cranking sound from the rear seat when driving 4. Loud rumbling noise when starting the car 5. Vibrations while driving 6. Tires worn out at 25k miles 7. Cruise control does not work",Interior space,Hyundai should properly test their car before putting it on the market. Hyundai consumer affairs and dealer service departments need to be better trained and show empathy to customers and stop making excuses! 
5,Great car even with problems,Genesis ,11/28/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought mine used w/ 18,000 miles on it.  It's the 3.8 w/ all options and now has 25,000 miles on it.  It has been flawless with one exception - an electrical problem that effected the stereo.  After replacing all components (some twice), Hyundai had over $18,000 in parts at retail price back into it. I was also without it for at least a month.  Also, I hadn't had the car for a week when the a stone hit the condenser and I was hit with a $530 bill to fix it.  Overall, I haven't been pleased with they responses from Hyundai, but the dealership tried hard to make my happy.  All of that aside, I still love the car.","I love the way the car looks (both inside and out), drives, comfort of seats and the quality of materials used.  I get lots of looks with people trying to figure out what it is.  I was looking at the E Class, but am glad I made the decision I to try the Genesis.  W/ everything now working, I love it","While I enjoy the stereo, it's not nearly as good as others I've owned.  The price to fix items is absurd and the inability to get parts is crazy - sometimes up to a month for a part.  They need to be more honest w/ the warranty.  It's only 3 years 36k on electronics.

5,E Class  MB has nothing on this car!,lag ,10/31/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The factory Dunlop Sport 5000 tires were a disaster--noisy, rough riding. They might be fine if your planning on doing some late night ""drifting""in your local Walmart parking lot! I doubt that most purchased this car with that in mind! Most of my driving is long distance touring and those tires were not compatible with that driving style--replaced with Kumho Ecsta LX Platinum ""sneaks""--what a difference--very quiet--very smooth--great wet road traction and all but eliminated that choppy ride except on real bumpy back roads. Not quite the ride of the E Class MB (realistically the benchmark of ""smooth"") I dumped but real close on the open road--definitely not worth the price difference!  ","Fit, finish, interior and exterior design, comfort, ride(after ditching those Dunlops), performance, mpg(consistently over 30 mph on highway trips on regular fuel).

4.5,I just bought it,zoodoo11 ,10/17/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,4,3,5,5,"I saw the commercial for the Genesis, had to check it out.  The car looks good, inside and out.  Both the driver and passenger have power seats.  Plenty of pick up, 290 horse.  When the windows rolled up nothing but quiet.","The stereo system, out of sight. plenty of acceleration.","The seats are very hard.  I went to an upholsterer.  Added foam to the drivers seat.  The passenger seat is the same way.  The car came with tinted windows, at night hard to see cars from behind, the windows are very dark.   When going over bumps feels like your in a truck, very hard.

4.625,Love My Genesis,Sharon ,09/20/2010,,,4,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I love this car.  It is unmistakably the most beautiful car I have ever owned.  It turns heads every day and the color (Cabernet) is gorgeous.  Most of the complements I get are on the color.  The paint is flawless even after 7 months of 95 degree, blazing sunlight.  The performance is impressive and the interior, quiet and comfortable.  I love the sound system and the tech package works great.  I  had to have the console control replaced under warranty and there was a problem with an emission control part that was also covered under the warranty.  Other than those minor inconveniences, I really am happy with my car.  My only complaint with the car, is the ride.  It rattles my teeth.","Overall look and performance of the vehicle.  Navigation system is excellent.  Car is beautiful, and has people following me around to see what it is.  Dealership service dept. courteous and tries hard to please.

I will be turning the car in soon and finding a replacement due to some issues I have with the car.  The stereo has terrible sound quality.  They claim this car has the same stereo as a Roll Royce.  Well I guess the stereo sound is bad in a Rolls too.  The car has plenty of power but has a problem putting the power to the road.  The six-speed transmission has a shift point from 1st to 2nd right in the middle of a turn from a stop that makes the car ""jump"" and engage the traction control.

5,Long-term Update,TNCPA ,06/13/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Ride quality appears to be the most negative comment by owners.  Replacing the Dunlop OEM tires with Pirelli Pzero Neros ) at (13,000 miles) essentially solved any harsh ride issues that I had with car.  The change in the handling and ride quality has been simply amazing. ",All comments made in my original evaluation remain.  Navigation stands out with simplicity to use as compared to my Acura MDX.

The dealer towed the car and come to find out the rear engine seal failed; they still don't have a clue as to why.  They are putting a brand new engine in it at no cost to me so their service has been A+. They are sending the old engine back to the company to investigate.  Their engineers and mechanics could not find a reason for the failure, that is why the old engine is being returned to their factory to try and find out why.

One test drive and we were sold...done deal!  We have already put 12,000 miles on it and have ZERO regrets.  I do recommend re-badging this car.  I found some neat ""winged"" Genesis badges on Ebay (very much like the Bently badge), pulled the Hyundai badge off the rear and replaced with the new, and added a badge to the front hood.

It truly does look like a 7-series BMW, or a S-series Mercedes, but many mistake it for a Maybach or even Rolls because I opted for the ""Genesis Wings"" logo vs. the Hyundai ""H"".

With 5 cars in the garage we have a choice, and without fault the car that is out of the garage first is the Genesis.

And here's the best part, since I've owned the car the only service required has been scheduled maintenance.  No rattles, no signs of wearing, and still fun to drive.  In the snow (we had an 18 in. snow storm last week), it handled better than expected.  I did struggle up a steep hill that wasn't plowed well (4"" of loose snow on road) but otherwise the car did fine. I don't have any issues sports handling - but the ride could be smoother.

Specifically, I tested the BMW 535, Audi A6, Cadillac CTS and Mercedes E350. I have also owned Lexus vehicles. I was leaning toward the BMW but had not tested the Genesis during this time span. I had established a price range and didn't want to go north of $70k. After ten minutes in the Genesis there was no doubt in my mind that this car was the best of the group. The handling, spaciousness, quietness and overall good feeling left me with the impression that the other brands were over priced. The difference in the overall savings gives me free fuel and insurance over the 36 month lease.",Handling is superb for a 4000 lb. vehicle.

But my electrical system hasn't been right since I drove it off the lot.  So just be aware that the system is intricate, and new, so when things start going wrong, you may find yourself visiting the dealership MANY times to give them a chance to get it right.  I've been at least 6 times since I purchased the NEW car, and it's still not fixed.

One Genesis test drive was for more than an hour. We were not surprised by the stiffness of the Genesis ride.  Highway ride and quietness are excellent.

4.75,what an amazing value!,JoeManGA ,12/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"After much research and test driving I bought the Genesis 4.6 with tech package.  I was a bit hesitant because the ride was a bit more firm and sporty than what I was used to with my Avalon.   After 2 months, I have to say the ride is no longer an issue and I prefer the suspension in the Genesis to my ""couch on wheel"" ride I had before.   I still can't believe I paid $36.7K plus T&T.   It's just silly to think people pay $50 and $60K for comparable vehicles.   I also got the wing emblems on wheels, trunk and steering wheel.  It looks fantastic and I've received many stares and compliments on the car.  The ES350 was the only other alternative, but it is much smaller and has a dated interior.","The electronics in this car are fantastic - great response time on the Nav, XM and all other features.

I have experienced no mechanical or other type problems.  The car is very comfortable on long trips, although I sometimes prefer a cushier ride to the more stiff sport suspension on this vehicle. My only 2 complaints are the Lexicon sound system is not as good as it is cracked up to be in my opinion and the blue tooth interface is not as compatible as it claims to be with certain phone models.

I also got lucky to have the wings on the trunk.This car kept every promise from riding comfort,road handling, to exceptional sound, and all the electronics are working very well with the small navigation button. I had Mercedes and still have a BMW; Genesis compares extremely well. You have to go into BMW 700 category and the 550 Mercedes class, which will cost accordingly. And yes I had more than a dozen people ask me if it is a Bentley (because of the wings in the back).","Style, ride, and comfort in driving, listening to Lexicon, and the way the car is put together.

5,Outstanding car,Carguy ,10/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"   Hyundai has done just about everything right on the Genesis. There have been complaints about the ride.  I find that tire pressure is the problem (and maybe the Dunlop tire as well). The techs at the dealer or tire store will put the tire pressure up to 35 psi.  This will produce a rough ride. If you reduce the pressure to  32-33 psi,  the ride will be about like a Mercedes E class.  I find this to be about right.  30 psi would be even better but the low tire pressure system will signal low tire pressure if it gets below 30 and you have to run it up to 35 to reset the system and get the low pressure message off. Buy a good tire pressure gage and set the pressure yourself. ","Looks, power, 6 speed auto trans",Could use more cup holders.

My Genesis has several little problems that my dealer claims is on all the Genesis cars and they can't fix them.  Plus the programming of many of the car's functions leaves alot to be desired.  I agree the the car has excellent performance but a car that frustrates you every time you drive it is not a pleasure.  Perhaps I expect too much by thinking that a $40,000 auto should have all the bugs worked out before it is put on the market but I don't think so.  Perhaps I am spoiled by Lexus but relatively speaking, this car does not meet my expectations of  $40,000 car ",The power and pickup is great and the braking in excellent. The back up camera is excellent on the large GPS screen.,Fix the bugs and get the fixes to the dealers.  Improve the defrost function.

The suspension system is horrible. When the tires are cold you can feel every tar strip in the highway. The guys who designed the suspension should not be allowed to graduate fro high school this year. The steering is also numb and it becomes very tiring to be driving with the intent to find a good centerline feel and have that suspension fighting me.

5,This Car is a contender,JOnstone ,08/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got this car yesterday after test driving this vehicle. I certainly can say that the Genesis has a one of a kind personality. Though the car feels much more expensive, with luxurious appointments, the price paid was only 41,500 with all the options laid out.  ","Bluetooth for multi-tasking and a very easy navigation system. The car is very comfortable. And, the back-seat drivers feel chauffeured to their way a destination. the interior size is truly a nice thing to appreciate  Extremely safe car. ","Ummm...... Maybe I should have waited for the 2010 Genesis. Hyundai is developing a state-of-the-art 6 speed transmission which will be butter smooth. As well, as more fuel efficient. The Break Feel can improve a slight touch."
4.75,Incredible car for the money,MS1 ,08/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Have had mine for only 3 weeks but I am loving this car.  I am constantly being stopped in the parking lot to find out what kind of car it is.  It is roomy, powerful, and luxurious.  I drove Lexus E350, Infiniti M35, BMW 535 and this.  Bought the Hyundai the next week and have no regrets.  It stands out in the crowd of those cars on the road and is much less expensive.  The ride quality is excellent in my opinion.  I ride normal roads, some good and some bad, but I don't see where people are coming from in saying the ride quality is bad.  This is a helluva car.","AC seat, rear camera, Lexicon sound system is incredible, powerful engine,quick braking, telescoping headlamps.",Address book sync for bluetooth enabled phone.  Larger cup holders.
5,Homerun of a deal,Mark R ,08/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got my 3.8 with the technology package and I can not say enough about the car. I also deflated the tire pressure to improve passenger comfort. It is interesting to hear people complain about the suspension, when in fact Hondas, Mazdas, and now fords ride give me a backache every time I drive one.  The dealership experience was solid. It felt like I was getting a luxury car at a costco. There was nothing wrong with the dealers at Hyundai. They treated me well, they knew the details about the Genesis. As well, they did not rush me or push me to make a purchase on the Hyundai.",Good interior appointments and bluetooth/Mp3 integration. The navigation system is a breeze to use. And the car is truly spacious. Good handling car with that independent five link suspension. The doors slam with a solid thud. As well the Car is very well built.,soften the ride a little bit. The Hyundai engineers should figure a way to create a 2 mode suspension system to give the option to customers for a rider's car or a lounge/cruise car.
4.875,Great All Around,gen 36 ,08/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"You just can't get more car for the buck than the Genesis.  I wanted an entry full-size luxury car for a little over $30k, and so my options were limited.  Shopped against Toyota Avalon, a few Buick models, Ford Taurus, even the Hyundai azera, and there's no contest here.  Of course one can get a used Lexus or something, but I wanted a new car, plus Hyundai has the great warranty.  And even if I could afford a new Lexus es or gs, I'd much Rather save the money for gas and go with the no-name Genesis.    ","ext and int styling.  nothing original, but it's just a good looking car.  Also, the engine (v6) is powerful, quiet, and has surprisingly good fuel economy.  Also, there's just nothing pretentious about driving a genesis, and i like that.

5,Great car.,Jeannie ,08/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I really love this car.  The price was great.  I got every option you could purchase and it is alot of fun to drive.  The Nav system is superior.  I think the Nav system is overpriced but worth it for me.  The only complaint I have is about the road noise.  I could really tell the difference between this car and my old car when I went thru the car wash.  It was much louder.  My old car was a Lincoln LS. To get a comparable Lincoln I would have had to spend about $10,000 more.   ",Nav system is great and very very easy to learn.  Headlights turn with me.  Rear camera system.  I have trouble backing up any other car without it.  It is amazing how fast you get use to it.  Interior colors get many compliments. (black and brown) Car price was great.,Sun visors feel cheap.

Only thing that ruins this car is its suspension.  It is fun to drive but it is NOT COMFORTABLE with its crappy suspension design.  The 7-speaker system is good.  And trunk, glove box and handrest box are big but no partition at all.  There is no way to organize the items, quite a mess.  Many people starred the car while driving.  And it brings some talks with friends and strangers while parking.  Water came into trunk when open.  Please and Please fix the suspension in all effort for the pioneer (who bought the first year Genesis) as the compensation.","1. HID 2. The look (inside and outside) 3. Super Quiet, loved it so much (Hope no rattles in future) 4. Cheap Insurance (bcos it is hyundai I guess) 5. Good value with this kinda price.","1. Hyundai should fire the Suspension design Team or at least the team lead. 2. Backseat cannot be folded 3. Water comes into Trunk when open (I don't believe it, but yah, what a dump design) 4.

4.75,A Follow Up Review,AAL3 ,08/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5," A follow up since my last review back in May. I now have 2500 miles on it and it is still doing just fine. This piece of advice may help with those complaining about the hard ride, I just spoke with my Hyundai Service Manager about softening up the ride. He told me that the car comes from the factory with a hard rubber tire, and that if it had a softer rubber tire on it, it would ride better with less bumps.  I'm not complaining, I still have all the luxury, I still have over $25,000 in my pocket vs owning one of those other high end luxury brands,its cheaper maintance, and EVERYONE STILL WALKS AROUND THE CAR ADMIRING IT. I'm just waiting on Hyundai to Appreciate us Genesis's owners ",EVERYTHING,NO PASSENGER COOLED SEATS
4.875,Incredible driving machine,nova driver ,08/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love this car.  I was in the market for a BMW 535i (also considered Audi A6 and Infinity M35) until test driving the Genesis 4.6 with Tech package.  Power and acceleration are great, delivered smoothly and eagerly.  Handling is also very capable considering the large size of the car.  The car is extremely quiet, even with sunroof tilted, making it easy to enjoy the 17-speaker Lexicon stereo (with CD/DVD-audio player and MP3/iPod inputs).  Fit and finish is excellent, and I really like the clean, intuitive layout and controls.  Technology is well integrated and works well (Bluetooth, voice recognition, etc.).","Power and performance, quietness and refinement, fit and finish, Lexicon stereo, technology and navigation system, build quality, lots of luxury features (to many to name!)","A few minor tweaks would make this an even better car:  cooled/ventilated seat for passenger (not just driver), address book transfer over Bluetooth, and power-folding (not just power tilting) side mirrors."

Had to shut down. Access steering would run halfway down and would have to manually reposition it.  Rear air would intermittently go to full hot (so much the the center console and side of the drvr seat was hot to touch). These's a tech order out on the heat but the dealer is not allowed to change the part unless they can duplicate the problem.Now the ""new"" Tau engine is knocking for the first few minutes after start indicating a possible internal lubrication problem (dealer not sure if problem). First start of the day get out and listen.",Nav system ease of operation and ride comfort. Interior fit and finish. Cockpit control locations.

I just sold my Lexus so I am used to a nice ride but this takes the cake. The way the car excellerates and handles is very impressive. I love the quality of this car both in and out. The controls are very will thought out and every one of them seems to be placed where it needs to be. I think I am going to enjoy this car for years to come - thank you Hyundai",It is all in the ride and feel of the car when driving it. The power of the engine and the quiet ride make this car worth every nickel,I do have a couple of suggestions for improvement but they are so minor they are almost not worth mentioning. The passenger seat should be height adjustable. The front cup holders should be further apart. There should be a compartment for eyeglasses. The Genesis logo and 6 CD changer on base model.
5,This car is sick!,Jennifer ,08/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Hyundai went above and beyond with this car. TOO MUCH FUN!!! For the money, there is not a better value on the market, period.  I love the  fact that this car is indeed a Hyundai, which appeals to a person like myself who wants luxury without the cliche of owning Infiniti, Mercedes, BMW, etc.  The surprise that comes with the discovery that it's a Hyundai is priceless.  I've had a few issues with the AFLS (Adaptive Front Lighting System) and she was in the shop 3 times in about 2 weeks.  Eek!  But that's been the only issue, and considering it's a production model I was expecting a lot worse.  True, it's been less than a month but I don't care, she's here to stay!","Push button start, surround sound, voice activated controls, GPS with a yellow pages built into the system so that my car can find my a hotel, restaurant, anything and just take me there; interior, sun roof, auto rear shade, exterior - I LOVE this car!",Adaptive cruise control would be a nice perk but overall this is a wonderful car.

4.5,Very Poor Suspension,fdooleysr ,08/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,3,The plain truth about the 2009 Genesis is that it has a horrible suspension and rides like an old truck. You can feel every bump in the road. I think you could run over a fishing worm and feel it. This severe defect is not immediately noticeable during a short test drive. The dealer states that this is designed into the car because it is a high performance automobile. It is fairly smooth on the interstate but it jitters and bounces over suburban streets. The ride is the most important element of a car and it fails my expectations. I'm not alone in my review of the suspension. Read the Hyundai Genesis Web site for more. The car is a beautiful car in all other aspects it is fantastic.,"The car's quietness, and the pep of the V8 engine are noteworthy.","Replace the suspension system. It will be the downfall of an otherwise fantastic automobile. It doesn't rate the title of ""North American Car of the Year"" because of its ride."

I not had any issues and it is a great value.  I am averaging 23 mpg in mixed driving.  My friends with more expensive cars (E- series, Lexus LS, etc.) cannot believe the bargain.  In fact, my boss just traded in his Infinity M45 on a v8 Genesis.  Claims he saved over $150 per month on his lease and gave up very little in luxury or performance.  ",What I like best: - Luxurious and roomy interior - The Lexicon sound system and the Tech package are absolutely awesome. - The price - Quiet ride - The Lexicon system (worth repeating- it's that good!  ,- Ability to import phonebook into bluetooth - Adaptive cruise control - blind spot monitor - put all features on the passenger seat that come with drivers seat - Adjust suspension to reduce bounce at low speeds on uneven roads - Improve the dealer experience -not on par with luxury car dealers

But, to my surprise, it was a Hyundai, out of all cars. That car I saw provoked me to look at the Genesis. I test drove the darn vehicle and I never looked back. I can say for certain that, like other posters, test driving the Genesis is a sure fire way take the Hyundai into your garage. ",Eerily quiet ride. I can hear a pin drop on the mat. The level of strength in the chassis makes it look like tank. But the surprising revelation is to realize the big Genesis is a hauler. And it can handle like smaller car. Something a bigger car should not be able to do.,"I agree with one of the posters here. Some people actually snickered at me, when I told them that it was a Korean Hyundai. Little do they know that Hyundai is a well respected #1 shipbuilding manufacturer. Soon they will climb in the Automotive field as well.  Change the Luxury Marque."

It exudes class and the fit and finish and appointments compete with the best in the industry.  The dark secret is that it has horrible suspension and rides like a truck. This severe defect is not immediately noticeable - the suspension has a dual personality. It is beautifully smooth on the interstate but it jitters and bounces over suburban streets. It is horrible to drive and I regret leasing it. I am deeply disappointed. A short test drive doesn't reveal the quirky suspension characteristics.  ""This beautiful girl has a bad personality"". Beauty is more than skin deep.","Everything! The way it looks, interior appointments, fit and finish, lots of features, lots of room and peppy performance with the refined V6 although it could have a more sensitive throttle. I love everything about this car, except having to drive it.","If Hyundai wants to become a serious player, they need to fix the suspension NOW. It rides like a 15 year old Ford F150. The Genesis doesn't even ride like a car, let alone a luxury car. This is why I rate the comfort and fun to drive ratings as low. Everything is so right except the suspension. "
5,A wonderful Car,Jose R ,07/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I bought this car for about 42K even. And I can not say enough about this car. It has everything I would ever want and then some. I can say for sure that the engine is very powerful and the handling is great.,the Lexicon  Audio is superb quality. The quietness of the interior makes this a true luxury marque.

4.875,4.6 w/Tech,Tech Junkie ,07/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car blows me away - it's worth every penny, the technology is top-notch, the interior is unbelievable.  It's quiet, comfortable, and tons of power.  My only complaint (reason for 9 in comfort) is road noise from the Dunlops and a little stiffer ride than I would have expected. Aside from this, it's still one of the quietest cars I've been in.  Wing badges are essential, but leave the flying H on if you really want to raise eyebrows. HD radio = awesome. XM = not really all that awesome after listening to HD.  Navigation works very well.  Seats are VERY comfortable for me even at 6'6"" and over 300lb. Best of all = wife loves it.",Lexicon + laminated front glass = audiophile's dream.  Gauges and trim illumination at night feels like a spaceship cockpit.  The V8 purrs...and screams - very smooth power curve. Camera and parking assist are VERY nice.,"Slightly longer delay in shifting than expected, could be a little quicker shifting.  Dunlop tires (at least the 18's) are noisy but do offer good traction. Bring on the supercharger!

4.625,I'm Impressed,Marshall ,07/15/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"The 4.6 Hyundai replaced my lease expired Chrysler 300 Hemi. The Hyundai is a better driving car and has more luxury features. The ride is smoother and quieter, the quietness being my first impression when I test drove the car. I don't think it has quite the acceleration of the Chrysler, but way more than enough for the traffic situations I drive in.  The Hyundai exterior design is not as impressive as the Chrysler, but the interior is beautiful. The car is loaded with a surprising amount of luxury features, for the price. The car is as roomy as the Chrysler and has as much trunk space. The seats are well designed for comfort. Driver controls and pushbottons are readily accessible.",Quiet soft ride is most impressive. I also like the electronic push-button start system that makes it very difficult to lock your key in the car.  Very important to forgetful people like me. ,Driver side rear view mirror poorly positioned. Blocks view of nearby on- coming traffic and objects. Annoying when making a left turn. Home-link button to garage door not easy to see at night. Have to turn on map light. Audio signal for parking brake release when starting car would be nice.

5,It is a very good car for the price.,Joe ,07/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"You can not find a better deal than the Hyundai Genesis. I actually think that Hyundai is subsidizing this car in the United States to raise their image in North America and abroad. If people can not appreciate a 60K dollar car that is priced at just 33K dollars, what will make American customers satisfied?  ","290 BHP, Amenities like a beautiful interior, sound system, whisper quiet ride, handling prowess",The badge will not sell this car unfortunately. I do think Hyundai needs to rebrand this car to a sexy and sleek name. The badge also needs to be accentuated to promotes its own prestige in the luxury market.

While the Lexus ride is smoother, Genesis matches most everything else.  Why pay more?

The engine stalls pulling out into traffic, which is terrifying.  You can't stand to sit in it for more than 30 minutes.  It vibrates.

Acceleration is super, really puts you back in your seat.  The handling is spot on, very tight in the turn and you have a great feel of the road.  Best of all we love all the gadgets.  We got the tech package and it is worth every penny.  The sound system is unmatched and the driver's information system is as good as I've ever seen.  Lexis, BMW, and Benz need to really be worried.  Same quality and service for 2/3 the price.",V8 and tech package.  The fit and finish is really top quality,

I like quiet comfort and no mechanical problems, and so far so good.  The Genesis has the exterior styling of much more expensive BMW and Lexus sedans and the interior is roomier than the Town Cars and the Q. The back seat leg room is amazing and without skimping on trunk space.  The trunk is half again larger than the Q. The V6 has plenty of power and the transmission is as smooth as can be.  My mileage depends on the brand of gas, and I get 29 mpg on brand name regular, and 25.5 on off-brand, a 10% trade off.  The Q was 20 mpg on premium.","The comfort & ride, the power, the mileage on regular gas, and the luxury looks inside and out.  The XM is wonderful.  The trunk is huge and there's a little door from the trunk to the inside between the back seats for long items.  The keyless access and ignition are nice features.  The 18"" wheels.","Wind & road noise in cabin at highway speeds disappoints.  My other luxury cars were significantly quieter. Opinion: the $4,000 GPS package is overpriced; I passed.

After test driving BMW, Acura, Lexus and others, Hyundai earned my business because the Genesis is every bit the car it is represented to be.  As far as I can see, they didn't cut any corners.  I work in an industry where image is very important and this car gets tremendous compliments from clients, valet workers and strangers.  ",The V8 is the best feature.  Mustang GT power but I got 27mpg on my last big road trip (and I was doing 80mph most of the way).  2nd best feature is the styling which is on par with Mercedes and BMW.,"Ride, while taut and secure, can sometimes border on stiff.  Sometimes feels 'nervous' over uneven/broken roads.  2nd suggestion would be to have an extender built into the sun visors to catch those holes by the rearview mirror. "

I have two complaints; 1.The suspension seems to hit the bump stops quite often on choppy roads. 2.Sometimes the rear doors wont automatically unlock.

The suspension has been a topic of discussion for many.  In some circumstances, there is a little more bounce than I'd expect and in others I cannot believe how smooth the car handles.

A quick 300 mile trek jumped it up to 28 mpg. I see other complaints about the suspension but we are pleased with our car; the wind and bumpy roads do not affect the ride that much and is an exceptionally quiet ride.

They tried to apply the T63 update and after three tries quit because the second DVD of 3 was rejected. The technicians called Hyundai tech support all day and got no response from the tech people. My radio is OK but NAV stopped working and all works Verrrrry slooooowly. They promise to get this fixed. My beef is with Hyundai tech support. What right do they have not to call back all day to a dealership needing help? I called the consumer line and was told by the only person I could reach that he would call a regional manager- obviously a useless ploy. Hyundai needs to get organized/return calls!!,Rides very well. Comfortable. Plenty of power in six cylinder.

However, I am so impressed with how this car feels and performs that I am compelled to write something.   Prior to making this purchase, I checked every available review, both professional and consumer, and I shopped every available source.  When it became clear that this car was one that I should strongly consider, I agonized over whether I would buy a 3.8 or 4.6 variant.  For the difference in price, I am happy with my choice although both cars are winners.  I have owned a stable of fine cars over the years, and, Hyundai just didn't appeal to me...until now!","The Lexicon stereo system melts the senses.

When I first test drove it, I noticed it was a bit bumpy, but I thought maybe it was because of the road I was on. I also noticed a few reviews mentioned bumpiness. But when I test drove it the second time it felt OK so I went ahead and leased it. After I took it home, I started feeling that the bumpiness was quite pronounced and at times jarring. I often find myself getting bumped up out of my seat, akin to the feeling of airplane turbulence. The vehicle has an odd combination of soft and hard ride.

An impulse buy really, but I'm beginning to see why the car is so much cheaper than my BMW.  The engine is pretty nice, but in no way compares with my 550i's V8 (torque curve, etc).  I'm pretty particular about my cars, and it's the little details with the Genesis that turn me off.  The materials just feel inferior, and it just seems like Hyundai stole design features from all of their so- called ""competitors"", down to the fake iDrive and 5-series exterior styling cues.  I think the buyers of this car will realize over time that this car is just a flashy attempt at producing a true luxury car w/o any substance.","Ride similar to my wife's old Lexus; sound sys. is better than any equivalent Toyota. I can definitely see choosing this car over say an Acura or lower end Lexus, but just don't see how they say it competes with the German luxury makes or top- end Lexus sedans.","Market these cars against their true competitors, like the Toyota Avalon, Camary, Acuras, etc.  This car is not in the same league as Audi, BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus.

There is a luxury about the Genesis that ""drove"" me to it. Everything so far is excellent... As with all new model cars there maybe an issue or two that comes up. Genesis provides the higher cost models (Lexus/BMW/Acura/Mercedes, etc)  a true run for the money. The 5 year BTB is one of the key components for the purchase.  Hyundai's decision to extend the extra year was a thoughtful and calculated one. I agree with all previous comments from other owners.  I did research for at least 6-9 months prior to purchase and I am glad I did.  The service is key to post purchase and success to Hyundai.",Agree with all previous comments.  As Hyundai builds the 2010 Genesis I am sure they will incorporate the features that most 2009 owners have strongly suggested.  I am waiting for a direct call from either the Regional or National Hyundai Office to discuss the issues for improvements.,"Again, I agree with previous comments.  If there are ways to correct some of the discrepancies now for the 2009, ex: a coin tray to replace ash tray. That would be a benefit and shows response to the consumer/owner.

The Genesis is absolutely no exception.  I went in for an oil change on my old Elantra, test drove the Genesis, and got it that day.  At least once a day I have someone comment on how much they love the look of the car.  The solid performance rounds out a really great package.  Be careful though if you live in colder climates, the car is a real wheel drive which is great when it is nice out, and even in the rain but when it snows, the car struggles for traction (I spent 35 minutes today stuck on the side of a slightly inclined road while other cars passed)","The styling, ride, acceleration, and interior size (the trunk is tremendous and the back seats are very comfortable)",All wheel drive...the car handles horribly in the snow (especially from dead stops or on hills) and the stability control provides little help in those situations.

I also own a 2005 Infiniti and the build quality on the Genesis beats the Infiniti hands down.  The acceleration on the V8 is amazing.  Given the fairly similar fuel economy to the V6 and all the small extras you get with the 8, it's definitely worth the few extra bucks.  I've driven an LS 430 several times and can say that this car knocks the Lexus out of the ballpark. Anyone who owns any of the major luxury brands and is in the market for a new ride should not discount this car simply because it's a Hyundai -- and if they do, it's their loss.","Remarkable acceleration, whisper quiet interior, decent balance between ride and handling; tech package is a must.

The ride is comfortable yet responsive. The interior is ample. I'm built like an NFL defensive end and I'm very comfortable. The amenities are numerous, you get a lot with the standard package. I have the Premium Plus and I'm very happy. The trunk is spacious. The V-6 290 bhp engine is as smooth as butter on a hot muffin and you can cruise at 80 mph without nary a concern. An All-Wheel drive version would be too sweet! The stereo system is very nice, audiophile worthy. A great buy if you're into affordable luxury and you tend not to follow the ""label"".","The engine is too nice; Strong, quiet and responsive.

Have owned many cars and currently have a 528i in the garage.  The Genesis is an extraordinary vehicle in that it is 'smooth' - driving it is actually almost a pleasure (I drive over 100 miles a day for work). It is not as tight as the 5 series, but has more power than the 528.  Refined, many options, very quiet, awesome interior detail.  Not sure it will hold it's value over time but jumped on a great lease deal for the premium plus package.

","Lexicon sound system, excellent navigation, very roomy passenger area, large trunk, plenty of power coupled with reasonable gas mileage.",Passenger seat should have same power features as driver's seat.

5,A Lot of Bang for the Buck,LonMan ,11/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I have owned a lot of vehicles before we purchased the Genesis; some very good and some bad. As we age and not into status or snob appeal any longer value,reliability, warranty coverage, and styling are important. Brand cachet was certainly not a consideration when we bought a 2006 Sonata LX (loaded V6). It is a great car for the money. Superb gas mileage for a 235 hp V6 and plenty of good features.So when the Genesis made it's debut in the lux arena we bought a White Satin Pearl 3.8 w/tech package as it came off of the truck. A year of due diligence in the form of technical research, auto magazine and critical reviews sold me on another Hyundai. What an awesome vehicle!","Actually too many great features with the tech package, but the voice commands to replace your hands is great. Also the quiet cabin is amazing - how did they do that? The interior is stunning and that came from MB owner! The suspension system with road sensing ability and stability control...wow!!",If you get the tech package be prepared for a lot of reading! So far operation of the Nav System has not been real intuitive...for me anyway. My wife has picked it up quicker. The passenger seat should have the cooling capability too; a bad oversight.

I continue to study the driver services and reserve any comments on that part at this time.

If you are reading this and are thinking of buying a BMW, Lexus or MB you need to drive this car.   Traded our Volvo s60 R for this car and I couldn't be happier. The steering is not as tight as a BMW or MB and the ride is softer but thats okay for my driving habits.   I had a deal for a nicely optioned  2008 BMW 535I that fell through.When all was said and done we financed $17k less for a fully loaded Genesis 4.6.

Bought a V6 with all the bells and whistles the next day. 2 weeks, 500 miles later I was at the repair center because the stereo was wigging out. They replaced the $4K head unit which made no difference. Now they are replacing the amp hoping that will fix it. The alignment has been pulling to the left since I bought it and they supposedly fixed that too. Nope, still pulls left.

The dealership was sensitive to the upscale nature of the car and us being informed buyers. It has been BIG fun so far with the head turns (there are only 3-4 in Tyler TX (our home) so far. And we are adding all of the 'wings' extras to personalize it from KAI. The trim is the premium plus with the technology package. We wanted the V8, but.. they can't keep them on the lot! I was ok with the power of the V6, but missed some of the trim that is only available on the V8. BUT, we're adding most back in. LOVE it!",For the first shot out- Hyundai got SO much right. I love the quiet ride at 90+mph (shhhh). Attention to serious features. The sound system- WOW!

On our first 1100 mile trip with mileage divided 80/20 between Interstate and local/city, we averaged 29.4 mpg.  The comfort level is beyond any other car we've owned.  The engine is nearly silent and very strong -- it loafs at 75 mph on the Interstate.

Test drove the 2009 Maxima, 2008 Acura TL, and the Genesis.  The Genesis outclassed them all, so I ended up buying a V6 w/Tech Package.  The features on this car are an incredible value even though I still shudder when I think about how much higher my loan is on this car.  Great ride - kind of similar to my father's 2001 BMW 528i, but more smooth overall.  Definitely not as mushy as a Lexus, but not as punishing as a Beemer.  Great looking car, too - I've gotten a lot of rave reviews of the car's looks and disbelief when I tell them ""It's a Hyundai.""

The balance between comfort and being close to sporty is outstanding.  Car & Driver and Road & Track can gig the car for Sportiness - not all of us like the taut, firm ride of the BMW'S and Audi's. The gas mileage is better than expected, especially cruising at 75. As mentioned by many, dealer support for a luxury car needs to be better.  Hyundai does stand by there warranty. Our dealer gave us 2 years worth of oil changes and car washes, and has a very good reputation.  I would advise finding a good dealer when buying.  The value of this Luxury car is outstanding.","Stereo! Stereo! and Stereo! The ride is out of the world, and the backlit dash at night is out of this world. The warranty is outstanding, and the other Luxury Sedans can't compete in features and amenities for the price. And it fits my 6'4"" frame, something that lacks in the BMW and Mercedes.","Back seat needs to be collapsible for complete pass thru.  Cool seats on both sides.  Much needed dealer training and support to get them into the mentality of how a Luxury car should be delivered and give same aspect of value as BMW and others.

4.375,09 Genesis...my wish list,jerry ,09/02/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,4,4,No doubt the best luxury car for the money. Might trade mine in for the V* when it shows up. My wish list. Back up camera (NAV Model) needs to come on faster at start up. Genesis logo remains on the screen too long when put in reverse at start up. I have backed up 10 feet before the screen goes to back up. ,The control knob is great for navigating the XM radio. A?C drivers seat really pumps the cold air although it should remain on at start up if it was on at shut down.  ,see above. Make lane departure and active cruise control available. Maybe touch screen NAV (I don't think it is on mine?). Paint quality on bumper covers could be better (more coats). 
4.875,Incredible Value for $$$!,Propellerhead ,09/02/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Moved from 2006 Azera Ltd to this. Other cars currently owned are 2006 BMW ""M"" Roadster and 2008 Infiniti M35. Prior vehicles (since 1994) -- 1998 Mercedes SL600, Infinity Q45(2), Lexus ES(300 & 330), a 2002 Porsche Turbo, and a VW Phaeton. It is our experience that the 2009 Genesis is absolutely the best value of any of the above cars - there is NO comparison versus what Hyundai packs into this vehicle for $40K when fully loaded. We could have chosen ANY car we wanted and yet opted for this because of our prior excellent experience with the Azera and the fact that the Genesis offers far more features and performance for MUCH less money than ANY of the autos we have owned.","The fact that Genesis has managed to pack in Bluetooth, an iPod connector, a 6 CD changer and a Nav system into the same vehicle which NO other auto maker seems to have figured out how to do yet. Either you get one or another but not all. In addition, Lexus Bluetooth is a known nightmare --","Trunk on the Azera is bigger and the Azera's rear seats fold down to facilitate a large pass through. Azera's rear seat room is also much more ample. BUT, when compared to Lexus or our Infiniti, the rear seat room easily beats them all. In net, about as good as it can get at ANY price!"
5,Hyundai should be at the top of the list,Lonny ,08/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Like many others here, I too can't believe I even looked at Hyundai, let alone getting one! I began researching this car early in the year. I was coming to lease end on a 2006 M45 Sport and wanted something much less expensive, uses regular fuel and gets better gas mileage. I liked the handling dynamics of the M45 and was worried that I took a big step backwards in handling. Not so! I have found myself taking the same turns and curves in the Hyundai that I did with the M45 - at the same speeds - and the Hyundai is just as ""planted"" as was the M45. Obviously the M was quicker, but I enjoy everything about the Hyundai better.","Nice roomy interior, large trunk. A sound system (Lexicon) that you blow you out of the car. A quiet, smooth ride. I have only put about 800 miles on it and I am averaging 24 mpg! I love the navigation system and being able to play MP3's using the USB connection.","There is only one thing that I miss from the M45 that the Hyundai does not have: the ability to use the key fob to roll down all the windows as you approach the car. But, that is the ONLY thing that I miss. I certainly don't miss the higher monthly payment, higher fuel costs and lower gas mileage. "
5,Underpriced Luxury,kbmuenkel ,08/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've owned this car one month with every passing week appreciating the Genesis more and more. The technology features are plentiful and well thought out. Dollar for dollar the Genesis equipped with the Tech Package is a stunning value.  The 290hp V6 engine is more than adequate for enthusiastic driving. The Genesis handling is nicely balanced between sportiness and numbness with just enough road feel to inspire confidence and comfort. Exterior noise does not penetrate the cabin yielding a wonderfully quiet ride. The 528w 17 speaker Lexicon surround sound fills your driving experience with clear, crisp, enriching musical enjoyment. I considered 335xi, CTS4, & ES350, but bought a Genesis. Wow!","Everything about the Technology Package, quiet ride, generous interior room front and back, exterior design, roomy trunk, and most of all - the remarkable value.",Interior of the trunk is cheaply finished.  Expandable map pockets in the front doors have a sharp edge.  Passenger side seat should also have the cooling option.  Add a power console in the back with a 110v outlet to plug in a laptop or video game.  Offer a headrest DVD option.
5,Who needs a BMW 7??,mn778 ,08/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I've owned bm'ers since '89. Just had my '05 745 turned in and said goodbye! The Genesis is every bit the luxo ride. The V6 is faster than my 745 was. Every day I fall further in love with it. The tech package is great[much easier than the i Drive!] Best thing is I can buy two genesis's for the price of a loaded 7! Great Car.,,
5,Perfect!!,Little Nuke ,08/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is easily the nicest I have owned.  I traded an Acura for this and before that I had a Mercedes.  Frankly, neither of them can compare to this car.  It's superior in every way.  I love telling people I traded my Acura for a Hyundai.",Ride quality.,None yet.
4.75,Mission Accomplished!!!,imtraveler ,08/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I was following & really looking forward to this motor car, so I bought it! Owned 7 series & was nice compromise, esp. price. Hyundai's first foray with an all-new RWD platform & V8 engine in this class is impressive. My car turns heads and I love its understated execution. Has the luxury amenities I need and $$$ to spare.  Wish it was sold in a dedicated channel -- i.e., Genesis brand -- wouldn't mind stripping the H logo and replacing it with domestic market Genesis wings logo (front, back, wheel hub & horn pad)","Easy to drive, smooth, quiet and refined. Love the DIS, Lexicon audio & driver cooled seats.",Wish that the brakes were more on par with vehicles in this class (see BMW b/mark). Prefer a bit firmer handling & less body roll. Would look dynamite with some nice wheels. Agree that pass seat should be cooled as well. Need much better dealer experience & MORE advertising!! Brand needs enhancement
5,A luxurious sedan,Greensander ,08/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Lease deal was $473/Mo.   $2199 upfront. I am quite satisfied its styling and convenience.

4.75,Deja vu of 1989 Lexus debut,C in Indy ,07/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"We wanted to drive a VW Passat, Chevy Malibu, and a Genesis on the same day. Went from the VW dealer to the Hyundai and  bought the Genesis.  There was no comparison, the other cars were nice mid size family cars (both with noted nice interiors), but couldn't hold a candle to the Genesis.  The big Hyundai was quieter, smoother, and so much nicer on the inside and outside than the other two.  It really reminded me of the Lexus debut of the LS400 back in '89.  I went to that knowing that this car was supposed to be different than any other Toyota ever seen, but was blown away by how nice it really was.  Same feelings here.  My Wife is very happy with the car too.","Build quality, materials, noise level (none), ride (smooth), features (lots).",Dealer experience
5,I CAN'T BELIEVE ITS A HYUNDAI,johnnyb ,07/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I can tell you from owning a BMW, that the Hyundai Genesis is a very comparable and as high a quality as you can believe.It has great extras with the navigation and bluetooth. You can't ask for much more in a beautiful car. Great style and luxury.",love the front gill not having the flying H. ,The only bad thing that I can really complain about is the passenger seat is not cooled like the drivers. 
5,Great Car,JM ,07/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"A better car in all respects to my 06 Lincoln LS. I chose this car over Acura, MB, and Buicks I test drove. The car is a deal even at $33k-$37K for the V6 model. Black and Silver look great in this car. No cassette player- this is 2008.  I have a 2000 Elantra with over 200K miles and it has been problem free.","Looks, price, interior and seats. Leather covered dash",It needs better advertising
5,Better than I ever thought it could be!,Chris ,07/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After turning in my lease and getting bait and switched by the dealer on my Infiniti G35, I decided to test drive the Genesis, as I had followed since seeing the Super Bowl ad.  All I can say is I am so glad the folks at Infiniti BS'd me on the new payment!  I would have missed out on the best vehicle I have ever driven.  Everything from top to bottom is so well done.  If this is Hyundai's first attempt at a luxury vehicle, I can wait to see what they come up with next.  This is a $60-70K car with a $35K price tag!  ",Interior is unreal.  Sound system (Lexicon) great as well.  Love the look and the illumination at night.,Standard nav maybe?  Nothing else.
5,Hyundai won this battle.,Jose Machado ,07/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my car a couple days ago and I can tell you that this a nice car, I compared this car with the Lexus gs 350 and the Infiniti g35 and the handling, ride and quietness of this car is superior.","Quality, room, finish",back sensor with the prem. + pkg

Plenty of power but great mileage for a 3.8L.  I couldn't be happier-I've researched and waited for this car since I saw it on the Super Bowl ads.  Look out Lexus-here comes Genesis.   ",Great exterior styling and luxurious interior with lots of room.  ,Folding rear seats.
4.875,Genesis ROCKS!,impressedbo1 ,07/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,Drove the car for the first time yesterday and all I can say is WOW! Never thought driving a Hyundai could be so fun or engaging yet so relaxing and assuring. Feels more secure than any BMW I've ever driven definitely more on par with an A8 as far as structural feel. In performance driving the car has such a neutral feeling and is very balanced weather on or off the accelerator. I don't think the ESP even tried to keep the car in line it just did it on it's own. This car looks great with tight wheel well gaps (looks like it's already lowered) and sharp tight body lines. The only thing I might change is the rear tail lamps so it looks less like an Infiniti.,Technology packages is really cool don't think the car would be quite as impressive without that. Love the USB port and Ipod connectivity in the center console. This car drives perfect in my eyes if you need more power I am sure the V8 will be plenty for most anyone as I am satisfied with the V6. ,"I haven't figured out if it can play music over the blue tooth connection yet, In the winter I think headlamp washers might be helpful for us in climate zones that see bad weather. I hope that the DIS system can get updated software to keep up to date with new technology."

4,Best Hyundai,dlflyboy ,07/21/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Just took delivery on July 15th. It's a nice car. Good looks and ride. Nice features. I average 23mpg mixed driving. The car has a nice exterior design. Inside is kinda boring. Get the Lexicon sound system. You'll love it (I know I do). However, the cd changer had to be replaced (stopped working). The service department is not up to par with other luxury dealers (especially BMW). Loaners are nice when your car is in the shop for a day (the shuttle vans don't cut it). And for the amount of time I own a car (usually 3 yrs) BMW still has the best warranty. Love the standard maintenance warranty (4yr 50k). At the end of the day this is still just a Hyundai. But, overall I'm happy with the car.",Sound system,Navi missing some features the other luxos have. Better cabin. It's a little bland. And how about a front passenger cooled seat as well (and rear heated seats). Don't skimp. 
5,Giant Killer,jay   ,07/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"What a great car!!  Makes you totally rethink the brand.  The interior is a lot lot better than what the pics show in the web or in magazines.  The fit and finish is very good and the Lexicon really is AMAZING!!  I thought the steering would feel too light as a lot of bigger luxury cars tend to be, but i was pleasantly surprised...it's no sports sedan in feel but it has a good amount of resistance and good on center feel. Only gripe is the bluetooth, no wheel mounted controls and does not come through the cars existing speakers.  Go test drive one with an open mind and you will soon forget all that you thought was a Hyundai.  I give it an A.",Good overall looks inside and out.  Very comfy and roomy interior. Lexicon sound system.  Good looking wheels for a Luxury sedan.  Rear wheel drive.  Value.,"Bluetooth...no steering wheel mounted controls and does not come through audio system speakers.

This is a luxury sedan that is powerful, quiet, luxurious, attractive and priced very competitively.   Handles very well w/ a sporty ride.  Great fuel efficiency for a 3.8L V-6 engine.  The instrumentation is great and the sound system is top of the line.  I compared the Mercedes E- Class, Lexus 350, Jaguar XF, Infiniti M-35/45 and BMW 5 Series before I chose this vehicle.
