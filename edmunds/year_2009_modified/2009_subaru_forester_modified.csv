4,Ruby the Subaru,Greg ,11/12/2016,4,3,4,,,4,5,4,5,,,"Great little SUV, I purchased at 92,000 miles and immediately had to do a tune up, head gaskets, brakes, drive belts, thermostat, battery, and power steering pump. I would have sold it once I figured out everything that was wrong but the mechanic said that the vehicle would be good for at least another 100,000 miles now and that these are normal Subaru issues. It's very comfortable, it drives great and holds the road better than anything I have ever owned. Keep your fingers crossed that the mechanic is right, I didn't expect to pay such a high resale amount and have to put that many repairs in within the first three months of ownership.",,

I really have no complaints of a seriuos nature. the sound of the opposed 4 cyl motor with it's 4 spped automatic is less than inspiring but that's a minor thing. the fuel economy has been around 23 mpg around town and i suppose it could be better, but everything else has been so cheap to fix that I really don't mind it.

They told me the short block needed to be replaced, and quoted me almost $5,000 for the repair. When I asked about a trade in or what my options were they asked me if I had driven the car without oil in it or something! I doubt they would have asked my husband if we had driven the car without oil in it. We have taken good care of maintaining the car, that is how we noticed that it was using way more oil than it should. They told me that without the repair it would only trade in for $3,500. I told them we needed time to make a decision and they did give us their loaner car for the weekend which was nice. When I returned the loaner car they said they would split the repair cost, they pay 70% I pay 30%. I did some research and found several other reviews of 2008-2009 Forester's needing the short block replaced. I plan to fix it then trade it in before anything else goes wrong.",,

2,Bad Subaru Story,pick417 ,07/05/2015,2,2,2,,,2,3,2,3,,,"This past April, I purchased a 2009 Subaru Forester from Byers Subaru, Dublin OH and eagerly anticipated the ownership experience Subaru promises and proudly bases its reputation.  Contrary to the Subaru promise, my experience over the first 3 months has been a nightmare.  The first service was performed within a few weeks of purchase ($700).  A month later the vehicle stopped running and required a tow to a Subaru dealership.   Initial thoughts were a timing belt failure.  $600 dollars later, we learned it was a timing belt pulley failure and would require extensive engine repairs or an engine replacement ($2500 to $6000).   The timing belt was not due to be replaced for 10,000 miles.   Continuing saga .....check engine light came on.....traced to faulty brake booster 300.00 repair cost.  Does this kinda of crap ever end?  Subaru is selling the public snake oil regarding how reliable their cars are!!",,

The transmission in this Forester is jerky & extremely rough. I have records from the previous owner, and it was babied and taken care of very well. I maintain this car as well as I can, and I just hope that it will last another five years. The engine pings horribly while running up through the gears.

I loved it the moment I saw it, but dreaded the notch-y first gear. For being a younger male driver, I want something practical and safe, yet fun but wanted some comfort for occasional long drives and never could find a car i liked that didn't cause minor back aches even on a short test drive, except for this one.

If only it had a few more inches of trunk space and more factory stereo options as the 80w preamp is barely enough for the 4 main, let alone the opt 6 speaker set, and I've read the NAVI is not at all user-friendly","My partner and I love to go soft-roading on hidden dirt trails and its perfect to explore

The Panoramic sunroof is beautiful for stargazing

Sharp breaks, good road manners

Great all-round driver visibility

Decent MPG with 5M and easy driving

Who thought it'd be smart to get rid of a temperature gauge and replace it with a tiny light that you can barely see when it ""warns"" you that it is about to overheat?

I'm not tall (5'10""), but every once in a while, when getting in the front seat I'll end up hitting my knee on the corner of the dash because of its bowed design

3.25,Three years of ownership,jassdsu ,02/20/2013,,,2,4,2,3,,4,3,3,5,"I recently sold my 2009 XT Forester.When I bought the subaru I was passionate about it like most Subaru owners.Love- thats what makes a Subaru rightWe recently sold the car after owning it for three plus years.Likes- the sleek design, fun to drive.Dislike- poor MPG, small fuel tank, and overall carrying capacity.With the Turbo model you have the same size fuel tank as the regular non turbo- the problem is your mpg is only 22 to 23 mpg,Im not sure what the size of the tank is but its insufficient and requires filling up on aregular basis. Road trips would require extra stops to get gas- Im not exaggerating- its a real design problem.The panels on the outside of the car ","are pretty flimsy.
My wife dented one by closing the door with her foot. I would equate the cargo capacity to that of a Sedan but the problem is you get the MPG of a truck.
Price wise the MPG of truck atleast.
Let me explain. With the turbo not only do you get low MPG but you have to pour Premium fuel into it otherwise you get an engine knock.
In other words the cost to drive this vehicle is equivalent to a truck when you take into account the low MPG and price of premium fuel.
Heres
another issue.
With the XT you have to change the oil every 3,000 miles otherwise youll
have performance issue.
What happens, the heads get clogged not sure what the means, it shuts down power to the ","motor- it sounds horrible.
I once went 5,000 miles and had performance problems as described so I took it to a mechanic and for $100 he told me I needed an oil change.
This happened twice and I dont neglect my cars as one may think. A car should be able to go 5,000 miles between oil changes. So all you house moms that forget to change your oil- this isnt the car for you.
Dont plan on putting three kids in the back either- its too narrow and they will kill each other. Most SUVs are wider than this forester. Lastly what put me over the edge was a recent trip to the mountains, we were on a dirt road with an inch of slushy snow.
We attempted to turn around and got stuck.

The console is simple and easy to see.
The large sunroof is a nice bonus.

As though it's in idle and I'm revving the engine.  Corrects itself when I back off of the accelerator. Am not in control of the speed of the vehicle when this happens.

But after extensive review online and test driving it and my other top choices (CR-V and RAV4) I came to a decision that the Forester was the optimal choice to suit my needs. It provided everything I wanted in a SUV- reliability, fuel efficiency, AWD, reasonable cost and reasonable comfort level (leather seats and heating, 6 disc changer stereo system to mention a few). My vehicle has handled well in the sub- artic condition in which I drive it. I have slipped a few times this winter but my vehicle handled well (those experiences have reminded me that technology is no substitute for sensible driving)",I feel the stereo system is pretty decent.

It has been eight days since we met with the Subaru rep and while he agrees that the transmission is not right, the dealership has still not called; how lovely. Very poor performance in the mountains on a recent trip and the door skins are very thin.",The highway ride is acceptable and the all wheel drive system is impeccable. ,A modern transmission with five or six gears would help performance and mileage.

The exterior is great but the interior is cheap & poorly designed. The fabric on the doors already looks worn, the electric seats crack the plastic covers around the legs every time I move the seat back, the rubber seal around the back passenger door fell off... The position of the seat heater knobs is unreachable while driving.  Plus, my factory installed remote start doesn't work unless the car is already warmed up.  The dealership says there have been other complaints about this happening but nothing is being done to fix it. Subaru customer service is terrible. Don't buy this car!!","The big sunroof is nice but it doesn't ""pop"" open & if you drive in wind the sound can be deafening. ",Use leather on the door trims if the seats are leather - like my '07 legacy. Reposition the buttons for the seat heaters. Get customer service that actually serves your customers!!!!!

The Forester has a better build and a symmetric AWD that is untouched in the automotive world.  Plus, I got a lot more car from my money.  It is fun to drive, handles beautifully (especially in the snow), and has plenty of room but you don't feel like you're driving a bus.  And it does come with heated cloth seats and a front license plate mount--I have them both!  The cup holders are fine, too, and there are eight of them.  Not sure what people are complaining about...","Heated cloth seats, huge moonroof, back seats that fold completely down in one shot, lots of head room.",Stereo sound isn't the greatest and a release for the rear gate would be nice.

4.625,Wow What an Amazing Turbo,Neil ,03/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"Just purchased 09 turbo - forget the base - way underpowered, awful stereo. The turbo is a blast to drive, no lag at all! Punches holes in traffic. Amazing tight feel, great turning radius, better stereo - still not the greatest but not bad, perfect dog/hiking car. The best car for the rain - Seattle gets just a little rain - haha. Overall a really huge improvement over the last Forester and looks so much better, a very attractive car. Do not bother with the limited 3 grand for leather - Major rip off. Get the base turbo and be happy!","Turbo, handling, nice ride, blue color, better hood scoop, well executed interior. Fun to drive!",Mileage is avg. 17-could be better. Reg. gas would be nice.

I've now owned the vehicle for 1 year/11,000 miles, so here is an update.  I still really enjoy this car! The AWD was so amazing in the Pacific NW storms this winter, that I bought another Forester for my girlfriend.  Only major disappointment is with the thickness/quality of the exterior sheetmetal/paint. It seems to be lower quality & less durable than other SUV's I've owned. My early production model had undersized plastic film fender protectors, so paint chipped and fenders now need to be repaired & repainted.","Favorites features are the AWD, M/T, huge sunroof, ipod i/f, great fuel economy (26-28 mpg around town), safety features, rear visibility, easy fold down rear seats, great cargo capacity.

Yes I do have a slight rattle related to the sunroof cover on the inside of car. Not a big deal. Options I bought, tweeter, woofer, IPod connection, fog lights, all weather mats, cargo tray, rear spoiler, hood protector, rugged package (You should buy the rugged package). Handles great on slick streets. Have had to break under emergency condition one time and handling and breaks worked well. Acceleration is very adequate for my driving style. Right now MPG is holding at 22. I have shown this car to many friends who all like it, some of whom had given me a hard time over the type of car.","The huge sunroof is great. The styling is very nice. I really like the stance of the car, high ground clearance. Newport Blue is a great color. I Pod connection is a nice feature. So far very happy with everything. Fun to drive.","At this point he only thing I would change is the the seat heat controls. They are too far back on the center console. Minor issue however.

2.5,dont buy xt,bad experience ,02/16/2009,,,3,3,1,1,,3,3,3,3,The engine on this car (turbo) blew up in a remote location late at night in a snow storm.  We had kids in the car. BAD experience.  Totally unacceptable for a car with 9600 miles on it.  Subaru paid for the rental car for the time my car was at the dealer; plus got them to pay me $1000 for my hassle and pay for free scheduled maintenance on the car for the rest of the lease term.  I was told by dealer that turbo engines have an oil piping problem.  The turbo gets starved of oil.  The result is mechanical failure of turbo. Metal pieces somehow get into engine.  Bye-bye engine.,Overall package is not bad.  Gas mileage better than my old suv. Lots of space.,Better quality control by Subaru (how about a functioning engine). improved stereo.

Comfortable ride, great on snowy roads but the factory tires will need to be replaced eventually with more wintry all-season tires. The factory ones are really better suited for dry pavement, in my opinion. When I picked this car I primarily liked the cabin size and volume. I felt I was getting better value over the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CRV (and can't stand rear-door mounted spare tire!).  Radio has nice features but sound quality is only fair.  Comfortable ride. Combined city/hwy is 22.5 MPG in this hilly area. Only 1700 miles on car at this point. So far, a real pleasure to drive and own.  ","Love all the room. Reminds me of my old Jeep Cherokee: square and boxy (but a much better ride and gas mileage!). Rear seat passengers have adequate leg and headroom.  When back seats are folded down, they actually fold completely level with cargo floor.  Like both the interior and exterior styling.",Need a 5-speed automatic transmission.

I can't say anything bad about it and with the snow that we have had in the midwest this winter, I am very impressed by how well it handles deep snow.  I have owned several Jeeps and it is every bit as good in the snow as any Jeep I have ever owned, but with much better fuel economy.  This is the best suv bargain out there.","Great build quality, ergonomics and fit an finish.

Yes it can. 4 adults and luggage cruising at 120 km/hr without any effort. For the price the Forester is the best value in a 4 wheel drive SUV.

In town driving normal which is like everyone else being somewhat aggressive our XT will get 19 MPG, baby it at the lights and corners and 22 MPG is possible.  Needless to say we get 19 MPG most of the time.  Highway at 75 MPH steady, it gets 23 MPG.  Side roads at 55 MPH to 65 MPH we can get 25 MPG reliably.   Recently we took a 160 mile trip up into the mountains.  For anyone from N. Colorado, we drove from Greeley to Lyons, up highway 7 to Allens Park, then to Estes and then to Fort Collins.  Nearly a 4000 ft gain but we drove conservatively near the speed limits and got 26.1 MPG.  Never lacked power.","Handling, ride, AWD, leather seats, sunroof.

Drove vehicle in a few recent snowfalls, and car handled great with exc. traction.

I am a big guy and find the drivers seat comfortable and the interior controls within easy reach except for the heated seat switches. It performs well in the snow in Vermont with the standard tires and the gas mileage has been a steady 24 to 25 mpg with lots of hwy driving. The passenger seat is strange to get used to with it being so low. There is a rattle in the moonroof mechanism that needs attention and the road noise is loud compared to our Camry.",The moonroof and mileage are our two favorites. The heated seats are a nice touch as well as the heated wiper area that melts the accumulated snow and ice in a storm.,Radio speakers need help. The auto transmission could use another gear and it helps to have owned a VW Beetle in the early years to get used to the lack of power off of this engine.

Since they are new, it will be a minimum of 2 weeks to maybe get an engine delivered, probably a month.  I owned 3 outbacks and loved them, but this is unacceptable.

Hood scoop and chrome like pedals and foot rest are a little kiddish on a Forester. People looking at Forester would want power passenger seat more. Good handling for SUV, seems nimble.

The radio has poor reception and Subaru keeps telling us that it is a setting that needs to be changed on the radio itself, Unfortunately that is not the problem. When you fade just to the rear speakers the radio barely comes in at all and the reception is poor on any setting. The rim design on the 2.5X Limited is also poor the vehicle is sold as an all wheel drive for snow and other types of bad driving conditions, however when it snows more than 4"" snow gets in the inner part of the rim and freezes over night causing the vehicle to shake excessively at 40 plus mph.

The dealership installed an electronic start and I believe they have messed up the electrical system as nothings seems quite right. What about the mileage.  I am seeing 15-18 and I now have 4000 miles on this vehicle and am NOT speeding. I left my keys in the car and turned OFF yet in less than 3 hours my car battery was totally DEAD.  This certainly can't be a safety feature to have a battery lose charge this quickly.  I agree about the noise!,I do have some favorite features which is why I bought it. Our winter has been snowy and icy and the car is wonderful for both. I love the exterior look.,"See my review - add to that a cheap radio, cheap plastic, and cheap coffee holders.

However, the lack of lumbar support and position of the head rests do make this somewhat uncomfortable. They take some getting use to. (My petite wife complains even more than I do.) The console holds my travel mug just fine.  The biggest plus for this is the sure-footedness I encountered in snow/icy conditions.  The AWD really grips, and the handling is very responsive.  I bought the manual because that's what I enjoy driving and wanted to get the better gas mileage. The throw into 5th is a bit of a reach.  The first four gears are fine and smooth. Gas mileage 26.4 overall. Traveling over 65 brings MPG down quickly.",Handling is great--especially in snow. The exterior is very attractive. The heated cloth seats are very nice on a cold morning. Easy to get in and out of this vehicle. ,"Adding lumbar support for the driver would be very appreciated. The location of the switch for heated seat is awkward.

The ride is smooth, cabin noise is low if you remove the rack crossbars.  The turbo really adds to the experience once you get used to the surge as it kicks in.  Effortlessly cruises at 75 MPH.  The AWD is sure footed and the heated wipers, mirrors, and seats are wonderful during the CO winters.  Actual mileage is good, 22 around town, 25 on the highway though if you drive aggressively in town you can easily drop the city mileage to mid- teens.  It's a turbo after all.   Coming from a Volvo S60 AWD, I find the Forester similiar in many ways.  Well maybe not the dash materials but it's just fine, I didn't pay S60 prices.","Handling, ride, power, mileage, and many of the standard luxury items.

This causes a number of people to have severe headaches and back pain after an average commute.  In addition, there are NO cupholders in this vehicle. Subaru does not want a Subaru owner to drink fluids while they drive the vehicle... this according to Subaru corporate. The transmission is tough to get into reverse about 30% of the time. Experience with other makes and models indicates that transmissions that are difficult to put into reverse when new, are maintenance headaches later on.

It chips and flakes off with hardly any contact. In addition, I am very disappointed in the ""carpet"", which appears to be more of a felt material. Absolutely everything sticks to it and it doesn't vacuum up well at all. I didn't do an in depth inspection of the carpet and such at the time I bought it, as I expected more from a Subaru. Other than these interior issues, it's great. I'm guessing you just have to buy the upper end styles to get a decent interior. ","Ride, reputation","Don't use that horrible felt carpet stuff!

The only ""problem"" that I've had thus far is the paint on the plastic in the interior doesn't stick to the plastic.  The paint literally wore off of the driver's door handle from my knee resting on it while driving! This occurred only after 3 months of ownership.  The dealership immediately ordered a new door handle and handled the issue w/ the utmost professionalism.  Problem is, when the car is out of warranty, I'm stuck w/ the problem.

2.625,More Uncomfortable Seats of any car,usererrr ,08/11/2008,,,1,4,2,3,,4,1,3,3,"We were so excited about getting the Forester - great headroom, legroom. We purchased it yesterday and went for our first day trip today.  THE SEATS ARE SO SO SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I stopped at one point to lay out on a picnic table at a park along the road. Zero lumbar support...goofy headrest pointed the wrong way, and knees higher than your rump - all the pressure goes to your low back.  I am absolutely so so sad I'm stuck with such miserable seats in what seems to be a nice (otherwise) car.  I'm young, not overweight, and in good health - and these seats are absolutely awful.",head room leg room cargo,"seats, seats, seats"

The new Subie is a pleasant driving experience!  The turbo provides a distinct but not overpowering reminder that this Forester is no longer a narcoleptic Sunday drive with Aunt Millie and Uncle Olaf.    Plenty of room.  I'm 6-2, and there's still headroom.  Our 2 boys like the moon-roof.  The 09 Forester is wider, longer, and taller, making it larger than other ""small"" SUVs, and very close to what I expect from mid-SUVs   I have to laugh - the coffee-cup holder is still flimsy and cheap looking  - just like in all Subarus, including our '99 Sub Outback wagon. ","Basically, the new 2009 Forrester has everything I can get from  mid-sized SUV, incl (with the turbo), a horsepower-to weight ratio that makes this a LOT more fun to drive.  And, unlike the mid-sized SUVs, the Forester mileage is avg 25 city/hwy.  I love the ""puddle lights"" & backlit blue dash.","What is it with the coffee holders?  The other center console beverage holder is square (square ??!).  What beverage containers are square??  That is really the only quirk.  Don't get the nav.  If you want nav, just buy it aftermarket."

4.875,Love this Car,Subaru Convert ,08/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I researched all of the good gas mileage SUVs and test drove the Toyota Highlander, Nissan Murano, Honda CRV, and Toyota RAV4.  The Subaru Forester was my favorite.  I have 2000 miles on it so far and I am extremely pleased.  The Turbo is very fast with no lag on the highway and some lag from standing stops.  The ride is smooth and the handling is car like.  Cargo storage is great with many different tie down options.  The interior controls are very simple.  The gas mileage is better than I thought.  I am getting 27 mpg on the highway with speeds 65 MPH or under.  The gas mileage goes down to 24 mpg at highway speeds of 75 mph. I love the tight turning circle. Very little road noise","Simple controls, large sun roof, fun turbo, car like handling, smooth ride, low road noise, 6 foot cargo bed.","Standard satellite radio with subwoofer, digital climate control, power window control after engine is turned off, combination key/key fob"

As for the Forester, visibility is amazing.The handling is great. Very car-like and corners well with the stability control. I'm getting 26 MPG average so far. You can't beat that for an AWD SUV. The sunroof is huge! My biggest complaint so far is on the highway I was behind an 18 wheeler and I was pulled a bit from the wind difference. But that's it. I love this car and I am very happy with it.","Sunroof and the brightness inside the vehicle from it, car-like handling, gas mileage, exterior and interior styling, plenty of room, safety features, Subaru AWD, reclining back seats, excellent quality for cloth seats, Subaru customer service.","Better stereo system, fixing the movement from being behind large trucks. (I think that has to do with the exterior design?) Other than that, nothing. Great car!"

Arm rest are very low on left side, unsecure on right side. Would love better seat adjustments. Move panic button from back of key to front, I always seem to hit it when I'm unlocking the hatch. It is fun to drive. Road noise is pretty loud at hwy speed. Love the room!  Much better than others  After test driving almost everything, Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4, MBenz Mclass, Acura, this was the best choice.  The Acura has more comfortable seats and armrest for tall people like me, but cost $15K more.  Just couldn't justify.

Love this car, Except for the extremely hard seats (leather).  Test drive was short and sweet so we didn't notice how uncomfortable they were.  I have severe back trouble and this has put me in a horrible flare-up, after only driving 6 miles home from the dealership.  Called the following morning and told of medical situation, and could we please bring the car back as I will have to stay with a mini-van.  They would buy the car back at at $7000 loss (pretty steep for 6 miles). So, we are having the seats rebuilt, if this is of no help, then the car will have to go.  Please beware of seat comfort.","Turbo - wow. Love the size, handling, visibility and color. Safety features are exceptional.  ","Please make comfortable seats, not everyone is in perfect condition!  Arms rests would be helpful.  Otherwise seems like a great vehicle "

This car handles beautifully and is a joy to drive. It has more room than the previus model yet maintains the Forester image. Gas mileage has been as high as 32 highway at 60 mph. Fit and finish is excellent. I am thrilled with my new 2009 Forester. Would recommend the Rugged Package which includes side moldings, fender moldings, roof rack bars and rear bumper protector.","This car is a joy to drive. Fit and finish is excellent. Car is roomy and comfortable. So far, legend Subaru dependability is evident. I love the style of the 2009 model.",There is an intermitent rattle coming from the right dash.

I have had mine for a month and recently took it on it's first interstate trip. The ride quality was poor at best - deafening road noise where 2 of us in the front seats had to shout at each other constantly in addition to picking up every tar crack or road imperfection.  Also exhibited wind noise at 55 MPH.  As for the performance, the little 4 cylinder was constantly shifting and loud with every little grade we encountered. I'm not talking about hills here. Maybe its the cheap Yokohama tires or they forgot to put insulation in mine.  My 05 Merc Mountaineer on a truck frame was better.",Gas mileage is the only thing I'd say is good.  ,"Ride, road noise, higher height adjuster for driver seat, mushy brakes, wind noise, another gear for tranny, Cheap plastic tie down hooks that would snap off with any appreciable weight."

We were comparing between a CRV exl a BMW x3 and a lr2.  The Forester handled the best, had the most options for the most reasonable lease price and our sales rep at irvine Subaru was second to none.

5,Best All Around Vehicle!!!!,rwilcauskas ,07/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"  Recently traded in our 1997 Ford Explorer due to age and recent repairs. Researched all vehicles in the compact/midsized SUV Class.  Drove the Nissan Rogue ,Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4.  Then drove the Forester.   The Forester has an exceptional amount of cargo and passenger room for a ""small"" SUV.  The vehicle handles great due to standard all-wheel drive.  We did have leather installed because the only drawback was the cloth seats did not feel very comfortable.  I would highly recommend this vehicle because of the great gas mileage (27 > on highway, and 26 combined) and the multitude of safety features. The Swiss Army Knife of all vehicles! Great value, performance, and reliability!","All-wheel drive, keyless entry, leather (installed by dealer because LL Bean was discontinued), fog lights, radio with text feature (teenagers loved), GREAT GAS MILEAGE, storage room.","Drive seat can be adjusted up and down, suggest the same for the passenger. Would be nice if doors would auto lock after you go over 15 mph. Fog lights should be standard. Cloth seats could be a little more supportive."

4.75,Best small SUV out there now!,Luis ,07/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"We've had small SUVs/CUVs since the first ones came onto the scene. This time it was between newest CR-V, Outlander, or Forester. Didn't like weird styling which sacrificed utility/visibility on new CR-V, couldn't find right color/options/price combo on Outlander, but we instantly loved the simple, stylish, and useful design of the new Forester. Even in ""base"" trim, has the features you need and many you'll want -- all at a great price. Peppier with manual shift, and improved in every way. Great interior room and visibility, nice style inside and out. More mainstream than ever, but better for it!","Simple, elegant style and controls, all safety features standard (VDC, traction control, all airbags, ABS, etc), great interior room and visibility, smooth ride, nice mainstream styling inside and out, best MPG and AWD in its class.","A few nits: would like adjustable rear seatbacks on base model and nicer standard steel wheels.

4.5,Another Subaru for us!,Erik and Kelley ,07/22/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,4,4,"I just took possession of a 2009 Subaru Limited edition (non turbo).  The interior space is far superior to my 2001 Subaru Forester.  The ""fit and finish"" are a step up--still a little plastic, though.  Engine is adequate to good, with some pep (but not extra- ordinary speed or handling).  Nearly bought a Toyota V-6 Rav 4 which drove a little better, but the extra cost (nearly 3000 dollars) and the smaller interior for me (I am over 6 feet tall) made the Subaru the choice.  Looking for 8-10 good years from this vehicle, a good choice for a safe, reliable, practical car that drives quite well in the snow and can handle two small kids and one dog.  See you in the mountains of West Virginia!","Interior vastly improved on vehicle.  Moonroof a big hit with the kids.  Driver controls improved and still familiar.  Great visibility and a lot of headroom for taller drivers.  Comfortable seats and the leather feels like it is good quality.  Not as boxy/quirky as the older model, better rounded.","Biggest weakness still the engine-- would prefer a V-6 than a turbo requiring premium fuel!  Sorry to lose full size spare tire and plastic protector scoop that fit under the engine that kept road gunk out.

Went to the Subie dealer about three months ago, test drove all the above after my Subie dealer visit and measured price per feature, performance,safety, durability and cost(overall value). Each time the Subaru Forester XT Limited came back to the top and I went to drive again. Having owned several in Colorado, and took them all over 200K this Newport Blue Pearl became an easy choice with Consumer Reports recommended list pushing me along. The Turbo is not push you in the back of the seat turbo, just an ""oh my gosh"" I am at 60mph already turbo. Traded my Honda in for it and never looked back. ","Seats very comfortable-HEAD ROOM YEA!

And just 2600 miles on it, on a long road trip, the cruise control just stopped working, the ""cruise control"" warning light started blinking, the ""traction control OFF"" light came on, and the ""check engine light"" came on - can't bring in until next week - heaven knows what is going on - still had 300 miles to get home with car loaded with kids and gear.","Loved the safety features until they just turned off - thank goodness it wasn't rain or snow.  Love the looks, the size, the crash ratings.","Auto down window but no auto up.  Difficult ""valet"" on/off - alarm goes off if you open with the special key - have to use the remote only.

My wife and I traveled from Columbus, OH to Cleveland, OH (140 miles), with luggage and the A/C on, this past weekend, and averaged 29.1 mpg!  We picked up my in-laws and their luggage and drove to Rome, NY, (an additional 370 miles) again with the A/C on, and for that portion of the trip, as well as the return trip, we averaged 28.2 mpg's! Now you know why I'm ecstatic - this Forester isn't even broken in, and it's getting excellent fuel efficiency.  By the way, our Subaru is a PZEV (partial zero emissions vehicle).","Instrument panel; large rear-view vision; storage capacity; and, of course the huge moonroof!!!","Lumbar support in the seats; a higher left arm-rest; and, a more substantial middle console arm-rest.  All of these creature comforts would've helped tremendously during the nine hour trip.  A bonus item would be to add an indicator for the remaining range of miles based upon the fuel in the tank."

The utility of this vehicle is incredible and its most important function. The vehicle rides, drives, operates great. I have averaged no less than 28 mpg in mixed driving (50/50). I would recommend anyone needing something more than a car, but less than a giant SUV take a look! The turbo would have been nice, but out of my $ range, and sacrificing efficiency may not have been worth the performance - I can buy a motorcycle for those days. That said the non-turbo does great!","Sunroof, hill-assist, reclining back seats, efficiency for an SUV (albeit a small one), basically the vehicle.","The only thing that I find annoying is the driver's power window is not automatic when rolling up, but that is nit-picking a great vehicle."

4.875,Subaru is a GREAT car,Rob ,07/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is my second Forester. I have loved the 2004 XS all-wheel drive, 4-disc brakes, the feel of quality, maneuverability, crash test safety, and practicality of a hatchback to haul or carrying stuff. (I love the XT, but it uses premium gas, so I avoided it in both cars). The 2009 is more elegant, taller, more room, adds the new ""VDC"" rollover safety feature, has the SportShift autoshifter, better visibility, more airbag protection,and still has that Subaru quality. I have owned Toyotas, Hondas, Nissans, and VWs, but my Subarus just can't be beat. They hug the road and can handle diverse weather conditions. I feel safe. I love to drive them. Glad I bought them. Great cars. Love them both.","I like the Subaru all-wheel drive system, the boxer engine, the sportshifter, and the new ""VDC""- vehicle dynamics control that helps the vehicle from going out of control and flipping. I've always felt safe in my Subaru. It has great visibility. It hugs the road, stops quickly, does everything well.","The placement of the mirror controls on the dash are inconvenient. The passenger seat needs a height adjustment. The visual readings on the dash are too small for my eyes to see in daylight, but is better at night. Car needs more ""manly"" appearance so my wife will finally let me drive it. Lol... "

At the time, I tried to talk my husband into the Forester, but he really wanted the Impreza. As soon as we saw the new design though, he was sold. We absolutely love it! We went on a short road trip with my Mom and our Border Collie, Abby and it was the most comfortable drive I've ever had. There is so much space inside. I was truly surprised at how roomy it is. There is plenty of cargo space as well. We have the Premium Package with the roof rails, tinted windows, etc and it was definitely worth the extra money. I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking for the convenience of an SUV, but the driving comfort of a sedan. ","Roomy interior. Pre-wired for satellite radio. Very smooth drive, bumps feel like nothing. 3 DC outlets, including one in the cargo area which was great for our plug in cooler. Auxiliary port for mp3 player. Very quiet, virtually no road noise.

Only disappointment is the passenger's seat, very very low and not adjustable for height. Wife can barely see out! Fun to drive, feels solid, great viability in all directions.  Great safety and best AWD around.  Warning: Check your tire pressure after delivery from dealer. Many, including myself, have found the tires seriously overinflated (46 psi).

We had just been in a bad accident (totaled our car) and we were impressed with how easy it was to get in and out of the Forester. We prefer a manual shift as we live in the  mountains and have been impressed with the mileage. We are pretty much averaging 30 mpg! We have 1800 miles on the car. We've only taken 2 long trips on the highway and we even hit 32 mpg at times on those.  The car is a little underpowered, we have to downshift to get up some of the hills when we didn't have to downshift in our VW Jetta.  There is a LOT of room inside, especially leg room.

If you are thinking about this car run to your dealer, test drive it an pick your options. I was lucky enough to find a manual base model with the PZEV option. Without boring you with the technical details the bottom line is that the emissions from this car are almost the same as a Hybrid and only costs a few hundred dollars more. I have been averaging 28 MPG doing serious mountain driving. Up and down passes dirt roads etc. It handles everything effortlessly. So save the extra 10 grand and buy a Forester PZEV.

Turbo hits hard from like 2500RPM-5000RPM, which is more than necessary for normal driving. Yeah, it could use a 5th gear because the high RPMs feel dead, but it's really not necessary. It goes fast enough. Tiptronic is nice. Your mileage will top out at about actually 27mpg for 100% highway driving, no AC and windows open at a constant speed of 60MPH (2100RPM).  The XT WILL embarrass any other 4- cylinder car (with the exception of the really high end ones) and it will most certainly keep up with the 6's and 8's.  Adequate trunk space. 5 star crash rating.","Acceleration, interior space, sound system on the XT and the limited versions, huge sunroof, sports grille, illuminated interior at night (blue LED), puddle lights, feels much more upscale than the Rav-4.

Great room and space for me and my family and seems to have more room than the Liberty in some spots.  Ride is comfortable. Steering and acceleration is quick and sporty.

The '09 has a quieter highway ride and much improved interior room, both front and back. It has a slightly higher stance which makes it easier to get in and out of as well as improved visibility in traffic. It has a sportier looking dashboard -- I like the blue gauges. Clutch and transmission  have a much smoother feel, and the Incline Start Assist is a big improvement over the old hill-holder function. The double wish bone rear suspension gives slightly better handling and a much smoother ride in most road conditions.

The 4 cylinder has more than adequate acceleration but lacks a little on the highway. The quality, fit, and comfort are superb.

It's fun to drive, very capable in the snow, OK off the pavement, and has good fuel economy. The cabin is comfortable and very roomy for a small vehicle. Fit and finish is excellent.

The AWD and turning radius are great. One minor thing, you can feel a noticeable delay when it goes from a lower gear to a higher one sometimes. Overall, the ride has been great, especially on inclines, where new Forester truly separates itself from 2008 CRV. The interior is good, although I wanted a LL beans, but for the price, I have no regrets. The exterior looks much better than CRV and RAV-4.

5,Another 1st time Subaru owner,Fanatical ,03/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After many comparisons, the Forester sold me on build quality, performance, gas mileage and amenities.  This is the perfect fit! I tow a small boat, venture off road a bit and have to deal with the winters of New England. The seats are oh so comfy! I feel as if the vehicle were built around me. I'm 6' 200 lbs and there's no bumping of the elbows, loads of open air above and tons of cargo room for the family. Handling is nimble and easy, the quiet cabin is a pure joy. The other impressive feature is the view, no blind spots, easy to back a trailer, the front view is panoramic! Absolutely love the suspension, not too hard or soft, easy to park, cruises with ease.  Gas mileage is right on!","Rockford Fosgate stereo, iPod connect, huge beautiful moonroof! Those lovely leather seats and heaters.",Make the top liftgate glass a separate opening from the tailgate.

More mainstream look. More SUV then jacked-up wagon now.",Seat are comfortable Subaru AWD is the best Tons of airbags Roomy Great visability while driving ,Sound system is a bit weak Needs splash guards on the back of wheels.

4,A good update for Forester,kurtamaxxguy ,03/25/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,3,5,"For '09 Subaru showed it listened to its customers and Endowed the '09 Forester with many enhancements improving functionality, drivability and all around usefulness. The ride and handling match that of many Euros (which would be helpless on roads the Forester devours), and the interior flexibility make it roomy and versatile.  The interior shows budget limitations w/ hard plastics, etc., but is better than before and NVH is substantially reduced.  If you value functionality over style, the Forester outdoes its CSUV competition by a wide margin!","Rides/Handles like good Euro, ample ground clearance, responsive turbo, comfortable seats, loads of room in back for passengers, AWD, good build quality. ","Hard plastic trim, mouse fuzz headliner, flimsy center console, Premium gas required, some badly fitting trim."

4.625,If you want functionality over style,Bvanity2010 ,03/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,3,5,4,"I bought this car on 3/17/08 and I have been plesently suprised. I purchased the 2.5X Limited. I love the navigation and the materials. I looked at the version with a sunroof, I liked it but, with the sunroof it greatly reduced the head room.","Color, features, navigation system, materials.",A smoother ride would be nice.

5,1st time Subie owner,LuvMySubie ,03/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought one of the first 2009 Foresters off the boat. This is my 1st time owning a Subaru. So far (2 weeks, 500 miles) I love the car! Good looks (topaz gold), adequate power (5 speed manual shifts tight & smooth), quiet in the cabin, and great MPG (28+). The moonroof is huge. The build quality (espcly for a new model) is flawless. The IPOD i/f is great. And having AWD with the VDC feature is great in snow. Safety features are lengthy & very impressive. Price was competitive. And resale should be great down the road. My only complaints so far are that the HVAC blower is a little noisier than it should be, and the [variable assist] steering feels a bit too light when driving slow.",5 speed manual xmission; big moonroof; gas mileage; Ipod i/f; steering wheel mounted controls; AWD w/ VDC; reclining rear seats; lots of safety features; engine power; tinted windows;,Redesign HVAC blower motor/ducts to be less noisy; reduce a tiny bit the power steering assist at slow speeds;

5,Best SUV on the Market Today!,DMorris ,03/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I owned a 2004 Subaru Forester and then a 2007 Subaru Legacy Sedan Limited.  This new Forester has everything and more!  Great comfort, handling, performance and pickup!  ",Matches all other SUV's in size now. With the Symmetrical AWD it is number #1!,"The only thing I could think of is that Subaru could come up with a manual LL Bean or XT and the interior only comes in 2 colors, other than that it is a great SUV!"
