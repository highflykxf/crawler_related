5,Ford Escape Hybrid Engineers made America proud,nemakv ,08/11/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,"After 6,000 mi driving on top of the acquired 50,700 mi I can report exceeding the EPA reported mileage of 31 mpg, respectively I did 35 mpg on Hwy and higher for city driving. Trips from the resident up on the hill down to the city the hybrid SUV registered 49-100 mpg depends whether I did so called ""hypermiling"" (light on the gas when starting from stop, coasting, keeping the speed just below 40 mph, etc), or usual driving. Impressive right. When had mainly a flat city driving trips I exceeded 40 mpg easily, while combining with driving up the hill - 34-35 mpg. Of course, 2009-2012 model year (2d and last generation of Ford Escape Hybrid before discontinued) compared to the same model years of Toyota Highlander's hybrid, or Lexus hybrid SUV (the only market competition) is not as refined as ride, road noise, interior design even in highest trim - Limited I have. And this is surprisingly disappointing for the highest Escape Hybrid trim. Ford engineers did a great job in uniqly calibrating the hybrid SUV compared to 2d generation Toyota hybrid using the most powerful high-voltage NiMH batteries and two el. Motors. And in the same time Ford was so cheap in the rest of the hardware and interior materials, insulation from the road noise even in Escape Hybrid Highest and more expensive Limited trim??Too bad Ford engineers made America proud with the only utility plus fuel economy SUV that Toyota was not able to match by calibrating the hybrid engine to work only on electrical power in certain circumstances, while Ford managers discontinued this unique and most reliable Ford vehicle for 2013 model year. Ask New York police and city taxi, also San Francisco taxi service, which retired Escape hybrid SUV only after 300,000 miles without any major problem. That's why it's very difficult to find used 2009-2012 Escape Hybrid with lower miles for sale, owner keep this Escape model longer vs. unreliable non-hybrid Escape. Now Toyota released 2016 RAV4 hybrid and will be the only one non-luxury winning combination utility and fuel economy vehicle on today's market that the public most prefer, since Ford Escape hybrid is discontinued and it's hard to find on used car market.",,

Sync system with ipod/bluetooth/sirius support is great.

Once you go hybrid, it's difficult to go back to conventional engines.
It's like taking a step back in technology.


Reliability - Rental purchased with 32k miles and I now have 62k with ZERO problems.
I've read these hybrids are overbuilt and have many heavy duty components installed vs conventional Escapes.

Battery Longetivity - I read an article about a fleet of CA Escape Hybrid taxis being put in retirement after 300k miles.
They were still running solid and the batteries held a greater than 80% charge.
Wow!

Maintenance - Oil changes every 10k, low stress on the engine due to battery,","Convert to lithium ion batteries and make it a plug-in!

It's no wonder major car manufacturers are slow to roll out hybrids/plugins.
With their low maintenance, and longetivity, people will be visiting their dealers less often for maintenance and car purchases.

It's in good shape but I'm only getting 25 miles to the gallon with combined city/hwy driving. And, the gas tank only seems to take 11 gallons when I believe it has a 15 gallon tank. I know it's hot and the aircon has to be on but isn't that still pretty low mileage? Kind of wishing I had bought a new non-hybrid for the same money now.

The sync system is awesome, same with the hands-free phoning, and the satellite radio. I've been getting about 36 mpg - plus it's kinda fun try to keep the tach in the green (battery mode) while driving, it takes a little practice to get good at it - sometimes I even find myself hoping traffic will slow down so I can recharge! On the downside, I have had to take it back to the dealership for two different repairs, will go into more detail below. Overall I am extremely happy with the purchase and would recommend the FEH to anyone (as long as it's still under warranty).

I don't know if my problems are isolated or if other vehicles have the same issues.   The heated seats stay warm only minutes after being turned on.  The seats warm quickly but then fade to cool within about 5 minutes. The air conditioning system is a joke.  When both driver and passenger sides are set to the same temperature, the passenger side, will blow 8 degrees warmer than the drivers side...but only sometimes.  Also, the system can be set at 72 degrees and blow hot but can also blow cold when set to 76.  It's frustrating.  I think the a/c system may be bipolar.

The ride is smooth, although the gas engine is a little loud. The sync feature is nice, except when it doesn't understand your commands. MPG is pretty good. I've had mine for a few weeks and average 30 mpg. The faster you drive, the more it decreases. It is a bit touchy at first and takes some getting used to transitioning from gas to electric. The more I drive it, the easier it is to use the electric motor under 40 vs the gas. If you run the AC, it is difficult to get the electric motor to kick in.

I'll elaborate on the latter. #1 complaint: Can't set Nav system while you're driving. If we want to find an upcoming restaurant while on the freeway, I guess we need to pull over to the side of the road? The fonts are hard to read (orange on light blue??)

Anyway two hours later I had traded in my 2004 Chevy Malibu Maxx for my new FEH.  So far I have put about 8600 miles on it in the 4 months I have had the car and I love driving it.  I've got a 35 mile commute from the north side of Chicago to the western suburbs (a mix of city, freeway and horrendous traffic), and I feel as though the FEH must have been designed to drive my commute.  Long haul trips are a breeze as well with the sync system to entertain (or distract) during long hours behind the wheel.

I have to say this vehicle is a blast to drive once you learn how to coax the electric drive into action.  I really like how this car can sneak up on people in electric mode and make them turn heads as you drive past them at 30-40 mph with only the sound of the wind and the tires on the ground to cue them in to the fact that there's a car nearby.

","More exterior color choices and optional interior color.  Hooks in cargo area.  Door rub strips (prevent door dings). Garage door opener holder instead of eyeglass holder in overhead console (sunroof version).  More sound damping, engine noisy when accelerating.  Disengage cruise control button."
5,Wow,timmy ,09/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This vehicle is just amazing. Averaging 31.5 MPG and I drive 38 miles one way to work, about 25 miles of which is 60 MPH+ highways. I never dreamed I would see this kind of mileage in a 4wd SUV. The ride is very comfortable and smooth even on shoddy michigan roads, but it is not floaty, sloshy, or sluggish like a lot of other SUV's or larger cars can feel. Plenty of power when you step on it - like they advertise it feels like a v-6 when you need it to. I rarely push it though because I'm always concious of mileage. Feel lucky to own it despite the cost - see favorite features below.  ","Engine, suspension, all of it. And the cost - when I sat down and figured out all the costs involved with owning and driving this vehicle it is actually cheaper than my last Grand Am GT. Buy a car and pay less than before? Go look at the price of gas.",The only thing I seem to miss is the speed controled volume on the sound system. I might not have it because I ordered mine with the base sound setup. I just couldn't see spending $2000 on a stereo when I can get a way better one aftermarket for less than half that. base sound is good though. 
4.875,Great Hybrid,Hook686 ,09/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"In this volatile economic world, I find it a real plus to have a motor vehicle that yields me 30-44 mpg of gasoline. This 2009 Ford Escape Hybrid Limited does that for me thus far, and is just plan fun to drive  I'm still on my first tank of gas and getting to know the SYNC  & NAV systems, but thus far I am really pleased. An SUV that gets me 42 mpg around town. I really like that. I will update this as my time with the SUV increases, but for now I could not be happier with my choice ","The door mounted key pad, the navigation (NAV 2) system, the cell phone interface, the hybrid system display, the SYNC system is a joy, the moonroof, the ride, the interior lighting, the leather seats, the ground clearance, the view, the security features (computer chip key), the backup sensors","I cannot think of a thing I would like added, except perhaps Ford added trailer hitch, rather than an aftermarket addition."
4.875,An awesome car overall - love it!,csports786 ,09/16/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got this car about a month ago and have been thoroughly impressed so far! I went with the limited edition one and I'm very happy I did--the navigation is one of the best in the industry, not to mention to helpful fuel economy screen and Sirius information. I believe I'm on my 4th tank of gas, and my last one got 31.5 MPG overall. You can cruise to 40 MPH on electric if you don't accelerate too hard, and the Econ AC is a huge plus. One problem is the interior design--the doors are made of cheap looking plastic material that gets scuffed easily. But don't let this fool you, the car is amazing, and if you hurry you can still get a pretty nice tax credit that helps offset the hybrid premium.","Exterior body styling, consistent MPG, moonroof, navigation, satellite radio and travel link, stereo system, very smooth ride, steering wheel audio controls, SYNC is very useful! In dash power outlet and USB mp3 player hookup","Better interior design, it looks too cheap; price is a bit high but tax credit helps offset it; the reviews are right: engine noise can be somewhat loud when accelerating, and freeway noise is noticeable is a bit annoying too. Not much else, I love the car overall!"
5,2nd time hybrid owner,Riley ,08/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I'm proud to say this is my 2nd Escape hybrid. I know it's still new. I have only had it for a couple of weeks now, but I'm impressed. I had a 2005 Escape Hybrid and to be honest this is why I now have a second one. I traded the 05 in on this one and I have been thrilled on the improvements Ford has done on this vehicle. Tha mileage is better, the ride is better, even the looks are better. I'm impressed. I think Ford has a winner with this one.","The ride, also the gas I save. I love riding by the gas stations and not stopping. If you seem to get a steady pace going on the road even at 60 kms the engine shuts off and lets you cruise on electric.",The only thing I could think of was allow more color choices.
