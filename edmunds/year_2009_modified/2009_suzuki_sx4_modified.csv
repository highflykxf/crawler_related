4,"It's ok, but not after 80,000 miles",Brandie ,12/07/2016,3,3,4,,,4,4,5,4,,,"This car has been wonderful - until this year. My husband and I both have one of these cars. (Mine is orange, his is white) (Mine was bought brand new back in 2009, his was bought used just a year ago.) Repairs were normal wear and tear (new tires, oil changes, etc...) (Btw, we also have manual transmissions).  Well, this year came and these cars have been garbage. One day my orange, bought brand new, car suddenly wouldn't crank. Nothing. So I have to towed in. Turns out the entire freaking computer was somehow damaged. They said it could have been lightening - but we're in a severe drought, it hasn't rained in over a month. It cost me nearly 3 grand to fix. Then my husband's check engine light came on. So we took it in - the two catalytic converters are going bad... and guess how much it is to fix it... 3 grand. If something else goes wrong we're trading these in for something else. I'm so disappointed. Suzuki made older cars, like the X-90 and tracker which are nearly indestructible.",,

2,Lots of repairs,Bob Provencher ,10/22/2016,3,5,4,,,1,4,2,3,,,"I bought this car brand new in 2009.  A rebuilt transmission ($3,000) in 2014, replaced a/c compressor ($1,800) and water pump ($1,200) and finally a thrown rod are all the problems I had to deal with in a relatively new car.  Add to that poor gas mileage and faster than normal break and tire wear led to a pretty expensive car to operate.  Thankfully it was pretty cheap to buy brand new.  I wouldn't buy another one (if I could).",,

4,Low maintenance!,Deborah McDaniel ,09/26/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,We were looking for a replacement for the same year and model where the engine got blown from lack of oil (new driver). In the 5 years we owned this make/model the only maintenance cost was oil changes. My college student driven neglected to change the oil and blew the engine after he moved away from home. I happily replaced it with the same make/model because I knew it would perform well and have low maintenance costs.,,

4,great car for Colorado,JAT ,09/15/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,4,,,"This is a perfect car for living here in Colorado Springs. The only downside is less gas mileage than I would like. But the AWD, traction control, and relatively high ground clearance means that whenever it snows or is icy, it will get you where you need to go. When you see cars pulled off the side of the road, or trying and failing to climb an icy hill, you won't have a problem keeping going. Perfect if you need to get to work or to the Denver airport in marginal road conditions.

We have a SUV too but we use this vehicle for most of our daily driving,trips and errands. I especially like the amount of torque the car has when carrying 5 people. You barely notice any power loss with 5 passengers and I'm not scared to get on the highway with it. We traded in a Honda CRV because of that problem.I have 45k+ miles on it and it's been very reliable.Aside from routine maintenance like oil changes, wiper blades and air filter, I've done nothing. Brakes will need to be changed at 50k miles. Tires need changing now at 45k. My view of Suzuki has positively changed with this vehicle","I have a bad back and the high stance of the car and driver seat feels great on my back. The interior is nice enough. While the interior is not ""high end"", it never felt or looked cheap. People compliment the interior.
Handles very nice for a car with such a high stance. Definitely fun to drive with manual.
It looks small but I'm amazed how much we get in the car. The AWD has been awesome. It's fine in the snow but awesome in the rain which is where the AWD kicks in the most. I bought it new and for the price I paid, I cannot complain.","Wind noise on highway is a bit too loud. I wish the fuel economy was a bit better but the car average has been 27 MPG with AWD & 50/50 city/highway. Not too bad. While the Navigation system is fine the bluetooth going thru it got complaints from everyone receiving my calls. Got lots of ""hard to hear you"" comments. Turns out the plastics surrounding the Nav/microphone vibrate the microphone in the Nav. I fixed it with a rubber piece I made that stopped the vibration. Factory should have better design. 5 cent

For all of the standard equipment included, the value of this car can't be beat. I looked at and drove a lot of other small cars, but the SX4 came out on top. The 5 speed and good pickup makes it a very fun car to drive. Shifting is smooth as I buzz around town and parallel parking is a snap. I also do highway driving and it has sufficient power to hold its own. I was especially glad to have the on-demand 4WD during a VERY SNOWY winter. On several occasions, I zipped up snow-covered hills past other vehicles. NICE!  Slip control is great!  I'm getting 27-28 MPG on combined driving. I have gotten 30 MPG on highway.

The AWD is outstanding in the snow. Love that it can be turned off to save fuel.  Exterior design is unique & looks very European.  The cloth seats are much more comfortable than the leather in my Passat.  Road & engine noise are somewhat intrusive.

3.375,SX4 Upshift Nightmare,Dodger ,01/22/2010,,,3,5,4,5,,3,3,2,2,Do not buy an SX4 Crossover with manual shift!! When I test drove this car I noticed an odd tendency to over- rev when shifting up through the gears but put it down to my unfamiliarity with the car or to the engine being cold. I have driven stick shift cars for the last 35 years and was confident that a slight adjustment in driving style would avoid any issues. How wrong I was! The SX4 has a bizarre electronic throttle linkage that unpredictably decides to rev the engine in between gears when upshifting and no amount of adjustment in style can reliably avoid over-re,,

My goals were to get a car which is capable of getting good gas mileage, hauling dogs, mountain-bikes, and whatever else I needed. Payments had to be moderately low, and the car needed to be reliable, comfortable and perform well. All of these are easily satisfied with the SX4. I have been averaging about 29 mpg with mixed city/highway driving. It has been very comfortable to sit in and drive.

It handles well and grips the road even with stock tires.",Utilitarian vehicle Design Price Gas mileage Handling Ergonomics Standard Features Transmission,"The 5 speed manual has a high cruising RPM, and this has probably been remedied with the 6 spd gearbox.

I did a lot of research & I knew what to expect. It's a lot of extra's for the money, but if you are looking for luxury, this is not the car for you.  I love my car!  Great job Suzuki!",Mentioned the long list in my review =),"Add a sunroof, a sixth gear (manual), and a little more power."

1.75,Biggest Mistake Yet,Lacy ,08/21/2009,,,2,2,2,2,,2,2,1,1,"In the short while that I've owned this car, the airbag sensor has gone off---requiring the front passenger seat to be replaced.  It now squeaks continuously if someone sits in it.  The Keyless entry/start system seems to be questionable---I have now had to replace the key fobs twice because they do not recognize the car.  There are 3 small cheap plastic coverings under the back seat---one of these fell off the other day.  Apparently, the car I purchased is less than perfect.  It only has 2,000 miles on it.  I'm so wishing I could get rid of it, but I'm stuck with it for the time being.  One certainly gets what one pays for.",Nothing.,"A more quiet engine or better soundproofing--- tired of engine growling.  Larger gas tank please.  If the mpg is going to be this lackluster, at least give the engine more power so that it doesn't drone while going up a simple hill or a ramp on the freeway. "

4.875,Recent buy....Loving it so far,KR ,07/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Loving the Suzuki Crossover so far. Got the loaded Touring trim. Lots and lots of extras for the money. CAN NOT beat the features for the money. Nav, heated seats and mirrors, keyless entry and start. Great safety features...insureance only went up $12/yr. Drives and handles great. Biggest for us, was the AWD. Can't wait to drive it around during a Maine winter.  We've owned Toyota, Mitsu, VW, Dodge, Pontiac.  We believe we got the best value for the money, by far, this time around.   We also love that everyone else isn't driving one. We'll see how it holds up. If it does well for a while, we plan to return for a Suzuki purchase for our other vehicle...the Equator truck to replace a Durango.","3 Mode AWD, heated seats, fog lights, navigation, AWD, skid plates on front and rear, cross bars, ski rack, also the AWD if I didn't mention it.  Didn't think the keyless entry and start was a big deal...but we use it way more than we thought.  I haven't used the key yet.","For the keyless entry, smaller key holder.  The thing is huge. That's about it.  We really, really like this car.  What you get for what you pay....you can't beat it."

1.375,"Unhappy follow up to ""Bye Bye Benz""",tsloan ,07/11/2009,,,1,4,1,1,,1,1,1,1,"I've had the 2009 Suzuki SX4 Crossover for less than a month now.  It is scheduled to go into the shop early next week because the airbag light has come on and will not go off.  Browsing the internet blogs I have discovered that this is quite problematic for Suzuki and the SX4.  Other owners have complained that Suzuki is not honoring its warranty and are not being cooperative.  A courtesy car will most likely not be offered since the car is technically operable (just not sure how safe it is to drive? will the airbags deploy when I driving down the street?  do the airbags work?)  The fuel economy continues to be very poor.  The driver's seat is causing back pain, and I'm a healthy 38yo man.",none: I retract all positive statements made about this car.,"build a reliable car; seating and lumbar support built for  American anatomy (Im 5'8"" lean, muscular, and weigh 165lbs)"

5,"Great, misunderstood car",baldwin ,06/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a great car! I've had mine for a year now, and it has run flawlessly and handles great. It very much is the crossover vehicle that it is supposed to be. It is a very small cross-over SUV. People want to compare it to sub- compacts, but it is really not in that class. It has much bigger wheels and chassis, which reduce its gas mileage, but give it much greater strength when stressed. It has a 7"" ground clearance, vs 4"" for most sedans. This car can be compared to smaller SUVs. Think of something like a Hundai Tuscon, but strip away all the hunky metal. An extremely lean frame is put onto a solid chassis. It has plenty of room for 4 people. It drives well at high speeds/ long distances.",SUV-like features. Excellent fuel mileage when properly compared with other crossovers. Great handling. Excellent for parking. Quite comfortable.,The small front-side window creates a bit of a blind spot.

3.875,Bye-bye Benz,tsloan ,06/22/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,2,3,"I traded my 2005 C-class 4matic mercedes for touring model of the sx4 crossover.  I was wanting a smaller car with awd for the colorado winters.   I've only had the car a few days.  So far so good.  It is sporty getting around town, but it really has to work hard to get up the foothills of the Rocky Mts.  SX$ has the same fuel economy as the benz. I seriously considered the Honda Fit, but the Fit had a rough ride on even smooth roads and had horrible road noise even at low speeds.  The SX4 has a surprisingly smooth ride and minimal road noise.  It is a little more exotic than the hondas and toyotas- --at least around Denver.  The view from inside the car gives impression of a bigger car",AWD; the price point of the car for the number options available; the warranty; heated seats and mirrors,"better fuel economy PLEASE; sunroof option; leather seating; a button to open the hatch on that brick of a key fob; a hatch release button on the driver's door; security system standard; the fuel release looks cheap as does the paneling on inside of the hatch door; cloth seating is thin, cheap"

4.5,2009 Suzuki SX4 crossover vs. 2008 Sedan,Jaysx409 ,04/12/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"I bought a 2008 SX4 Sedan last June that got totaled when someone rear- ended me on April fools' day.  So I get a 2009 SX4 Crossover with navigation, and would like to point out the differences I noticed from the 2008 Sedan, which I put over 13,000 miles on.  5-Speed: Smoother clutch action, easier to make smoother shifts.  Shifter works smoother too.  Ride: Electronic Stability Program (ESP) is also standard.  I noticed less body roll in sharp curves and a more stable ride quality.  More fun to drive!  Interior: Controls a little smoother, interior panels seem to be of better quality.  And I can't help but love the hatch with the fold-and-tumble seats, along with a rear window wiper.",Body trim package and alloy wheels,How about a 6-Speed with a turbo?

4.5,Awesome little AWD car!  Love it,Busy Mom ,03/30/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"I bought this car right before winter started (I had a Toyota Matrix before) and boy was I glad!  This car is great in the snow.  It gets me where I need to be, from snowy roads in New Hampshire through crowded streets and in tight parking spots in downtown Boston.  This car is powerful, small, easy to parallel park, and fun to drive. Although it is small, it is well designed.  My son sits in the back in his toddler seat no problem.  I have also sat in the backseat, and while it isn't as spacious as a SUV of course, your feet aren't squished.  The seats and spacing is well designed.",Love the audio controls on the steering wheel!  (I am spoiled now and don't like my husbands car).  Built in GPS and mileage meter is also nice.  All- wheel drive/ front-wheel drive switch is also great.,Bigger gas tank!!!  I have come very close to running out of gas with this car a couple of times.  A more minor annoyance is the car seat alarm goes off for the passenger seat when I put a briefcase down (anything larger than my purse sets it off....)

4.875,The Unknown Car?,Keefe ,02/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This purchase was forced on me by my dying truck.  I was trying to wait until the summer but had to go car shopping a little early.  I test drove the automatic which was what I wanted.  This thing moves pretty well.  The steering is tight and very responsive. The interior has plenty of head room and the dash is very well lit.  AWD is available, but I haven't used it yet. Snow has been lite. Strange thing is people question me on why I brought this car instead of a Honda, Subaru, Ford,etc.  For me, I like to think outside of the box and not be the follower.  This car is more than what some would think.  Give it a shot before you shoot it down.  You'll enjoy the Crossover and its features.","The seats, the Garmin, the interior design, and exterior design. AWD for this price is unbeatable. She looks agressive with the 17"" tires and low slumping front. The space in the rear is great for camping gear. Very satisfied with this crossover.",Gas mileage. To offer a Hybrid or a higher mileage vehicle would put this puppy on the map. Maybe the option for a sunroof?

4.875,Joe J's Review Ft Lauderdale,Joe Johnson ,12/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought the middle, tech package with 2WD  and 5-speed. The car is great fun to drive and a rare small crossover model that is actually comfortable with great seats and dash layout. I test drove the automatic, but it was boring. The 5 speed is more like a beamer in that it drives very tight, corners and hugs the road nicely and is fun. The layout of the folding seats is well designed and there's plenty of room in the back for stowing items. With auto show coupon and rebate, car is available way below dealer cost. best value in mini crossovers, under 16K for the tech package. Car even comes with loaner privileges and 3 year roadside assistance. Wish I had gotten AWD but don't need it in FL.","Comfortable seats, great driving experience, love the free Garmin that comes with it with one year free MSN. You can find cheap gas, find movie schedules, get news and weather and traffic. This Garmin even has a built in mp3 player that stores your songs like an ipod and plays back thru speakers","Would be nice to tilt the gauges toward the driver. In the daytime, it's hard to read middle gauges. Middle arm rest gets in the way of locking the seat belt, and there's no console or locking compartment. Does not come standard with ipod jack, very short sighted. Otherwise a great car. 23- 30 mpg."
