As soon as the warranty expired at 60,000 miles, the transmission failed.Two weeks after replacing the transmission($2700), the air bag sensor in the passenger seat failed ($1500).After the sensor, a host of electrical problems surfaced.Since the car cost us more in repairs in than it was worth over a year, we sold it and won't touch another KIA.","Comfortable seats, peppy and fuel efficient engine.","Quality control.
Cars should not fall apart at 60,000 miles.

The dealer tried to blame us for any and all problems the vehicle had.
They told us the transmission fluid was low, causing failure and that we dumped a lot of water on the seat to cause the air bag sensor to fail.

It has a high safety rating, roomy interior, good stereo options and best of all great EPA rating for a midsize sedan. It's comfortable on the highway and zips around town.

I told the wife that I was going to buy her an import this time because everybody knows they are more reliable, last longer, and you generally get a fair trade in value.  I took a long time shopping on the internet and this Kia Optima was by far the best value for the money. As others have stated the standard equip. is very generous. But that was not the main reason I purchased this vehicle. It was safety. Here's a quote from the carconnection.com: "" When it comes to crash-test ratings, you won't find many better than that of the Kia Optima's.  10/10 crash test.""","Interior/Exterior styling. Headlight beam (Both high & low) is very good. Steering wheel controls, Roomy engine compartment.  Easy access to everything.

The price was right and I am constantly turning heads in my new black Kia.  I feel like I have one up on the Camry and Honda drivers.  The drive is nice, the car is roomy, great on mileage and  highly rated for safety.  This was the best purchase I could have made.",The styling The mileage The handling,The stereo system could be better

5,Best car for the money in a long time,Elmo ,08/31/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am 60 and cars have always been a hobby of mine. I decided to trade in my HHR due to rusting and other problems. I have looked at many cars and drove several and I like this car over the camry and accord, witch cost 10000 more comparably equipped. I chose the SX 4cyl model and so far I am totally delighted. Who knows what the future brings but so far excellent! I never thought I would buy a Kia but, I have to say they have come a long way.","Navigation, voice command driven radio and navigation, excellent interior, heated seats, auto dimming mirrors heated mirrors, very modern styling. It actually came with extra lugnuts!! 10 year warranty","Lumbar on the sx model,I Miss that"

5,Another Great Kia,Chris ,08/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Before I purchased my Optima I had a 2008 Kia Spectra in which was a great car. When I traded in I had 47k miles no problem what so ever. I went to the dealership to get an oil change when I saw that 2009 Optima Midnight Blue and it was love at first sight. The price, style and performance are great. First look at this car and you would say that's a car that is in the 30k range. My optima was in the low 20's and with the rebates and the fact that I was a current Kia owner that made the rebates even greater. I would say Kia is my car of chose hands down. Kia keep on keeping on.",Performance and Style,NONE

I am very happy and plus have the best warranty in the business.  ","climate control, navigation is amazing and radio really sounds great!",lumbar on sx

5,4th kia,LONG TIME KIA FAN! ,08/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Had for 6 months and have put 4,000 miles on it. Had a 2006 sportage and saw the optima and had to have it. I am blown away at the attention it gets. People are always telling me they love its looks and the red color is sharp. I just smile when I pull up beside a accord or Camry and think to myself I saved thousands and have an equal car. The optima feels smooth and plenty of power from the I-4 it only has a few less horse power than the v-6, save a few bucks and buy the I-4. The trunk really holds a lot and the car is comfortable on long trips. The gas mileage is as advertised which many cars do not match up. So we are very pleased. We do recommend kia to everyone we know.","sat.radio, elect seats, telescopic and tilt steering, turn sigs in mirrors, aluminum alloy wheels. triponic transmission.","blue instead of red displays, not much else."

5,Great Car at a Great Price ,p71 ,08/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was looking to replace my wifes car and not sure what with.  Had a mini van and wanted something with better gas mileage alone with a little more comfort.  looked at Subru, Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Chevy and Ford.  I am 6'4"" Kia had the most leg room front and back.  Great comfort and great pep out of a four cylinder.  Nicely equipped in standard options.  To early to say how well it will last but I would say it will out last just by the feel of engine tranny (5 speed auto) that this car will out last any American four cylinder out there.  175 hp not bad at all for a 4 banger.      ",Leg room dash ,for the price I can't think of one!!!

5,Blown away,carman09 ,08/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I drove  an Accord, Camry Mercedes just to name a few. I drove an Optima and was totally blown away. I would have picked them over the others any but when you throw in the cost it is truly unbelievable. This car has everything you can imagine as options, has road manners that of an Accord. I drove a camry (32,000) comparably equipped. The only thing the kia didn't have was a 3yr, 36000 warranty. The Kia has a 5yr 60000 bumper to bumper and 10 yer 100000 warranty!  Very happy!.

2.625,Big Mistake !!!,Chad ,08/03/2009,,,3,3,1,1,,3,3,3,4,"As soon as I got home, the trunk release button on the door already quit working.  The headlights never worked but the high beam headlights.  Took it back to the dealer the next day, they couldn't tell why or what is causing the problems.   I was told to bring it back next week and leave it for someone else to diagnose the problems.  If you or someone you know is looking for a car, please take my advice and stay away from a Kia dealership.   ",Smooth ride.,Quality and reliability.

5,2009 Kia Optima SXV6 = Winner,tsuttonjr ,07/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This vehicle is a pleasure to drive.  Solid road manners, quiet along normal paved surfaces, decent accelaration, most luxury features available for the money.  It is very stylish, more reminiscent of an Infiniti or Acura vehicle.  The build quality of Kia is higher than previously expected.  The speedodmeter reads to 160 mph and may reach 140-150 mph given the gearing & feel of it's accelaration if it is not speed governed.  I ordered mine and received it with 4 miles total. I have been happy every since.","Power everything stand on this model.  Windows, doors, both front seats, auto- dimming compass mirror; paddle shifters, audio & cruise controls all on steering wheel.  Satellite radio.  My black optima came with chrome door handles, window trim, and most exterior trim. 225/50R17 tires with alloy rims",Strut tower bars in the front and rear would help settle the car faster when making sudden lane changes.  Possibly tuning the anti-sway bar may help also.  Utilizing the new 3.3L V6 engine from the Hyundai Sonata would give more overall power to this same car.

5,Whoa!!!,Big John ,06/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a keeper.  Rides great, great gas mileage at 34 HW, low initial cost, low insurance premiums, sharp looking, great lines, best color combination (Ruby red, w/charcoal interior), turns heads everywhere I go.  Nobody can believe this is an Optima.  Ever seen the old styles?  Those things were ghastly.  This one looks nothing like them from any angle.  I intended to buy another Rio, but when I spotted this Optima, it was case closed.  MPG is about the same as the Rio, but the car has way more charm.  Love it.","Cruise control, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, A/C, spacious cabin, arm rest, cup holders, pwr outlets, susper radio and speakers, humungus trunk, very peppy off the line.  Great gas mileage, sharp car.",Road noise is a little intrusive on rough roads.  In states that maintain roads adequately she just breezes right along with nary a sound.

5,Best Kia yet,Big John ,06/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got tired of buying premium gas required for my Dodge and sought a new car.  Having owned a couple of Kia Rio's I thought Kia might have a deal in progress.  When I spotted the '09 Optima, I was sold.  New sleek lines, great price/rebates, 100K warranty, large interior, great acoustics, decent acceleration for a four banger.  I began using premium and got 36 miles to a gallon on the highway.  I eventually switched to regular and get 34 mpg.  The Rio's cost 2 grand less and get 37 mpg.  Bigger car, more options, excellent gas mileage.  I run about 4,000 miles a month and the 2 grand over the Rio was worth every dime.  Turns heads everywhere.  ","Cruise control, ABS, Stability control, tilt telescopic wheel, steering wheel audio controls, ash tray, appearance, spacious trunk, ample back seats, headlights that throw light way down the road, visbility, this car has it all.","I'm not keen on the red illumination of the audio pod nor the red odo items.  I think green would be a better choice.  In daylight hours the red is not easily visible on the black background, when driving into the sun.  "

5,Optima was our clear choice,MSgt Ken ,04/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Very very nice midsize sedan. I was looking to replace my wife's car and the Optima was the clear winner. We looked at Camry, Malibu, Elantra & Accord and the Optima was the winner based on features, styling and price. The $5000 mark down we got really helped. The Metallic Bronze is a head turner in the sun and we like the interior and exterior styling. We also have a Borrego and Kia has done their homework; clean conservative styling and nice standard features. Great basic features, great styling, very roomy cabin and a great value. We would highly recommend the Optima for ""The family 4 door sedan"". ","Styling, interior space, gas mileage, huge trunk, visibility, controls are easy to use and find. Smooth, quiet stable ride.",Add cup holders and storage for back seat passengers to the rear of front seat console. Larger side rear view mirrors.

4,traded down from a Sorento,Shanna ,03/11/2009,,,2,5,4,5,,4,4,4,4,"Bought car 3 wks ago after buying a Sorento I had 8 wks. This car was suggested by dealership. I highway miles a day so I'm a bit dissapointed. My kids are a bit tight w/ 2 boosters  & a 13 yr old in back, but it's doable and he can buckle ok. The side mirrors are rectangular & takes getting use to, don't feel like I always get good coverage. Power's good & handles huge daily hill ok. The material is CHEAP & pills (balls up on seats). I'll be investing in seat covers! Got silver & it hides dirt well, looks sharp. Happy w/ purchase, wish I had electric seats/sunroof but was upside down & couldn't afford more. overall I dig it.","MP3 outlet, Serius radio (only 3 months though), looks SHARP in Silver! (I tinted windows too - very nice!), radio & cruise on steering wheel, glove box bigger then Sorento, good interior & trunk lighting, no attena to deal with, feels sturdy and safe. Overall GREAT car!","the trunk is REALLY heavy for this size car! (for any car...). I won't let my kids around it because I'm afraid they'll get smashed fingers. Put larger side mirrors, use better quality & more durable material on seats!!! "

5,In Love,karen ,02/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I recently purchased a 2009 Kia Optima and  I'm totally having a ball driving it. I looked at Toyota, Chevrolet, Mercury and Nissan. I could not have afford all the extras I have with my Kia. Its metal bronze color which looks different in various lights sun cloudy etc. I have a moon roof and really nice leather. Awesome sound Infinity 6 speakers and 6 cd changer plus satellite radio. Heated front seats plus all the equipment that comes standard for about 10k less then the other cars.  Also have 5 year road side assist and warranty. Thank you Kia",Heated seats turn signals on the outside mirrors.

5,Shocked!!,LovingmyKia! ,12/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I never would have bought anything but a Honda or a Toyota. I was so biased against Kia that I wouldn't even look at their features. Then I was driving past the Kia dealership, and a car caught my eye - the redesigned 2009 Optima EX V6 in Metal Bronze! I stopped, took a test drive, and was completely AMAZED! Kia made the redesigned Optima look like a real competitor, and my car turns heads! I am shocked at the power from the small V6, better gas mileage than my Honda, better warranty, and it was surprisingly inexpensive for the features. I can't wait till the dealership installs my OEM navigation system! For being a Kia hater, I now wouldn't drive anything else. Kia's slogan definitely true!","Sharp edgy original exterior styling, the solid feeling of shutting the door (feels very quality) LOVE the lumbar support, very safe car, inexpensive, awesome sound system, powerful and fuel efficient engine, leather feels high quality, Sirius is really nice, the color is different and looks great!!","Kia needs to advertise this car, because it is the best they have ever done!"
