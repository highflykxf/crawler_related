5,Love the Accord,Sharon Deis ,11/19/2016,5,4,5,,,5,5,5,4,,,"Be prepared to have a car that works every time you get in to it.  The back seat is just as comfortable as the front seats.  Very low maintenance costs.  This car will last 20 years if you want to drive it that long!  The look of the car is timeless, many cars built today look similar.",,
5,Second owner at 80K,Me ,07/22/2016,5,3,5,,,5,5,4,4,,,"I've had this car for a couple years now, and it is at 166K (mostly highly) now.  This car has treated me greatly, and I would definitely recommend one for anyone looking for a used model.  It's a heavy car, but very stable, earlier models of the previous generation felt alot more nibble.  If you use a good set of tires, it will make all the difference in the snow.  It has its quirks here and there, but overall you seldom have to be under the hood to repair it past basic maintenance.  When it comes to parts and repair, these cars are expensive when going through your Honda dealer, but they are so reliable it makes up for the cost.",,

I did a lot of research and was concerned about the 4cyl using oil as that complaint was reported by some 08-09 owners but in 3k miles I haven't used a drop.  Seats are comfortable and handling is good.  It's just a 4 cyl so don't expect great performance.  It's geared right so even going up hills it rarely downshifts. Honda tends to build good cars and this is no exception, even though it's already 7 yrs old, everything is tight, no rattles.  I drive 25 mi to work every day and get about 30 mpg.  Only thing I don't like is there's no outside temp. display, seems odd that was left out.

2,Accord aint what it once was,Brad Till ,02/01/2016,3,2,3,,,3,3,4,3,,,"This is the 2nd Accord I've owned. The first was bought new in 1993. Drove it for 15 years and never missed a beat. Fantastic car. But the 2009 has been a huge disappointment. Here's a laundry list of it's shortcomings:Rear brakes have been replaced twice. (97000 miles on car) 1st time under warranty (partially) 2nd time on me. rotors pads and calipers.Rear deck rattles along with various rattles from the dash.Carpet on passenger side won't stay put.Keyfobs (yes both) are inoperable.At 90,000 it began burning oil. Now burns a quart of oil every 1500-1700 miles, but Honda says that's normal (BS).Road noise is rather high.Fan for the heater/AC is squeaky on low. So it's high or tear your hair out with aggravation.Drivers seat is good for about an hour of driving before back ache sets in.I kept the car cause it was paid for, but the oil burning is the final straw for me. Getting rid of it soon. Won't ever get another Honda.",,
4,Great Dad car - teens won't like it but it's safe,b sommer ,01/25/2016,3,4,4,,,3,4,4,3,,,"For this model, Honda reduced the size of the rear brake calipers. As a result, you'll need new rear disc brake pads every 30,000 miles. I still have 70% of the original pads left on the front pads. This issue was subject of a class action suit. After litigating, Honda did not address the problem. You'll be buying lots of rear brake pads with this car. Additionally, the rear brakes don't release the brake dust. It just accumulates on the pads and makes for a nasty grumbling sound when you hit the brakes most days. It's annoying and it contributes to uneven rotor wear. This means more trips to the brake shop. The seats in this car are pretty basic. Fabric covered foam seats that aren't the best for long drives. Okay for short trips - bad for a long road trip. Fuel economy, for such a large car, is pretty good. High 20s for most driving - higher on the highways lower in the city. Winter formulated fuel (here in Chicago) will lower MPG by 3-4 MPG. It's spacious. I've hauled a ton of things in it. visibility is really goodMy kids won't drive it - it's too much a dad-car. But they did use it to move into college!",,
5,My First Honda Has Been A Winner,Joy Babb ,01/08/2016,4,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"Manufacturer advises against a trailer hitch including one that would hold a bike away from your car because it sits low to ground and bumper cover is closer to ground than other years. Dealer told me after purchase, you should always use a flat bed truck for this year model if ever has to be towed; otherwise, fiberglass of bump can get damaged. The exterior noise level that can be heard in the car is terrible, especially at high speed. I noticed in the test drive, even with with high frequency hearing loss but did not dismiss the car because of its safety report and history of low repairs over 5 years on this model on the Edmunds' website (Sorry, I haven't been able to relocate that very useful tool). As an original owner in July 2009 to January 7, 2016, there has been one repair that would have been close to a grand but I had bought the best extended warranty my dealer recommended. Interior is great! Two men have sat in my car at the same time who were ~ 6 feet. Trunk is a dream - holds 4 wheeled carry on bags. It has no navigation but I do not miss it. I love this car as much as I did my three rear wheeled drive Mercury Cougars ( gave up on this one when they went front wheel drive) but now get better miles/gallon. No plans to sell. I tend to hold on to cars 10-16 years. For mostly city driving the noise is not noticeable but on trips of more than an hour of highway, it is miserable because you cannot hear the radio without turning it up loud.",,
4,"Dependable, Comfortable, Quick & Nimble!",Honest John ,11/30/2015,4,4,4,,,5,3,4,4,,,"This car is pretty much perfect. It gets over 30MPG Hwy and makes 271HP. As an Audi S4 owner, I'm rather hard to impress with performance or style, but this tight little V6 did the job! It's a bit noisy on the road, a trade-off for the lower profile tires, but given the handling improvement they provide, they are well worth it. The one caveat would be the brake rotors. The stock ones warped the first week we owned the car. Jon Jones Chevrolet was quick to turn them at no charge, but now, about a year later, they are slightly warped again. I feel as if the car should have beefier brakes, given its performance. I would like to address the guy who wrote about Honda cars being ""pieces of junk"" while extolling the virtues of the Mercedes Benz line. Just read the Consumer Reports reviews on Honda's and Benz's and you will see that dependability-wise, the BENZ is surely the ""piece of junk."" The fact that you pay three times too much for the heavy, ugly German vehicles makes them a true fool's purchase. Most Mercedes owners realize this about the time the warranty runs out and they encounter their first REPAIR BILL!",,
2,Eats OIL,robell ,11/28/2015,1,3,1,,,1,3,3,3,,,"Beware after 50.000 miles this car started using oil . Last oil change went 750 miles and used 3 quarts of oil . They did extend warranty because of this problem but good luck getting them to honor it.  Just search oil usage Honda.  They say one quart   for a thousand miles is normal.  Also say to let sit 15 min before checking . If there isn't oil on stick when you pull it out it  isn't good .  The oil pan is the reservoir for the engine if it isn't there the engine isn't getting it.  I would really think twice about this car before buying . I was a GM Pontiac mechanic so I do know engines and cars.  Update :They did rebuild pistons and rings , So far so good 6,000 miles and no oil usage !",,
5,A superb quality car,Scott ,11/01/2015,5,4,5,,,5,4,4,5,,,"My wife absolutely loves her Accord.  It's our first Honda car (although we've owned Honda powersports equipment) and we couldn't be more pleased.    Purchased at 35,000 miles on the clock and 41,000 miles later, all we've done are oil changes, a new battery, new tires and brakes.    The only issue that we were somewhat disappointed in was having to replace the rear brakes at 50,000...and it just wasn't the pads.  We had to replace calipers, rotors AND pads.  But, some of that could be attributed to the cold, snowy climate that we live in (Northern NY).   Other than that, the car has been a joy to own.   Surprisingly decent power is supplied by the 2.4L 190 HP 4 cylinder engine and the 5-speed manual transmission.  The 5-speed shifts smoothly and is a blast to run through the gears.  Inside, the car is very comfortable and the 8-way power seats are wonderful.   It's very good in snow IF you run snow tires on it, especially with the 5-speed and front wheel drive.    Great sound system with the multi-CD changer & 6 speaker setup.  Air conditioning works great as well---you have to wear a jacket if you have it on.  The Accord is a very high-quality vehicle, and we would recommend it to anyone.   My wife will be back for another one...if I can ever get her to part with this one.",,

We would NEVER have suggested such a purchase with this piece of crap.

I'm hoping to get this heep fixed and passed on to a mechanic that can constantly work on and put oil in it weekly!!  I don't know where the oil is going but I know this is the biggest piece of CRAP EVER MADE. HONDA NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT OWNS ONE.

All purchased new and each new model has been progressively worse, in quiet , comfort and reliability.  I am fastidious about car maintenance and the detail of maintenance of this Accord has been excellent. The car is noisey and has rattles . The braking system has been nothing short of unreliable. All brakes and rotors have been replaced 2x and now it appears as if we must replace a brake caliper... it is locking up on us after short trips. We have also replaced wheel bearings and have had an on going oil problem. This oil problem is related to the same issues that prompted the class action suit. ",Looks and acceleration.,"One does not purcahse a Honda and expect the aforementioned issues. We have owned 7 Honda's in our family and can state unequivically that this trend will end with our next purchase. It is only because of an excellent mechanic that we endure this car. He discovered the oil issue long before the action suit. After changing the oil ( when the change oil indicator came on, as most Honda customers do) he changed the oil , checked the dipstick and stated, this new oil already has carbon in it. We now change the oil every 3k and check the level between changes. Not the Honda recomended 5-7.5 k.  This car must have been built on a Monday with all Chinese supplied parts and engineering.

Road/tire noise is excessive. For now, I blame it on original Michelin tires until I replace them in the next few months. I also bought a 2009 Mercedes E350 RWD with Sport/AMG package last summer.

The ones sitting at the back of the engine were much more worn out-more burned/blackish. and this is after the software update. So either they still wear out very unevenly, or Calgary Honda never replaced the back sprkplugs, since access to to back ones is more difficult. So either Honda desing sucks, or Honda dealrship sucks, take your pick. ----------------I'm posting this review for those who had problems with the VCM/engine misfire. It happened to us last week. Without a warning the car started stuttering and the flashing engine light came on. It sounded to me like a timing/sparkplugs problem.

Honda is claiming the current issues are not related to the design of the engine and is requiring me to pay $825 for labor to fix my car.
When the ""Check Engine"" light came on my car I have always taken it to the nearest Honda dealership immediately and this car has never overheated.
When they applied the fix in December, they checked the heads to make sure they were not warped.
Therefore, how Honda has concluded misfire issues on the front bank cylinders are not related to problems caused by the VCM system is beyond me.

Bottom-line, I strongly recommend you do not purchase any 2008-2012 Honda with the V6 VCM system.","Replace this engine with a new design.

The steering is solid, the transmission is very well mated to the engine.

They blew it on the brakes and I hope the lesson was learned.
The seats are a bit stiff and the head rests were apparently designed by their corporate attorneys - with little chance of backlash and even less of achieving comfort.
The ride can be a bit harsh but I am not sure I am willing to give up any handling to achieve a softer ride, we have lots of round-abouts and the Accord makes them fun to negotiate.
The trunk is a bit small, especially with the arm bars, but I understand this is a concession to the Accord's unique suspension which I really like.

I bought the 09' Accord because I wanted a new Honda (all my others had been 2nd/3rd owner cars) But, simply put, this 2009 is a disaster - from the sub par brakes, the sub par interior, the sub par dash, to the squeaky fan noise that everyone can hear except the Honda Dealership - all before 20,000miles. It's like they fired all of their good engineers and hired the interns. Simply put, DO NOT BUY a HONDA. You will regret it. ","Handling. I live in Europe and the Handling is pretty good for such a big car. Also, the getup and go is pretty spiffy for a 4cylinder. It also looks good - from the MB C class snub nose to the angular forward lean, the car looks good. But that's where it ends. ","Honda needs to rehire the engineers that gave it the reputation of being a solid car in the 80's - 90's, because right now, Honda is running on the fumes of its former glory. 

Honda built a heaver car, but never upgraded the brakes (really?), hence brakes warp the rotors and burn out prematurley. 

The high pitched fan noise is amazingly annoying - you must compensate by keeping the fan on 3 and radio above 15. The noise comes from the passenger side and is perfectly angled directly at the driver's right ear. Talk about hours of cruel and unusual punishment. 

The dash, what a disaster. It's like they ran out of time designing it and pushed out what they had.

3.875,Overall very good - details missing,Steve ,03/16/2010,,,4,3,3,4,,4,5,4,4,The car rides well and with a powerful V6 its about as powerful as a FWD can get.  Rides well and the interior is comfortable but - suspension is poor and you feel all the bumps.  I think the added weight on the EXL model causes this.

The car has some great features, but it's becoming clear that Honda cut corners to keep the costs down.  It's a good looking car and is roomy.  However, Honda service is not great. Spent too much time at the dealer, and they are always suspicious that it's my fault rather than manufacturing defects.  I'm sorry I traded in my 2006 Accord for this one because it was just a better built car without any issues.  Honda needs to get back their core basics.","Good stereo, comfortable seating position, lots of room, decent looks, fuel economy not too bad with 4 cylinder (30 - 31 mpg).","ROAD NOISE!  There's no excuse.  Door seals are pitiful!

My driving habits have not changed, mainly highway, over the years.  If I would have known that I would be spending $200 every 15,000 or so miles, I would not have purchased this vehicle.  Also, another disappointment with this vehicle is the Blue Tooth and nav. system.  The microphone does not pick up the pitches and determines it own thinking of what I am saying.

Honda has a reputation of bullet-proof cars, but this particular model is lacking in several ways.  1st, the remote door control has been defective.  Not just my model, its a common complaint and Honda has a SB about fixing it.  2nd, the rear brake design is horribly inefficient.  The 08 and 09 models have a bad reputation of wearing out rear pads anywhere after 15k miles.  In my case, they wore down to the metal at the 22k mark, but from internet reports most go out before this far.  3rd, this engine seems to consume oil at a faster than normal rate.

I can actually see the tach. spike 200-400 rpms and then fall back into gear, with an accompanying pulse of acceleration. It's very annoying.

Honda needs to stand behind the quality of their cars.  Apparently there have been a lot of complaints and people are not being taken seriously.  These cars are too expensive for this kind of problems and customer service. 
2.5,"Uncomfortable Seats,  Road noise",Will ,11/22/2009,,,3,5,1,4,,3,1,2,1,"Just bought the car. Owned a lot of cars and I must say this is the most uncomfortable seats in any car I have owned.  It hurts the lower part of your back after a half hour. It's like a hard lumbar that doesn't go away. Called Honda America, and they said that they will document it.

4.875,My Black on Black Accord Coupe,BlackBeauty ,11/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is very fun to drive, very solid build, and very roomy for a midsize 2 door coupe.  The V6 gets good gas mileage considering the amount of performance it has and power whenever you need it.  The inside is comfortable and is not as bad as some people make it out to be, but it is no Mercedes or BMW.  Ride quality is above average, but could be a little better on a $30K MSRP car.  It is very beautiful inside and out. I opted for black on black, design is superb, and the chrome additions to the car make it look 10x better.  When I first bought it my coworkers thought it was a Jag or Lexus and liked it better than my coworker's Lexus that they had just purchased.  So far I'm very happy!","Powerful V6 engine, decent fuel economy, roominess inside the vehicle, ample trunk room, sound system isn't the best in the industry but it is above average, transmission is diverse and very responsive, aux port is hidden and very useful, love the safety ratings and all the airbags, and htd mirrors.","Ride quality slightly better on the EXL top of the line, reduce wind noise a little but it's the best out of any car I've owned, make Bluetooth standard, make HID's and auto dimming rearview standard on this model, move the heated seat switches, climate control operation is a bit busy."

I never imagined owning a Honda after Nissan vehicles for the last 15 years. The Accord meets my expectations in styling, performance and workmanship. I don't understand why so many people are complaining about road noise and lack of comfort. The Accord does have a firm ride which adds to good handling. I don't like mushy ride and a loose steering wheel. I find that the Accord handles better than the 3 Maximas that I owned. The interior is very roomy and well made (no squeaks and rattles that I had with Nissan). I have not had one problem in the first 90 days of ownership.

Ride quality, quality of workmanship, handling, performance are all excellent.  It is a fun car to drive.  I can find nothing negative about this vehicle.  The seats are very comfortable.  This is an excellent vehicle for the price.  Comparatively speaking, I consider it equal to Mercedes, Audis, and BMWs.","Navigation system, blue tooth, leather seats, rear seat leg room and comfort.

The torque may seem delayed, but the power is there when the Vtech kicks in. The engine noise is noticeable, but it sounds nice. It's not straining to move the car. It's a lot of car for the money. Maybe not the best at anything, but really good at everything. It's a big car, make no mistake about it. Coming out of a Civic it's huge. But I wanted a big car. Maybe not ""fun"" to drive, but very easy to drive.","Suspension tuning - sporty for a car this size but not too firm. Vtech 4 cylinder.  Transmission shifts smooth and knows where to go. Nice, sweeping dash and lots of storage cubbies. Great visibility. Cup holders actually HOLD cups when the car is moving!","Driver's left arm-rest seems low and away, and the door is high and has no ledge with the window closed to rest the arm on.

I actually like the firm ride and road feel which offers strong cornering and good tracking. I paid $23,300.00 for EX-L version with the 4 cylinder and I'm extremely happy with the purchase. The interior is very roomy and offers good comfort. The Accord has a unique design that offers a sporty European look. I decided to go with the 4 cylinder for the fuel economy and sufficient 190 HP on a FWD. I compared to BMW 3 series and Lexus compact and decided to keep the $7,000 difference in my pocket.  You can get more car but you'll have to pay extra for it!",Handling and 4 cylinder power.  Interior design and comfort.

Overall, this is easily the most intelligently designed car I've ever owned.  It irritated me that Detroit couldn't bother to put as much effort into their designs as Honda does.  Took a while to get used to the transmission rhythm (went from 3 to 5 speeds).  Fuel economy can be an issue.  On the highway, I got a nice 30+ MPG, but in the city, barely 20.  I have the lowest end model, and I am impressed with the amount of extras it came with, as well as the performance of the engine.  Very peppy for a 4 cyl.  All in all, I am very satisfied with this car.","Engine performance, overall design, excellent brakes, lots of extras that come standard.  Nice acceleration for a 4-cyl.  Superb handling.  Copious amounts of room.  Very accommodating seatbelts for larger people.","Transmission can be a little choppy until you get used to driving it.  Mileage varies too much between city and highway.  Hate having to program the dome lights to go on when the door opens instead of just having them go on.  Trunk/gas release are on the floor, which is awkward.  HUGE gas tank (18)."

Nevertheless, there are some poor quality issues related to details, such as loose door panels, seats springs noise, and paint scratches in the bumpers.

Now I don't even notice it. This car is powerful and I have a lot of fun driving it. I actually look forward to my 30 mile commute each day. A lot of people complain about the seats.

Apparently I should have done some more research. The squealing brakes after less than 5000 kms are completely unacceptable. I would never recommend purchasing the 08/09 models to anyone.

The top of the line trim comes at a great price for all of the features and the quality (and it looks better than the cheaper trims, too).  Lastly, for a coupe, it's large enough that you're comfortable.  I just ask anyone considering this car to test drive it. If it's for you, you'll know it.","1) Beautiful styling.  The car looks like an Acura, putting competitors like the Nissan Altima coupe to shame. 2) Performance.  The V6 handles well in snow and rain, and is fast. 3) Comfort.  The car is big enough to not make you feel squished, and the high quality of the interior is superb.","At 4,000 miles, I had to replace the break pads.  Honda's warranty took care of the cost, but it was a nuisance. Something about the change of seasons causing them to harden and squeal.  That shouldn't happen with a new car."

The ride is just a step below the Acura TL, the gas economy for a v6 is wonderful, especially balanced against the power and acceleration the engine provides.  The only bad thing I can say about  the seats is that they are not quite as supportive as those in the Acura TL.  Let me tell you, if you want the same equipment in a Taurus or an Avalon or Lincoln you will need another $7,000.00 so do yourself a favor and put the extra money in your pocket and seriously consider this car.","navi, eco engine feature, gas economy and back seat room",Offer Acura TL driver seat as a top- end option with EX-L.

Road noise can be solved with different tires such as the Bridgestone Turanza Serenity tires that I have on my 04. They are extremely quiet! However front seat comfort is another story. There is too little cushioning and the side bolsters are too extreme! The driver's seat is a bit better because of the 8- way power adjustment which allows the seat cushion itself to be raised or lowered and angled flat if need be. The passenger seat with just a 4-way adjustment does not allow this. Honda needs to immediately fix this problem with an 8-way power passenger seat.","Navigation system, brakes and build quality.",Change from Michelin tires to Bridgestone Turanza Serenity tires.

I have had just about every issue discussed...brakes,  tires, handle, lights, mileage and additionally the tube to the exhaust came off so my vehicle sounded like a race car for a bit!  How embarrassing!  The worst part about it is the issues are not one time they happen over and over again.  The dealership said ""there was no recall"" and that they could only fix with what Honda sends them.  So, I called Honda directly and they responded by saying ""there is no recall on the vehicle"".  Unbelievable.  I believe both dealership and Honda Corp. are in denial and don't want to spend the money or invest the time to make it right.","The body style is alright but think rear is too high.

Too bad for us that we found out that there are some build quality issues that, while not life threatening, are annoying nonetheless on a new car. These include such things as squealing brakes, adhesive protruding out behind plastic panels, and loose rear view mirror.  Our manual transmission also is not as smooth as we've been accustomed too.  We will be taking it into the dealership to see if we can get any of these issues taken care of.

In addition to my post on 04/26/09 I'd have to add more bad news. In addition to the gripes I have with the car the list grows still larger. The seats are the worst seats in any car I've owned and I've once owned a Yugo when I was a lad so I know a bad seat when I feel one. Also the Brake discs are now warped and feel that ""judder"" one feels when you brake. I have had many cars but never one that had just 7,000 miles on it that felt this old so fast.

But now the inside is bugging me, the arm rest looks like junk, the leather is bubbling up really, really bad. Soon it's going to all become lifted off.

Gas mileage is around 25mpg with mostly highway driving, that to I drive at 55-60mph. In comparison my 2003 Impala V6 cylinder was giving much better mileage than this 09 Accord, 4 cyl!!

Then at 2000 miles the brakes have started to make a grinding noise, oh and I've noticed a vibrating sound coming from the dash (which I hit with my hand to stop), not to mention the loud clicking the CD player makes.

After the fifth visit, the dealership admitted that Honda knows about this problem; apparently Honda has a Tech Line stating FRONT BRAKE SQUEAL and PREMATURE REAR PAD WEAR on 2008-09 Accord and Accord V6. In addition, I have problems with different buttons squeaking & the only thing they have done is spray oil on them. I have contacted Honda for help, nevertheless, nothing has happened they are claiming Honda ENGINEERS are working on the brake problem (almost 2 years) & they are not willing to make an attempt to fix it by replacing the pads.

The problems other posters have mentioned, are definitely there though. First, the uncomfortable seats. Yes, I see what everyone means. I did end up buying a $12 seat cushion from Walmart that has made a difference. Seats aren't the best for long drives. Second, the ""ECO"" function, with switching from 6 to 4 cylinders is a little annoying as well. You have to learn how to optimize the accelerator pedal to minimize this. Navigation not as good as Lexus RX350, but I'm still learning it. Voice recognition not all that.  Otherwise, I like the car, the look.

Actually a customer was right behind complaining about her brakes too. Seats felt like they were made from steel or something because my backside fell asleep every time I drove more then 30 miles.

I have never had this experience in over 35 years of car ownership!  Also don't like rear visibility.  Can't see objects in rear quarter, and hard to tell where the rear bumper is in parking.

Honda Customer Service told me that they cannot do anything for me at this time as the seats and headrest are designed to safety regulations and if they have a recall, they would let me know.

Love everything, but I have to agree with several other reviewers that the driver's seat is often downright uncomfortable -- I'm a 5'6"" female and the seat back hits me in the wrong place, throwing me into a very unnatural position. Putting on the lumbar makes matters worse. I'm hoping the seat softens up and takes on the arm-chair cushiness of my 2006 Accord.

Car has many extra features that are add-ons on the other cars. Car is black on black and it turns heads. Wasn't a big fan of the sedan design (little too big), but love the coupe.

4.5,What you would expect,Doug Atkins ,02/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"This is my 5th new Honda.  I owned an Accord in 2003 and gave it up when my company offered me a company car in 2007.  They gave me a Toyota Camry LE V6. The V6 Camry had loads of power.  Got decent gas mileage as well.  For some reason, I really missed my 2003 Accord LX (4 cylinder).  The Honda was just put together better.  I could tell the Camry was a mass production car.  The floor carpeting came in several places, some of the plastic molding wasn't fit together very well, etc.  Bought a new 2009 Accord EX-L (4 cylinder) to replace it.  Fit and finish is superior like a remembered it and everything is laid out within easy reach and makes sense.  Relatively noise free, ride is very stiff.","Center console (don't get the navigation system unless you want to drive a starship), view and lack of blind spots, quiet, BLUETOOTH rocks!  It actually works!  Must have accessory.",I was disappointed that the EX-L didn't have the full blown computer information system that is on my wife's 08 Odyssey.  It tells her gas mileage and automatically resets after fueling plus a bunch of other things.  The EX-L only has outside temperature gauge and oil life.

The Accord's handling and road manners are impeccable. Interior is roomy and very ergonomic. The engine is very responsive  and smooth for a 4 cyl. Gas mileage is pretty good (currently getting 23 city/ 30 highway). Road noise is higher than other sedans in this class but not horrible. I expect that when I eventually replace the OEM Dunlops that road noise and handling will both improve. Trunk is not huge but big enough.

They've all been extremely reliable and safe cars but they've also been like vanilla ice cream when it comes to looking at them.  They've all had the features we've wanted and most of them have been loaded.  But until this new design, none of them have been very exciting.  This car is gorgeous!!

Inside comfort has been less than desirable especially for longer drive periods and I feel less spacious than I thought when I test drove it.

It seemed to offer a reasonable compromise between fuel economy and sporty styling.  The ride/drive was uninspiring until adding after market 18 inch wheels and 245/40/18"" tires which made the car a much more enjoyable vehicle in most all respects, primarily due to the reduction in unsprung weight (check the weight of the factory wheel tire combo).

I am still trying to get used to the headlight flicker that occurs at night. Not sure what is causing that, but it is not that big of an issue.  The one big issue that I am experiencing has to do with the driver's seat.  The seatback has a pronounced lumbar support that ""forces"" your back into an S.

4.5,4-cyl with a kick,Vic ,11/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,3,5,4,"Now that I have 3k miles on the car, I want to share my experience.  I have a LX-S 4cyl model, in white. After the first month of ownership, I took the car for a weekend trip to central coast, CA (est. 600 miles).  For a 4cyl, it has excellent acceleration (kinda reminded me of my 2002 Lexus IS, but not quite).  It is very roomy and very stylist. The ride is a bit rougher than the Camry.  The seats are a bit uncomfortable.  Mechanic is good.  Steering wheel does not vibrate like other 4cyl. Fuel to power ratio is excellent, maybe the best in its class. It would be much more fun to drive, if it had rear-wheel drive.","Love the 190 hp, 4 cyl. Fuel consumption was as much as a 165 hp car.  Interior and trunk space were very roomy.","The LX-S driver seat was very uncomfortable. I definitely recommend getting the EX-L (has more position adjustments). Front and rear visibility could be a challenge for drivers 5'2"" and under.  "

Every three years my lease is up and I try hard to stray away but fortunately every 3 years I make the right choice. This Honda is bigger than the Altima, Camry, Hyundai and just about as big as the BMW 5 series sedan.  There is just enough of what you need here, and still remains very competitive in price and quality.  I am happy with the interior quality, I am happy with the drive, and this is overall a very classy reliable car so far!","I enjoy the aux port, std 17 inch wheels on all EX and above models, and the handling, but most of all this is one quiet interior wise vehicle.  I think that while all the above is fun to talk about the STANDARD safety features are key.","Considering there is always going to be something we could improve to fit our respective lifestyles, I have owned a few Hondas over the past 9 years and honestly the fact that Honda puts the controls in the same general area every year doesn't complicate things.  Perhaps Xenon headlights!"
5,Best Full-Size Car ,William ,11/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my wife a 2009, Accord, EX-L, nav, with every option. We love the car. The car has Lexus and Infiniti styling at a fraction of the cost.  More room than the M-series, and better mileage. This is our fourth Accord, and is our first leather Accord. The back seat room is incredibly large, and our sons are 6'2"" and 6'4"".  Their legs don't touch the front seat. This is the best Accord that Honda has ever made.

For three thousand more than the Civic it is a no brainer. I love it. ,"The smooth acceleration, handling, It feels as if I am driving a Benz.

Although the EX has 190 HP, I think it drives fast and smooth.  I'm having lots of fun driving this baby around.  Although there's lots more buttons on the console, I found it easy to navigate.  A lot of people complain about the road noise, but I have no problem with it, and I ain't going deaf.","I love that I can hook up my MP3 player as an auxiliary device (no more FM tuner)! It's very roomy, and I love those 17 inch alloy wheels.  The overall shape of the vehicle makes me feel like I'm driving an expensive luxury vehicle.","I wish it had lumbar support on the seats, like my 06 sedan did.  That support made all the difference in my comfort."
4,Redheaded Stepchild,Paul Beetz ,10/30/2008,,,5,5,1,1,,5,5,5,5,"I bought a new 2009 Honda Accord in Omaha NE. Gave it to my daughter for her birthday and She took it to college in San Antonio. The seat will not lock in 2 o'clock position well and sometimes just drops back while driving; and the brakes squeal, all before 2,000 miles. She took to Gunn Honda in San Antonio and they said the brake noise was from vibration (duh) and wouldn't fix it. The seat wouldn't misbehave at that time. I don't blame the original dealer. Honda Customer Service was not helpful and tried to tell me the seat dropping back was a feature. My initial impression is that the car is of poor quality and that Honda will not fix it. All this in under 2,000 miles.","The original dealer was great to work with and a 2008 Fit Sport has been trouble free. The 2009 Accord appeared to be a great car too, until the above mentioned safety problems soured the whole deal.",Own their mistakes and fix them. In my wildest dreams I never expected Honda to not take care of these problems. I am an attorney and am considering a class action lawsuit as this is a safety issue and the original dealer said other new Accords on the lot also have the same seat problem. Beware. 
4.5,Great upgrade from Civic,Mychal ,10/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"Just purchased the 2009 Honda Accord EXL.  What an upgrade from the 2006 Civic EX that I had.  Being the 4th Honda I've owned I'm definitely a loyal Honda owner and the newest Accord reaffirms my loyalty.  Great styling, handling and features for the price.  I highly recommend any Honda, but especially the Accord. ","Safety features, color, and fuel economy",Less road noise
5,Very Impressed,Sherrie Bigelow ,10/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just purchased the 2009 Accord v-6 w/ navigation. Looked at all other cars in this class, felt that the Honda offered me the best all around in terms of performance, reliability and cost.","Love the exterior look since redesign in 2008, has a more upscale look to it and wider stance in the wheels.","One major complaint to Honda..I had NO idea the the navigation system did NOT have a rear back-up camera! Found out after purchase this is a rather expensive OPTION!  I was VERY disappointed! My husband owns the Pilot w/ Nav and has a camera, so does the new CR-V. Honda should add that! "
5,Grand car for all ,Nic ,10/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Couldn't decide if I wanted the Audi A5 or this the price was holding me back but I figured I would let the car sell itself I am young at 22 and need a car that can fit my needs and is practical without breaking the bank. The Honda Accord is just this it is very impressive and sleek. I recommend this car to anyone around my age. The coupe that is. Read the safety reports received perfect for front side impact that is something that is very important to me. ,Voice command system leaves you feeling as your the boss with the constant ah of the passengers trying to figure out how the temp. just changed by your voice. Navigation works wonders as does the easy Ipod and XM radio access. ,The navigation could be a little easier or quicker to operate I feel that they is room for improvement I suppose we will see but as far as how it holds against other Nav systems among the top. 
5,Good overall vehicle,PCPostman ,10/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"As previous Honda van owners, I felt we couldn't go wrong with the Accord when I needed to upgrade my 12-year old car. Has good pick-up from start and when on the highway and can get up to triple digits if necessary. I've had no issues with it in the first 10 months of ownership, which is what I expected. Want more speed and features? Step up to the EX/V6. Want good, reliable, safe, basic transportation? Kind of hard to go wrong with the Accord.","Remote auto-down windows is great when car has been sitting out in hot sun all day. Sliding middle console gives good position for right elbow. Highway mileage is off the charts, averaging between 32-36.",Move AUX input higher up in center console or move to dash for ease of access; higher quality console cover and carpet mats. Both see a lot of use and shouldn't start looking rough after just 6500 miles in 10 months.
4.875,Love it.,cpriest ,10/19/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this car earlier this month and absolutely love it. I did a LOT of research on 2009 sedans (including Camry, Accord, Jetta, and Altima) before deciding on the Accord. The Accord is top-notch As soon as you get in it you feel like you are sitting in a luxury car that should be much more expensive than a Honda. And performance is great! I am very pleased with the car...except for 1 thing---the headlights dim just a bit about every 15-20 seconds when the AC is on. The only reason I noticed it was because I was looking for it (I had read about it in some of the reviews). However, this is not a big enough problem to keep me from loving my car!! Honda's reliability is excellent.","exterior color (Platinum Gray Metallic), interior design, plenty of room, good stereo, steering wheel audio controls, iPod auxiliary jack, smooth ride",the only thing I do not like about the car is the headlight issue but I have a feeling Honda will be coming up with a solution for that very soon.
4.125,Could use interior design improvements,Too much plastic ,10/18/2008,,,3,5,3,5,,5,4,4,4,Drives and handles well.  The TPMS (tire pressure monitoring system) light came on the second day I had the car and no matter how I tweak the tire pressure it won't go off (common problem). I assume this may have something to do with side airbags but the sun visors are poorly designed & are not long enough on both the right and left sides leaving gaps for sun glare. The center stereo console is too big & you need pretty long arms to reach the right side buttons comfortably. It's like they just made the buttons bigger and spaced them out to fill up space. The steering wheel has cheap plastic silver pieces in the center that I cannot believe they used. Plastic wheel covers are very cheap.  ,"Interior room, trunk space, fold down rear seat, body styling.  Affordable.",Space center console buttons for stereo closer together.  Use a lot less plastic.  Sun visors needs extensions or need to be longer. Driver seat could use more lumbar support or lumbar adjustment feature.  Should eliminate the LX-S version and make the power driver seat a standard feature in the LX.
4.5,Sexiest Honda ever,Normgarry ,10/13/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"I wrote a full review about this car here on Epinions under the name Bigtruckseries.  The Coupe is VERY sexy, very sporty and for less than $34,000 loaded, it gives a great sense of having more without having paid more.  The seats are comfortable if you are a short person but the tall won't like it as much.  The V6 is the best model, with plenty of ZIP for city cruising while the 190 HP I4 doesn't disappoint those with no need to speed.  Good steering Bad body roll Plasticky interior   The major downside is a cluttered center stack, poor user interface in the Navigation system and terrible voice controls that can accidentally change the temperature before doing what they should.",Navigation system is a must have in my opinion if you plan to own this car more than 5 years.  I'd also suggest the auto-start alarm system in the Sentry 2000 to keep people from stealing it. My girlfriend got her's free.,"Higher quality buttons for the entire car as well as a redesigned, simpler to use Navigation system with a better GUI and better voice controls would be a good start.    I suggest Honda makes the car a little longer for more leg space. "
4.5,"Good, not great",Aaron in IL ,10/11/2008,,,4,5,3,5,,5,4,5,5,"This is my first and probably only Honda. This was a want vs. need purchase.  Coolest style V6 coupe w/o nav at under $30k MSRP (paid $26950) is main reason I chose this model.  Good pickup, quiet motor and interior.  Love the standard ipod adapter but the subwoofer is substandard!  The trunk lid needs alignment, one speaker was bad, the passenger front seat needed to be tightened and there are two very visible paint blemishes on the pillar above the driver mirror all which were noted for correction by the dealer at delivery. Having said that, I feel the final factory pre-ship inspection was poor and I hope for better days ahead having driven only 600 miles.  23.5 overall mpg so far.","Hot, hot style by far, engine smoothness, steering response, driver leg room and rear seat room very accommodating, perfect location for the standard ipod plug-in as well as it's own 12v plug right there","Passenger front seat quality poor and should be power.  Lose the 'ECO' blinky light, it's aggravating!  Fewer A/C and stereo controls would be nicer.  Honda trademark road noise STILL there!

My new car was bought after much detailed and painstaking research. Issues with past Accords that kept me away: Road noise, stiffness of ride, high price, arrogant dealerships. I got lucky by finding a good dealer that gave me good value on 05 Camry. Camrys started to have an issue with valves rattling (70K miles!), so I may have had a lemon. It was a refined vehicle, and the ride in my new Honda is a only a touch louder and harsher, . But I get better mileage, more agile, new  suspension is wonderful.

The extra 2 grand gets you better looking wheels, Homelink, fog lights, integrated spoiler, dual exhaust, and some other small odds n ends make it worth the cost (since I would have wanted to upgrade the wheels and put fogs on the I4). The V6 also provides a great amount of power, but the I4 will suffice for most and is sufficient. I only wish that the 6MT had a taller 6th gear. I get the EPA rated 26 mpg, but I'm sure it could be better with a taller final drive while still being fast on the low end. ","Standard fogs, 18"" wheels, overall look, excellent fit and finish, V6 coupled with the sporty 6-speed tranny.","Make the passenger seat back heated (it isn't because of some side airbag stuff), make the 6th gear taller for better fuel economy, revise the radio to make the volume knob the larger knob.

The best was Honda Accord. It's got luxury, power, attractiveness, and even comfort.  The V6 EX L is not cheap. I ended up paying over $31,000 after taxes and fees but it's been well worth it.
