5,Best car ever!,Dan Melody ,05/25/2016,5,5,4,,,5,5,5,3,,,"I bought this car in 2009. With the cash for clunkers rebate and other discounts it was 7,800 out the door. I changed the required items and maintenance at 100,000 .  At 200,000 I replaced the water pump, thermostat , timing belt, hoses and spark plugs. Oh yes, brakes at 150,000 and three sets of tires. This was the most basic model, stick shift and roll up windows. Best car I've ever owned!",,
2,"Died at 99,200 miles!",Angela Wakhweya ,04/05/2016,2,,2,,,2,2,2,2,,,"I bought it new. It ran efficiently for six years...I was about to celebrate it's 100,000 mile birthday when the timing belt shredded and killed my whole engine...after one year of no car payments, is it worth the grief now...",,
4,My thoughts,MrSilver ,02/19/2016,3,4,4,,,5,4,4,4,,,"I've owned the car for over 2 years now.  I bought it used with ~52k miles on it back in the fall of '13.  It is the SE with all the options and a MT.  I just turned over 80k miles this month.  What I like: For a hatchback, it looks kinda neat.  I like the tail lights and the stubby spoiler.  The cloth interior is nice, it's the charcoal with rough texture and that's right up my alley.  For a 110 HP engine, it sure feels like more, so I've been alright with the power, even though I'm accustomed to more powerful vehicles (200 HP Taurus, 220 HP Eclipse GSX).  I like the amount of space in the engine bay for repairs and maintenance.  The engine has the capability of going into high RPMs.  I like the hatchback and the cargo area, especially with the rubber floor mat.  Liked the Sirius XM radio.  I've never had the car break down on me or leave me stranded or fail to start.  Things that I like less:5th gear really really needed to be longer.  I run on the freeway to commute, and at 70 MPH, the engine is at ~3,500 RPM.  How great the MPG could have been if the final gear left me at 2,000-2,200 RPM!  I had the same complaint with my Eclipse GSX.  These engineers really need to lengthen the final gear, it's not for acceleration, it's for cruising!  Unfortunately, the MPG is not what I expected out of a car this size.  I expected 34-35 MPG but average somewhere just under 30 MPG.  The tires.  Oh my the tires.  Firstly, why a tiny hatchback comes with 16"" rims is beyond me.  You feel every bump with these low profile tires, and let me tell you, they are easy to pop!  Lost one along with a dented rim in a pothole.  Lost a second on a gravel country road.  These are simply not made to be durable or comfortable.  To add the cherry on the top, tire shops do not stock this size!  Blow a tire?  Guess you're waiting a day or two for your size to come in!  Do yourself a favor and ""upgrade"" to the stock 14"" rims off a GS and put normal tires on it with a higher sidewall.  Squeaky clutch pedal.  Don't know how to fix it, it's always squeaked.  Asked the dealership to lube it or something, they couldn't fix it.  Cheap dashboard that's guaranteed to scratch.  Seems to be the industry standard these days.Sirius XM will mail you to get you to sign up.  Seems like the little birdies told them I bought a car equipped with XM radio.  Did not appreciate that.Car feels like a kite in the wind.  You will fight the gusts and be tossed about on the highway.  I honestly contemplate how I can add extra aerodynamic enhancements to keep this thing grounded in the wind.  It's so low to the ground already, how is it this bad?It's low to the ground.  As in, you can't use normal ramps to change your oil.  I mean, you can, but you will certainly scuff up your front bumper cover.  And after numerous times of doing that, it will eventually crack. The suspension.  Dear me, even worse than the rim/tire fiasco.  These cars are notorious for having suspension components that wear out far too rapidly.  Be prepared to listen to the lovely sound of popcorn being made for the life of this car.  Sway bar end links.  Tie rod ends.  Ball joints.  Shocks/struts.  It's all garbage, and it all needs to be replaced at least once (or more) under 80k miles.  Some say Moog aftermarket will help.  Metal shift knob is heavy and looks good, but it gets HOT in the summer and COLD in the winter.  Watch out for both.Sun visors - utter garbage.  Work well until they simply break.  Want to get a replacement? OK, $80.  Great...The sound system is very 'meh'.  Almost no bass.Back seat latch rattles anyone?  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about...Depreciation.  WOW that is a killer.  This car lost $6-7K value in the 2 years I've owned it.  Ouch.  I thought with the gas prices being high that the need for small, economical hatchbacks would be worth something to somebody.  Nah, gas came down.  Looks like dealer trade in is only around $3,500 now.  Almost pays to just keep it and drive it into the ground.  With all the nit-picky things, I still think it's a decent car.  If I bought a Hyundai again, I would opt for a slightly higher make.",,
4.5,This is a great car,ggracchus ,09/06/2014,,,5,5,5,5,,3,4,5,4,"Of course it gets great MPG and is reliable.   Our favorite thing about it, though, may seem a bit odd -- it is that it has a button that permits air recirculation for the fan, heater and AC.   You may think this is common, but the difference is that once you set it to recirculate instead of pull air from the outside, it STAYS ON.   Other vehicles will do an override, like our Ford, that will shut it off.  Those types of vehicles think they are smarter than you are, and if the humidity or whatever gets to a certain level, off it goes.   We really, really hate breathing pollution from the cars in front of us -- the fan will pull it right from their exhaust pipe into your face.  ","Great MPG
Reliable
Allows recirculation of air with no automatic override","Performance is not the best, but that is expected with these small engines.   With 5 speed it is not too bad, but maybe steal some ideas from Honda's vtec engines."
4.125,"I love this car, 50MPG is easily attainable. ",drunkenrobot ,07/29/2014,,,3,3,5,5,,4,3,5,5,"I have had this car from new. It has been exceptionally reliable. I've never had a problem with it. I average 40-50 MPG on the highway and 30-40 MPG in the city. It is very fuel efficient for the price. My only issues that the seats are a bit uncomfortable on very long trips. I drive for two days each way to my summer vacation spot, and my back hurts after each run. Two doors was enough when I bought it, but limber passengers are a requirement to get into the back, though there is plenty of legroom back there. With the back seats down, the cargo area is enormous, we have shoved mountains of stuff in there. 100K on it so far, no issues.","The SE has power everything, which is a bonus. The stiffer springs make it handle like a go kart. It has more than enough power for getting around town, passing, and highway cruising. The automatics gets slightly better fuel economy, but the manual is just so fun, and it feels a lot more peppy than the auto. The cabin air filter is a nice bonus. The A/C nearly freezes me to death every summer, and the a/c assisted defogger works amazingly well. It regularly drops to -40 around here in the winter, it starts every time, and warms up fast.","The stock tires are terrible in the winter, I drive on winter tires anyway, so it's not really an issue. The stock stereo is also terrible, if you are a music lover, replace the head unit and the speakers asap. The gearbox is a bit notchy, switching to synthetic GL4 gear oil helps with that. The rear drum brakes aren't especially pretty (but they are reliable, inexpensive and last forever, so I don't mind too much). "
2.25,Bad Mileage,jeniferlw ,08/15/2013,,,2,2,3,1,,3,3,2,2,"I bought the car used a little over 2 years ago. It had high mileage but the price was right and I trusted the Hyundai brand. Boy was I wrong. The car functioned fairly well for the first 2 years, I was getting the street mileage ( 26 mpg) but was no where close to the highway mileage (35 mpg). Then in April my mileage suddenly dropped. Since then I now average 20 mpg, which is 200 miles per tank. Basically I can no longer afford to drive the car. I contacted Hyundai who told me to take it to their service dept. I have spent over $500 to try and figure out the issue. The only thing left to try is the fuel consumption test, which I am saving up for. ",,
5,Wonderful car!,margarets_dad ,06/11/2013,4,3,4,,,5,,4,4,,,"Bought this car used with 42,500 miles, and have put on another 5,000. This is a fantastic car for the city--very durable and fits into the parking spaces that are too small for everyone else. The car drives very nicely, and has a substantial feel for its size. Its handling is excellent, and although it doesn't have a huge amount of power (how much do you really need anyway, unless you're in the Indy 500?), the engine is very peppy with the manual transmission and it has more than enough oomph for day-to-day driving. Depreciation on Hyundais is still pretty bad (undeservedly so), which is bad for the original owner, but great if you want to get a high-quality used car at a great price. UPDATE: After 50,000 very tough New York City miles (now up to 93,000), I'm still very happy with the car. Have been averaging over 34 mpg mixed city and highway driving. Very durable and reliable, and maintenance, tires, and other parts are inexpensive. Only repair needed at this point has been the replacement of a sway-bar link (around $200).",,
4.625,Amazing car,highmiles9 ,12/30/2012,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"I have owned this car for 3 years now and 170,000kms. Its been great. I tow a trailer with it and it will tow a small trailers with ease. I have done nothing to this car over the time ownership. I have done two sway bar links. 2 ignition coils under warranty. One blower motor, and anti theft module, connector and ignition antenna ring. Other then that just maintenance i haven't even worn through the brakes yet. This car is fun to drive with the factory 16"" wheels it takes a corner fast. I'm tall and this car fits me well and gets great gas millage. This car was almost half the price of Japanese competitor but wayyy better.","The reliability is amazing. 
Its roomy even in the back seat 2dr.
Simple and well layed out controls.
Easy to drive.
Good looking car. 
Fit and finish is better then some high end cars i have been in.
Purchase price. All options other than automatic trans for the gs sport under 18000 cnd out the door. Brand new not a demo. Had 7km on it when i bought it.","Although the car is overall very nice there is a couple of things.
ABS would be a nice option. 
Cruise control was not available and wish it was. Engine could use a little more power 10-20hp. Rated a 130hp @ 6000rpm.
Its ok but when a/c on you must plan your lane changes carefully.
Dealing with Hyundai for warranty is a nightmare. Hyundai is very stingy, my blower motor was squeaking when on and i brought it in and they declined the repair because it was still working. Eventually the motor stopped working and i had to change it at my cost. Thank goodness overall its a quality car. I would still buy a Hyundai because the car works with bare bone upkeep. "

The only problem is:gas mileage not fitting this car, 25 to 27 overall is not very good, no overdrive, it is simply a fifth gear.

Ellis ,11/18/2010,,,2,1,2,3,,3,2,2,2,"Elimination of the rear wiper and the addition of the rear spoiler make it impossible to see out the rear window when it is raining or snowing when you are driving. This is a significant safety issue.  Why include XM Radio when OnStar would make more sense?  The rear spoiler is noisy, particularly when the wind is blowing.  Tire wear continues to be a problem. I have had difficulty with tire wear on all of the Hyundai vehicles I have owned.  I have been disappointed in the gas mileage. I got better mileage with my Elantra. The small size of the gas tank is also a disappointment.",,Put rear wiper on all models.  Do away with the rear spoiler.  Increase size of gas tank.  Do not put XM Radio in cars as a standard feature. It is too expensive to continue subscribing.

Car is a blast to drive. only 2500lbs, short-ratio tranny, and 110HP makes it pretty fast.

5,Perfect car,fred ,08/26/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded in a 2005 Accent (that I bought new also) on this car a year ago. This car is even better than the 2005 was.

At first glance, I really enjoyed the dark blue color which made the Accent a handsome car. My renter didn't have many options, just a CD player, AC and automatic transmission. But the CD player was impressive.  For something that's sticker price tops out in the 13k range, I was quite surprised with a few things like quietness, bump absorption, pickup and handling that rivaled cars outside of its price class. My only real gripe was its lack of ABS. I had to do a panic stop in the rain and I wasn't sure if I was going to stop in time. ","CD Player, fuel economy, quite ride and zippy handling. ","Add ABS to the brakes, having a car in 2010 without them is pretty ridiculous. The nosedive when you slam on the brakes only makes it worse. The reach for the radio and the AC is a little far. "
4.125,"Good, but with Issues",Dave ,08/06/2010,,,5,4,4,4,,3,5,3,5,"I bought my Accent a few months ago and I really like driving it more and more each day I get in it.  The car is loaded with features.  The issues I have are: 1) the cruise control hesitates when first set, 2) the tranny downshifts at the slightest incline (at some interstate overpasses at 78 mph and at some bridges at 35 MPG, I never know when it may downshift), 3) it spits out gas at the end of every fill-up no matter how slow I fill it, and 4) I am a very slow driver (everyone passes me off the start), but I only get 25 MPG in town and 30 MPG at 75 mph on the freeway.

Other than that, i love it. its so fun to drive, and i like the way the gears click into place and how easy the clutch is. i do wish it had cruise control and power locks, but it's the base model and was cheap.

We knew the day was coming, so we has already been researching vehicles, and the combination of price features, and warranty put the Accent at the top of  the list.

The engine, wgile no speed demon, etc the job done, even at 80 MPH plus highway cruising. Don't let the lack of ABS scare you if you are looking at the Accent, the car stops just fine.

4.375,Do yourself a favour...,CWR ,03/04/2010,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,5,4," Do yourself a favor and upgrade to the ABS on the GLS model, especially if you drive in snow or a lot of wet conditions. Considering the price point of these vehicles, it is well worth the investment for the safety of ABS brakes. I was used to the system in a '04 Civic (much better braking system to be sure), and almost paid the ultimate price when I spun out a few times this winter in the Accent GLS w/out ABS. Hyundai should really make ABS standard on all models. Apart from this legitimate beef, it's a great little car for the money, far more room inside than Civic. Nice fittings inside, lots of leg room up front, highly capable engine for size of car. Excellent gas mileage all around.","Gas mileage, fit is simple and clean inside, more leg room than you expect up front, stereo is good, nimble and easy to park around town.  Not that expensive to fix, and a great warranty in case you do have to fix it.","Gotta make the ABS standard on all models. Can't believe they would cheap out on this feature these days (it's 2010).

5,Accidentally Got The Best,Happy Hyundai Owner ,12/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the Base 09 Accent Coupe because it was half the cost of my 1st choice, the Honda Fit. However, the longer I drive the Accent, the more I feel it's the best choice I could've made.  I've even come to love the apple green color.  It has an amazing amount of room inside - I went from a GMC Jimmy and have had little trouble adapting, space-wise.  The exterior design is simple, clean and well- proportioned; I think it's one of the best-looking cars on the road.  It handles and drives like a sports car, feels like an extension of my body: I think, it responds.  Very solid, well- made car, reminds me of an MGB-GT I once had (without the constant repairs!).","Extremely roomy - my skis & 1-piece kayak paddle easily fit inside.  With the 5-speed manual tranny, superb handling and responsive steering, it's like driving a sports car.  Zoom zoom, zip zip zip!  Great mileage, a huge plus after my GMC Jimmy.  Handles GREAT in the snow, even w/o snow tires!","Manual tranny s/b geared higher; highway RPMs are 3500-4000, s/b 2000- 2500.  Needs more ground clearance, esp. in front.

5,Better than expected,W. Henry ,11/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"4 months of usage and the first 4,737 miles used 122.75 gallons of gas for 38.59mpg and I had to round for the JD Powers survey so it rounded to 39mpg. Course, I only use the first quarter inch on the gas pedal and park behind the slow moving trucks on the freeway. I think this is the least expensive car sold in America and to get 39mpg--this car is a steal.  My son thinks that Korea is building the best cars for the price just like the Japanese companies did when they first started.  They are trying harder.  I'm not just comparing it to my last car, a 1981 Rabbit diesel, but also w rental cars such as the sporty Cadillac and a Mercedes that I owned in 1970. I didn't get AC.         ","A very solid car that I feel quite safe in, even tho it is a small car.  I also use it like a small pick-up transporting farm equipment and materiel and I'm sure glad I purchased the Accent instead of a small pick-up since the car holds almost as much and can also be locked.    ",I've only used the brakes hard once and was going about 5 or 10mph and they sounded metallic and the front end really dipped so there is a little worry that the brakes may not be as good as the gas mileage.

I'm so glad I did, because I really couldn't decide between the 10 cars I had on my list. There was always something wrong, or missing.   Either the price was too high, or the warranty too short, or I just couldn't fall in love with the car's styling.    I had never considered a subcompact, but reluctantly started looking at them.   I was intrigued with the Accent SE.   It had a lot of nice features, and was sporty to boot.  It's so much fun to drive, and has been solid and comfortable.   This car gets many looks in traffic, from all angles, by drivers slyly checking it out.  It is very sharp in Ebony black, and stands out.","The styling, the hatch, the automatic light features, alloy rims, satellite radio, and the performance.","Could use a sixth gear, for high-speed freeway driving.   Up to 70 it's fine, but there is a little engine noise as you go faster than that.   I just turn up the satellite radio a little, and it's easily covered up."
4.875,FIRST BRAND NEW CAR,TOM FROM PA ,11/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Just purchased vehicle through a chain of dealerships I work for.  I was looking at the Hyundai accent, the Suzuki sx-4, and the Nissan versa.  I loved the accent's looks and all the features it had for the money.  The versa and sx-4 where way more money for a comparably equipped car.  The only thing they had on the accent was more room (but they are four doors) and the Suzuki has all wheel drive.  The performance in all three cars was almost identical, but in the end the car with the better looks and the better warranty won me over.  I have owned it for less than a week and have put 1000 miles on it.  I can't get over this car.  I smile every time I get in it.  No buyers remorse here!","XM radio, 16"" wheels, 176 Watt sound system, abs, that beautiful charcoal Gray paint, 60/40 seats, massive interior room for a two door hatch back, zippy acceleration","165 turbocharged horsepower, standard Cruise control, more aggressive performance options like lower suspension, bigger brakes, maybe a CVT with paddle shifters but then again thats pushing it."

4.625,Best Value out there!,Christopher ,10/18/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"I must admit i was a little skeptical about Hyundai at first. However, my dads 2004 elantra has 270,000 miles on it before the oil pump went and blew the engine. That said i decided for my job to get a el cheapo accent base, no ac, no radio (i installed one myself), and a 5 sp manual tranny. I only paid after tax title license $11,325 with a 20 yr powertrain warranty, yes a 20 yr, from Rick Case. I average 33-41 MPG per tank. Clutch is smooth, drivability is fun, and the best part of it is the price. I have 12000 miles on this car with no issues. I cant say enough about this little fun car, except I highly recommend this vehicle!","Fuel Economy,easy to park,easy to maintain. Overall the best bang for the buck.  It is also one less part to break. I use Mobile 1 OW-20 oil, with a Napa Gold filter and I change the oil every 7500 miles.",Produce the exact same vehicle with a diesel engine w\ a 6 sp manual gearbox. Also increase to fuel tank to 14 gallons. Maybe drop a hybrid motor in this model as well.
4.625,"Comfy, efficient, cute, SE is a good buy",thepod ,09/12/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I bought my Accent SE six weeks ago and have put 1900 miles on it since.  I was looking for efficiency, reliabiltiy, cargo space, and a little bit of cuteness.  I got all of that plus ABS, cruise, a decent stereo system with 3 months of XM included, a sunroof, and reasonably comfy seats.  As to be expectied, it's not monstrously powerful, but I can merge onto the freeway or climb a hill comfortably, albeit a bit noisily.  When not laboring in one of those situations, the engine runs quietly and smoothly.  It corners well, stops well and doesn't feel too mushy.  I would have preferred an MT, but the AT was in stock so I went for it.  Interior is laid out logically. Overall, a good value.","armrest on driver side, lighted vanity mirrors, extra compartments for sunglasses and stuff, low tire sensor, tilt steering, actual spare TIRE, sunroof, foglights, shiny paint. it's a very cute car - the low pro tires and wheels aren't bad.  i really love the apple green color.  i call it 'the pod'.","armrest on passenger side, center console, let rear seatbacks fold flat and flush, doors ding somewhat easily, interior plastics scratch somewhat easily, no height adjustment for seats, cupholders could be more conveniently located, hatch release from inside"
4.75,Good subcompact,JD ,09/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,Bought under cash for clunkers.  Was looking for inexpensive car with good fuel economy.  Got a surprisingly comfortable little car.  I don't think anyone could beat the bang for the buck.  ,Plenty of interior space,Could use a better armrest maybe a console.
5,Gas milage and pep too,Roger Rabbit ,08/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I can't really believe the gas we're getting! When the wife drives it she's getting 33-35 mpg in town! I get over 30. I was totally surprised when on a trip to Oregon, We averaged 39.8 mpg!! The car has all the warranty and with the factory rebate we only paid 12k.

4.75,Solid built and fun to drive.,mamitchell ,08/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"I purchased my Accent primarily for daily commute duties.  I have put about 1000 miles on car so far and it has been a pleasure to drive.  The soft suspension provides a comfortable ride.  Wind, suspension and engine noise are well controlled.  The 1.6L engine and automatic transmission provide adequate power for my needs.  The interior is roomy for the car size and looks nice for an economy car.  Gas mileage is ~26 mpg with only in town driving and 40+ mpg with pure freeway driving.    ",Gas mileage is good.  Interior layout is simple.  Smooth ride and quiet at cruise speeds.  Radio has XM service.  Arm rest.  Additional recline position for rear seat back(s).  After unlocking power door locks with remote the doors will relock after ~1 minute if you do not open a door.,Transmission upshifts for economy only. It would be nice to have an optional shift pattern setting to help acceleration when desired.  Not sure about paint quality?  Seat belts on 3 door hatchback are too far back behind seat to reach without stretching.  A seat belt hold on seat could fix issue.

I have a daughter and its very easy to get her in and out. 5 speed is deff. Fun and easy to shift. It is all I wanted and more in a car. I was going to get the tc but they didn't have any and I thought lets try here and I'm so happy I did. Also I have the blue tooth and its amazing =].

4.75,excellent buy...,Vinayak ,08/23/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Could not be more happier buying this car. Its very sturdy and holds very well on freeway about 70-80mph. Drives very well within city too. get about 28mpg within city and 30-32 mpg on highway (mostly because of no cruise control). Excellent second car to have. Very spacious too, can easily fit 4 people.",xm radio,automatic cruise control

This car is great for the money spent. LOVE the way it handles and I get 33mpg in mixed city/hwy driving. Can't beat that. Odd mix of features - has power windows, power locks, low tire pressure indicator, six airbags but no cruise control! Overall I can't complain - the warranty is great, too.

Traded in a piece of trash and got $4500 from Cash for Clunkers and $1500 Factory Incentive.  Sticker price was $16,184 (Dealer added $299 for tint) and I paid $9,060 (plus tax, title & license).   For $9,000 you can't beat it.  It's not fast off the line, but once you get going, it goes great.  It was almost hard to keep it at 75 on the freeway as it drove effortlessly at 80 and 85.  A 6 foot driver and 2 6 foot passengers in the back all had enough room, although the seats are not as soft and comfortable as a more expensive model.  You can't go wrong with this car if you can pick it up cheap.","Price, gas mileage",Cruise control
5,a true suprise,thrilled ,08/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this car for nothing more than fuel economy. I took a real leap of faith in that I only saw a picture because the dealer had none in inventory, also never test drove the car. When I picked it up it was more than I imagined, it had a great look both exterior and the interior was much better than I thought it would be. Seats and int. Color is beautiful stereo is fantastic XM is fantastic (3 months free ) car drives very well handles nicely and all for 8 out the door. Car has a desert pkg and all floor matsonly complaint is dealership refused to   give the $1.49 gas deal. This is a definate surprise never expected this car to be this good.

The front is just as roomy as my Yukon was and it is a lot more fun to drive. The mpg is fantastic and it looks good too. Going up steep hills can take some patients but it is a small 4 banger so what do you expect? for the money, it is a great buy and Hyundai is what Toyota used to be. You cant go wrong. Not a lot of extra features, but I knew that going into it. It is even easy to drive on the interstate with it. I have not owned it that long, but I like it more and more every day.","6 air bags standard, auxiliary jack, mpg, the body lines, interior is comfortable. very clean interior design.","You are buying a economy car, you cant expect a lot.

Needed a new car after wearing out a very good Subaru but did not want to pay the high price for another Subaru. Looked at Hyundai since they are affordable and reliable. Liked the styling of the Accent hatchback and the fact that it did not come with a bunch of gadgets that will eventually break. Test drove and immediately knew this was the car for me. Though not a Ferarri with acceleration it gets to speed well enough. The car is quiet and rides very well. You get a little suspension noise over large bumps but the ride is very stable. Get the A/C - it is nice and cold. Controls are well laid out and easy to reach. Surprisingly very roomy for a small car.,"Roominess, CD player with 3 months free XM (what a deal), ride and comfort.

Well, I came across the Hyundai Accent GLS and that was it. This car is nice, not cheap. I'm 6'4 and I fit just fine. Get one w/o a radio and install your own, all the wiring/speakers are already installed. Took me 20 minutes to put a great radio in. Keep up w/ the maintenance and the warranty won't let you down.

Controls easy to reach and operate.  I cannot find anything that I don't like about this vehicle!  I compared two other vehicles in the same class and in the end the Accent won out.

3.625,new GLS Accent 2009 manual,kisiel ,05/13/2009,,,3,5,3,4,,3,4,4,3,"I needed second car, so we decided to buy something small and fuel efficient. So the most important for me was fuel economy, I did not care about others ""comforts"". So after two months I have to admit economy is good, when I am not speeding (average 50 mph) accent is doing about 37 mpg!  I read editors review here on Edmunds and I knew that accent does not belong to demons of speed, but I am fine with this.  So car let say is ok, worth money I gave, but I would do more improvements: 1) put smaller engine (1.4l) so they will beat Toyota in fuel efficiency 2) I do not really like in this car gear stick is not smooth and is hard to change gear, Hyundai schould work on this in manuals.",fuel efficiency big trunk speakers system,smaller engine so improving yet fuel efficiency gear stick in manuals should move more smoothier

We wanted a fuel efficient car that would last well beyond the payments and this one was certainly a consideration for us. We wanted a car that was quiet and comfortable to drive. With a seat height that is higher than the competition's and very surprisingly fun to drive handling characteristics, this was the one liked the most.
