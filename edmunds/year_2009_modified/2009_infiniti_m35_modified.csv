5,Great Car,CA Wisc ,09/01/2016,4,4,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"If you want a handsome, well appointed, solid car that has bullet proof reliability, this is your car.  I traded in a 2006 that I had bought for 20K (in 2009) with 30 some K miles on it for a used 2009.  The dealership gave me 10K for the 2006 in trade value on a used car price of 17K.  The trade in was 5 years later with 109K miles on the car!  In all that time on the 2006, I blew a belt and replaced brakes (other than normal maintenance).  Have had the 2009 for a year plus, no issues aside from normal maintenance, still tight, no rattles, car now has 85K on it.  Rides slightly stiffer than my old 2006, but has a bit more horses and way better sound system/tech.  I am not a big Bose fan when it comes to automobiles, but this (upgraded) sound system with Center-point is outstanding.  Are there some things that could be better?  Yes, it could have another 100 horses, ride like a limo and corner like a Corvette.   But then it would be out of my price range.  Ok, road noise could be a little better, and I wish they had put the 7 speed in the X.   Other than that, I honestly don't know why there aren't a lot more of these on the road.  Heck of a car.",,
4.75,Near perfect balance between luxury and sport,autolover55 ,04/13/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Consumer Reports hit the nail on the head when they rated the M35 their #1 mid-size luxury/sport car. Bought a 2009 M35 w/ Nav & Tech pkg in Feb 2010 after my 2005 Honda Accord was destroyed by a fallen tree. Owned: one year. Never a problem. Great handling, pickup, & very reliable. Guess it helps to keep up with maintenance. Radio & 6-disc CD player was adequate for me. Nav, easy to operate once I learned it. Decided to trade because of lousy fuel mileage (17-18 mpg), wanted lower pymts, & a smaller car. Bought 2005 BMW 330i sedan - very satisfied so far. If Infiniti would spend more time improving gas mileage and less time designing needless gadgets this car would fly out of dealerships. ","Handling, design, performance, reliability, interior layout. Navigation, backup camera, smooth shifting 7-speed automatic transmission.",Improve fuel mileage. Don't need three different ways to operate the radio. Fold-down rear seats is a very nice feature to have.
4.5,2009 Infiniti M35X,lanthorne ,03/19/2010,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,3,4,"I bought a used M35X from the dealer last month. It had 18,000 miles on it and was a rental car in its previous life.  I have had the car for about 1 month now. The car drives really well. The acceleration is very good. The interior is spacious and well designed. This car has the Premium Technology package and is full of cool features.  It is the top pick in the Consumer Reports evaluation for mid-size luxury cars. Reliability is next only to the Lexus LS 430 according to Consumer Reports. The only issue is with the Rear Crash ratings from IIHS which is ""Poor"" compared to an Acura RL which is rated Good on all the tests.  The Road Noise can be lower although the engine hum is enjoyable.","Technology features like the Hard Disk for storing Music, Steering wheel and seat position that adjust automatically.","Less road noise, smoother steering wheel and more sensitive system to turn off the turn signal once you are done with a slight turn."
2.875,WORST Technology On The Market,LGMWireless ,09/28/2009,,,3,3,3,3,,4,5,1,1,"I have been a Lexus customer for 12 years. We shopped around and found the M35X. They pushed their technology so much at the dealership we felt it had to be as good as Lexus if not better. Boy were we wrong. Unfortunately I now have 38 months of this nightmare left. I returned an 06 Lexus GS, which my phone the Palm Pre had no trouble pairing with the Bluetooth. My 09 M35X does not work at all with these phones. Static all the time and that supposedly great Bose radio that lowers and loudens itself at will comes on and off during a conversation. Then there is the nav - what a waste of money. No points of interest. Been lost a lot lately. $53000 really Infiniti. Entire system was replaced by dealer, no luck.",The car itself is beautiful and has a really nice ride.,Fix it update your technology and you will have a great car.
4.875,Outstanding Car,Frank M ,08/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just traded a 2006 M45, which I loved, for this car. I got the M35 to save a few bucks and get better gas mileage.  The M35 with the 7 speed is almost as quick as the M45.  The car rides great and is fun to drive, I got the Tech and Advanced Tech with Sport Packages.  Love the DVD player, new 7 speed transmission with sport mode, hard disk music box, IPOD hook up, navigation and touch screen.  All but the DVD and navigation are new features my 2006 did not have. I got the Blue Slate with black interior and it looks great!","The car is great - instant throttle response, amazing handling, quiet ride, all the technology and 14 speaker sound.  The music box is great, just drop in a CD and it records and stores it on the hard disk, up to 2900 songs! Also, it is the largest and easiest to get in and out of in it's class! ","Gas mileage could be better, but the car is geared to give V-8 performance and it does.  The IPOD dock does not charge the IPOD, this should be corrected as the IPOD battery will drain and die without notice, this happened twice to me.  However, once I get the music box loaded I won't need the IPOD!"
4.875,Worth the Price,MJ ,08/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is my second M35S as I also had a 2006. The ride in the 2009 is a little stiffer, but still comfortable for a car with 19"" performance tires. The increase in power along with the 7 speed transmission makes for a great combination. The gas mileage is about the same as the 2006 at about 20mpg in mixed driving. Looked at Jaguar FX, Lexus GS, Acura TL and Audi A5. None could come close to the lease deal. Best value in its class. ","Handling, power, features and looks. Trouble free.",Even though the 5.1 stereo in nice Infiniti needs to get rid of Bose. It cannot compare to Lexus or Acura. With the 7 speed transmission expected better gas mileage on the hwy. 
3.625,"Rattles, rattles, rattles",Lee ,08/14/2009,,,3,5,2,5,,4,4,2,4,How much do you have to pay these days for a car that does not rattle?  In the first few thousand miles I have return this car for 3 rattles. Rattles in the dash and doors are making this car a major regret.  ,"Room, controls, LED lighting, solid V6","Replace the cheap plastic clips in the dash and door to prevent the rattles. Consumer service is below average when dealing with such issue. XM radio sound quality is below standard compare to the sound coming from the CD, jukebox and FM radio. Unit losses signal and goes off air too often. "
4.875,This is a great car for the money!  ,Mike M ,08/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I really love the 2009 M35-S. My previous car was a 2007 M35 Sport as well. The car handles extremely well, can excel quickly from a dead stop, and is very sporty inside and out. Even when taking the car in for service at the dealership, they tend to give M owners a little extra attention and they go out of their way to make you feel special. All in all, I'd recommend the M35 S to anyone.   ","SAT Radio, the new 303bhp engine and the power that comes with it, the smooth ride, and styling. ","The Navigation system needs improvement. Even in the 2009 model, there are many places not stored in the hard drive. My Garmin GPS in my other car is better. Luckily, I don't go many places in Atlanta where I need NAV. Gas mileage can also be improved upon. "
5,I'm definitely impressed!!!!,m4mike ,07/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am very happy with this car. Solid ride, quiet, nice interior. Visually distinct lines on the car. Very responsive steering. Transmission shifts are smooth and close together. Coming off a 2004 Audi A6, the build and ride quality of the M seems much better. Averaging 19 mpg in mixed driving.","Power, acceleration, handling, rear wheel drive, bluetooth, voice command, exhaust note, smart key high quality feel and look, heated and cooled seats.",None I can think of right now...
4.875,WOW,mikez ,07/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I  was looking to buy the new Lexus GS and then test drove the Infiniti m35S and was sold on it! I bought the car the next day! I love my first Infiniti. It has enough power to get me in trouble and is sexy on the inside and out! The interior is beautiful and I love the heated/cooled seats! Most car for the money on the road. Also, the Infiniti dealership was the best car-buying experience I've ever had. ","Heated/Cooled seats, Back up camera, handling, beautiful leather & wood trim interior, BOSE sound",Have yet to find one thing...
3,Too many rattles!,Lee ,06/02/2009,,,1,4,2,4,,4,4,2,3,6 visit to the shop without success fixing 4 rattles and 4 trips to the shop regarding NAV failure. Must use my I-phone for dependable navigation. Will NOT buy another Infiniti product.,I hate this car with all the cheap plastic parts that RATTLE.,"Better communication, fix the issue rather than blame the customer. Can you hear me now?"
5,Exceeding My Expectations,diane springate ,04/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The M35 is a dream machine. I got it with the Tech and Advanced Tech packages and the vehicle has exceeded my expectations. Driving is no longer about going from point A to B. Driving is the destination. The M35 is so much fun to drive and there is so much you can do while you are driving that it is a vehicle designed for efficiency. Lane Guidance works great, the review camera with a grid makes backing up a pleasure. Recently I slammed on the brakes at the last minute and the brake assist and seat belt tensioner kicked right in making me feel safe and secure. The power of the vehicle also makes it safe - it is possible to leap out of the way of a potential collision. Great, great car.","The 5.1 surround sound is too much fun although you have to buy designated music DVDs. The regular sound is excellent, too. The back up camera is a huge plus.","Voice recognition is not perfect but when it does not understand what I am saying I just start over. I have no suggestions for improvements, it is a fantastic vehicle. I've read other reviews where writers mention the fuel economy but what do I expect? This is a performance vehicle and it delivers. "
4.5,Great car,Richard ,02/17/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"Took delivery of my new M35x 3 weeks ago. Just came out of a Lexus GS300 AWD. Although the Lexus was a little more ""cushy"" and had one or two more conveniences, this car is really the only other luxury vehicle that comes close in features, quality and value retention. The ""M"" definitely rides much better/feels glued to the road. Also has better electronics such as the navigation system which is easier to use and the sound system with the hard drive which records your CDs (very cool). I got the tech pkg, so I got the upgraded Bose system, but not the 5.1 system that comes with advanced tech pkg. Even though it is not their best, it still is far superior to the Lexus' Mark Levinson system.","Sound system with hard drive, nav system, heated/cooled seats standard and solid but comfortable ride. Corners like a Mini.","Gas mileage is really a major disappointment. The ""x"" needs the extra gear the non-""x"" has. Can't seem to break 20 mpg ave. Not good for a car that is otherwise so outstanding."
5,Infiniti M35,Brandon ,12/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car, we found, is one of the best investments for your money.  Tons of options, spectacular entrance levels (the basic car is still outstandingly  nice), and the appearance of the M35 all contribute to the brilliant design of this sedan. ","Dashboard, tail light design, navigation system control, African rosewood interior, ""cornering lights"" that automatically move the direction you turn, Infiniti embroidered logo on seats, and the air conditioned/ heated leather seats.  Also the push button start is very ""James Bondish"" in my opinion.","Front grille/ hood could be more ""flashy""."
