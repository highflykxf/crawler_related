5,WONDERFUL MIDSIZE SUV,Wes ,11/14/2016,5,4,3,,,5,4,5,5,,,"'09 Edge LTD, FWD, 20"" wheels, 85k miles.  Extremely good seat comfort and legroom (front & back) and smooth ride comfort -- both better than wife's Cadillac SRX.  Great acceleration, braking and handling.  Attractive exterior and interior styling.  Gas mileage OK for SUV V6 -- 18 city, 24 highway @ 70-80mph.  Problems:  1. Air conditioning completely failed, very expensive to repair; however it's the only repair item.  2. Dash lighting very poor at dusk and dawn, cannot be improved.  3. Steering wheel control buttons poorly engineered.  4. Rear camera and dash screen not available, must rely on bumper buzz alerts.  Overall, very happy with vehicle and will replace with a new Edge before 100k miles.",,

5,I love my Edge!,Pam ,12/23/2015,4,4,4,,,5,4,5,4,,,"We bought our Edge used with 38,000 miles on it in 2012. It now has 116,600 miles on it, has been cross-country 7 times, up and down mountains, through blinding rain storms, and it has never failed me yet. The only repair we've had to do so far was to replace the windshield washer jets ($20 DIY) and replace the cabin air filter. (When you think the AC isn't working, check the filter.) It's even pulled a fully-loaded 6 x 12 trailer more than 5000 miles with no problem. I won't be replacing it until it just won't run anymore.",,

Have had it recharged and tested.Have cleaned filter screen behind glove box.Weak as water!IthinkFORDshould be ashamed of themselves they know this AC system sucks and should be responsible and RECALL all EDGES 2007-2010.

Nothing would  When I took the car in to be repaired, the air would come back on and work properly.  Later, the coolness of the air would vary from time to time.  I never know when it will work, and when it won't.  I work, and I don't have time to run back and forth to the service dept.

3.5,Lemon Amongst Apples,Gayle ,07/31/2010,,,4,4,1,3,,4,4,4,4,"Bought the Edge after owning a Tahoe, what a difference in gas mileage. I like the SUV but I got a lemon. I have talked to multiple Edge owners and none have had my problems.This truck has major problems with the brakes I have brought it in multiple times to have them looked at for excessive pulsing in the brakes and it is still pulsing worst than ever. There is also a major smell in the cabin of oil burning. I brought the SUV in for that also but was told it was a bag in the manifold, that was 2 years ago and the smell still comes and goes. Well I guess its a good thing I leased the SUV. I know many Edges owners and they love it.

3.25,Not a 10 anymore!,On the Edge ,02/01/2010,,,4,4,4,2,,3,3,3,3,"I bought the Edge because I wanted the styling, the dual roof and a Ford. But within the first year, the dual roof broke twice, the car stalled twice until it was determined it needed a new part. It is sluggish up a hill and slipped from being a 10 to a 5 in my recent opinion. All my friends know the problems I have had and have purchased other SUVs. No one I know will buy an Edge. I think I have a lemon and don't find my review reflective of all Edge's. But my lemon is getting more sour in it's second year. The roof is stuck again.

4.875,new ford owner,giants fan ,01/11/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,We bought our edge when our grand prix was going downhill and we needed a bigger car due because of having a child. We've never owned a ford because I've always been weary on buying them but I was very impressed with it. Test drive was awesome. Car rides really nice and smooth.

However, Ford needs to add an indicator on the dash to show when the lights are ""on"". They could have added softer material to the door panels (near windows) so the interior doesn't feel so ""plastic""- at least in the Limited model. The on screen buttons need to be larger. Otherwise great car and fun to drive- has great leg room in rear and I can pack a lot of things with the seats folded down flat. Very versatile. I was very surprised how much I enjoy owning and driving my Edge and am not disappointed one bit.","Smooth ride Good looks Uncomplicated buttons, easy to reach Seats are comfortable Versatile storage","An indicator on the dashboard when the lights are in the ""ON"" position Larger on-screen buttons for the NAV system Softer, cushioned material on the inside doors so they are no so ""plastic"""
5,Best purchase I've ever made,Andrew ,11/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This Edge is a great vehicle.  The SYNC system is a great safety feature.  I was involved in an accident when a person turned left right in front of me and I was on the phone with 911 in less than 5 seconds.   Highway MPG has been excellent for a vehicle of it's size at 24-25 mpg at 70-75 mph.   In town I average 18-19 mpg.  The quality of the interior is outstanding.  The leather is plush, the heated seats excellent, and the air conditioning is strong.  Plenty of power, smooth shifting, comfortable seating and great view.  Only negative is it's hard to judge how wide it is when entering our garage, I've had a few near misses with the mirrors.

2.75,So very disappointed,martha ,10/31/2009,,,3,4,2,1,,1,4,3,4,"I bought my 2009 Edge in May of 09 and by this month (Oct 09) the car is having transmission issues.  It also had to have the front passenger speaker replaced...twice!  Needless to say that i am horribly disappointed with Ford and regret getting rid of my reliable GMC Yukon.   I thought I was going to save on the mileage, but I would have preferred to keep spending a ton on gas than have to deal with all the issues this 5 month old car has given me.  I will never again purchase Ford or any other make/model this company makes and will do everything I can to tell people to avoid Ford vehicles like the plague!

I have been very impressed with the vehicle itself but disappointed in some of the ""amenities"". The IP is very difficult to see in low light conditions-this in itself will prevent a repurchase as both drivers feel it is dangerous. The radio (LED)  is archaic ,difficult to read .

The ride is quiet, smooth and handles well, practically glides over bumps, potholes & train tracks. Front seats are very comfortable. Lumbar support adds comfort on long trips. Synch makes it a car for the 21st century. Mileage could be better but, hey, at least it doesn't takes premium unleaded gas. The interior is spacious for passengers & cargo. Rear and front passenger seats fold down providing lots of room for trips to the hardware store. Comes with key fob so no more locking my keys in the car.","Synch providing Satellite radio, navigation, Bluetooth, & current gas prices in the area you're in. Great sound system.

People have commented that it looks like a Lexus and I think it rides like one too. I really like SYNC and all of it's associated features. It is roomy on the inside and is easy to maneuver. The turning radius is great. I also like the automatic liftgate. I have not had it on the highway yet but am averaging 18 MPG in the city. I expect to get around 25 on the highway. It has a lot of zip to it. I think Ford finally has a crossover SUV that can compete with Honda and Toyota brands. ,I like the SYNC and the power liftgate. I also added a remote start to it which will be nice in the hot Texas summers. The cargo area has plenty of space for hauling especially when you put down the rear seats and fold the passenger seat foreword.,Improve the gas mileage and get rid of the ambient lighting.

I read the book cover to cover and went out to set all my electronics and preferences. Filled it up, got on the parkway, pressed the reset button for the MPG function and took a 2 hour drive.

So far I am very satisfied with the entire car as a whole. The drive is smooth and quiet with good acceleration when needed. The body styling is attractive in a timeless way. It looks masculine and beefy, unlike the CRV or the Vue, and it doesn't have any over-exaggerated curves that might make it dated in a few years, like the Murano. The interior is roomy, comfortable, and stylish (despite what some professional reviews say). The best part is the Sync system and touch- screen display--it makes the car fun to drive.
