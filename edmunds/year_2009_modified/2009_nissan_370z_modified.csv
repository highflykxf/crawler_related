4.625,Fun to drive!,ohiodoug ,07/28/2014,,,4,5,5,4,,5,4,5,5,"I bought this car in the summer of 2009 kind of on a whim.I had been wanting a sports car and it was between this and a Dodge Challenger.Well, with Chrysler bankrupt and Challenger production on hold, I looked into the Z. (As it turns out the Challenger wouldn't have fit in the garage anyway).I have this with the 7 speed auto and paddle shifters, which is almost as fun as a manual.This car is straight out fast and the tires stick like glue!If you don't push it, it actually gets pretty darn good mileage, but it's hard to refrain from excess speed.Love the control layout and info screen. I've had one problem area (see below).","Straight line performance and handling.
Absolutely a blast to drive and it feels really different than a 3.5 liter Altima Coupe I also test drove.
The seats are actually pretty comfortable, but being my first sports car I feel like I'm sitting soooo low!
Decent stereo, nice control layout.","In terms of the design, this car just screams for a backup camera -visibility is awful.
You just learn to live with it and if you have to back up, do so with care.
Mechanically, I had one time (about 3 years in) wher the car acted out of fuel with almost 1/4 tank.
I saw another Z owner say this, and it was a known problem with Nissan Quests.
I never had a problem before even when getting the car within a gallon of empty, but since this time I make sure to fill up at 1/4 tank. I was also disappointed at the lack of an oil cooler since I was thinking about trying to autocross the car.
That (along with overheating of brake fluid under extreme conditions) mean it can't be a track car."

5,Nissan Certified 370Z Touring 6MT,djrelic247 ,07/03/2012,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Everything about the vehicles is a positive.It's a REAL sports car so there isnt going to be much of any cargo room. I mean the owner's manual doesnt even fit in the glove box.Only Im luke warm about is the initial clutch engagement aka the friction point. It is very high on the clutch pedal and the window from friction point to full engagement is the smallest Ive ever felt. This is the stock clutch. The clutch is very linear as well, so you really need to feel when it bites at first.But there is a cheap fix for it, which is buying a clutch helper spring to replace the OEM one.Better fix is a new clutch assembly which makes it feel like any other car you have driven.",,

5,My 2nd Z,dmpete ,03/08/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Picked up a used 09' a couple of days ago, this is great. Coming out of a BMW that had nothing but problems, always liked the Z, kinda my halo car (the 300ZX twin turbo). I have drove one, this new 370 outshines it in almost every way. There is road noise, but the feel of the car is great, acceleration is good, w/ in a few ticks better or worse than my M. Steering is very tight, the suspension is a little softer than my old M, but not in a bad way. The Bose system sounds great. First weekend put over 200 miles on her. Great driving car, and have already started getting looks. Overall this is a home run for Nissan. And I love it.","The styling, the flared fenders. The tight shift gates. The power of course. The wrap around interior. The Bose surround. Heated Leather/suede combo, basically everything.","Can't really think of anything, Nissan did their homework on the Porsche Cayman, who they matched in almost every way for way less money"

Purchased a base 6 speed w/ the sport package. I have driven it in the mountains of NC and was able to attack curves w/ the same speed as I was able to on the bike. I look forward to every drive. Yes, the 050 Bridgestones can be loud on bad pavement, but that is what Dynamat is for. Easy fix. Don't let tire noise keep you from enjoying this little gem. The best value in sports cars period.","Handling, power (flat torque curve w/ potent top end), styling (exterior and interior) and value","NVH-the engine can be a little raucous near red-line, would prefer a factory installed and warranted oil cooler- temps can range from 195 to 240 degrees on average, 230 degrees @ 80mph in 100 degree heat (interstate) and 240 degrees in the mountains going uphill, tougher paint (chips easily)"

2.625,Dont waste your money,NICK ,08/07/2010,,,2,5,1,1,,2,2,4,4,"When I bought my 370 I really thought I was buying quality, boy was that wrong. I paid cash and still spent all day waiting why I don't know and I said I wanted a spoiler added my sales guy said no you don't well I was sure I did. The sales part took way to long and the dealers knew nothing about the car. The car itself was fun to drive for about 3 days I could hear every Stone smack and everything else possible, I had water in both tail lights all the little flaps behind the wheels fell off. The paint was horrible it chipped every time I drove the car, when the tags were put on the lot guy ran screws into the bumper why use the bracket? Nissan service was horrible save your money&buy something else.",the look and it was fast,"Nissan should start by improving their service standards. Nissan should also have the kinds of fluids that your car needs i needed antifreeze and they didn't have it ever,the overall quality of the car was terrible,uncomfortable, needs sound proofing, make the car worth the money don't rush it   "

I can't stop grinning every time I sit on my 370z  I had been in the market for a sports car and I was considering the Gen Coupe, oh Boy I'm glad I went for the Z. I got a great deal ($1000 below invoice) and the APR I want. Syncro Rev match really helps you if you are a novice driver. Best bang for your buck in terms of performance and handling for a sports car.","The Exterior Styling is unlike anything you see on the road, it just plain gorgeous.

4.75,Best Z-Car Yet.,Greg ,05/30/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"My first car was 72 240z and I had an 83 280ZX. The 370 is the best yet. It is quick and nimble. You rarely have to plan your moves in traffic just look for an open spot and the Z will be there. People complain that the gearshift is ""notchy"" I am not sure what that means? I find it quick and accurate. People complain about road noise. It is a two seater sports coupe. You expect a little road noise. You might try learning to judge the character of the road surface from the sound. Most of all, this car is just fun to drive. I commute 90 min each way daily. In the Z I actually look forward to the drive. The seats are so comfortable. They actually get more comfortable the longer you sit in them.","It is fun to drive. People notice it where ever I go. If I see two a week, that's a lot and I live in L.A. Handling breaking and performance. Good sound system and just the right amount of road noise. Nice interior a definite step up for Z-Car interiors.",I wish the ventilation system worked better. The A/C always comes on and you have to switch it off. (I just want fresh air). Recirc won't run without the A/C period. Switch off the A/C and Recirc cuts off. After about an hour the fresh air starts getting warmer and warmer. I just want fresh cool air

4.625,All true,pwinn ,05/12/2010,,,5,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"I had the the 350Z roadster. Loved the top down. For 5 years. The 370Z is all new inspired by the 350.  Goes and looks right in every way. I have the touring and sport pkg, 6 spd. Corners and pulls off the line as promised. Rear wheel wells are noisy in the rain-road noise. The value of the car verses what you pay overrides noisy tires.

4.875,"It's all true, the good and the bad",JR ,04/24/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"First the bad news. The tire noise in this car (touring with sport package)is unacceptable. I drive 60 miles to work each day and the noise is terrible. Nissan really dropped the ball with nvh.  The good news is, the fix for tis pretty cheap and easy. Buy some sound deadener for about $150, then spend an afternoon installing it and all of a sudden you have a fun to drive, world class sports car that will run with anything on the road and get attention everywhere you take it.  Acceleration and handling are great. Bose system is pretty good and interior quality is significantly better than the 350Z. ","Looks, power, acceleration, suede like interior, an actual glove box, behind seat storage shelves. Car feels nimble and ready to go unlike my previous car (G37 coupe that was too weighed down to be fun to drive)","Fix the tire noise, fix the tire noise, fix the tire noise. Put the aux input in the arm rest so you don't have to see the wires. Add streaming bluetooth audio, maybe add an induction tube like on the mustang to create a better engine sound in the cabin"

4.75,poor man's GT-R,True Sports Car ,04/17/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"We got the Sports package with the upgraded wheels, brakes, suspension, etc.  The ride is firm but not overly stiff, even with the 19's.  Yellow paint has every head turning.  The front plastic spoiler gets scraped on every 4"" driveway.  The blind spots are significant but that's why they give you 3 mirrors.  I've had a C5 'Vette with the Z51 suspension, the Z rides no worse, and it probably won't leak in the rain.  The MPG is mid 20's but the car is still new, hopefully better with time.  I love the look, handling, ride and Nissan parts availability and reliability.  The difference between a GT-R and a 370Z is not so much performance but cost of parts when tires, brakes, etc. are replaced","Yellow Z with 19"" wheels and tinted windows.  It could be used in a video.... handles like it's on rails, light weight, big tires, firm suspension.  After celebrating birthdays on the dealer's showroom for 6 months it was ours for invoice to make room for  the 2010's.  Timing is everything in life.","a better front lip spoiler that won't hang-up on every 4"" surface road flaw and driveway entrance.  Mileage could be better but I didn't buy it for mpg.

Everything they say about the car is true - road noise loud, very stiff, kidney shaker, stripped down, etc..... and it is exactly as advertised. If you want a track car that looks great and fun to drive then this car is for you. If you want seat warmers, GPS, BOSE system, all the creature comforts - stick with the regular 370Z with the sports package.  Just my 2 cents worth.",The way this car turns into a corner at 90 mph.

4.375,Fun to drive,Dee ,03/10/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,3,3,5,"Fun to drive, awesome acceleration, eye candy.  Getting in and out takes getting used to. Be aware of blind spots and limited rear view visibility. Bucket seats somewhat uncomfortable, the raised sides excessively squeeze my legs, I am only 170lb so I can only imagine how uncomfortable that might feel for someone of a bigger posture.  AC seems to be slow to kick in... Navigation hard to read on sunny days.","Navigation, acceleration, looks, Bose system is simply awesome, like the CF flash reader in audio system.","Sunglasses holder, parking sensors and rear view camera, ipod integration works with iPhone but does not charge it.

4.875,ZZoooming the best deal,Big Sky Blue ,02/08/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"A true sports car. I've owned a couple Corvettes and Z28's but none tracked as straight and true as this car. Steering is tight but confident and nothing matches the brakes of the Z car! Ride quality is stiff for the Sport model, but one certainly does not wallow in the seat through turns. Interior layout and quality are excellent. Love the no-key ignition and locking system. In late summer temps of 80's to low 90's and running air conditioning, oil temp gauge never went above 240! By eliminating Styrofoam filler behind seats where Touring models add speakers...1 1/2 cu. feet of more cargo space was found. Amazing how much stuff can be loaded in this small car! Agree with Oldguy-soft paint!","Design...design...design in and out. Performance and control. A true driver's car. Gauges are excellent...I even like the ""odd-ball"" computer gauge. Interior auto-temp system works excellently. Love that Sync-rev system and appreciate the output for gear selection.",Harder paint surface with stronger clear-coat finish. Little softer seat inserts. A back up camera would be nice. Road noise is not a big problem but more isolation would be helpful. Can not hear the engine or exhaust below about 3000 rpm. Please - this is a SPORTS car!

4.875,Nostalgia Strikes,GAR ,01/20/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,I owned 72 240Z and my wife had a 280ZX. I have several similar cars over the years. When I first drove 370Z I was reminded powerfully of my 240.  This is a drivers car. You don't step into it but instead you wear it. You feel the road in your hands and the seat of your pants. You hear the roar of the road and judge it's condition from the sound. The sport package makes the handling even more precise. The car seems to go where you want it too by thought control. This car demands your full attention but you are rewarded with an exciting driving experience that makes any trip even the daily commute fun. If you want a 2-seater sports car the Nissan 370Z deserves your serious consideration.,"The ride is taught without being harsh. The manual transmission shifts with confidence and a definite directness. The handling, especially with the sport package, tight, precise, and fun. ","More storage nooks would be helpful. Both my 240Z and the 280ZX had cargo straps, which are sorely missed in the 370Z. I don't how or if you could improve it, but the storage locker that get if you do not have the navigation system installed, is useless."

Platinum graphite paint job - WOW!  This car turns heads!  The interior is plenty roomy for me, great sound from the Bose stereo, fairly smooth ride for such a small car.  This is a great sports car, at a great price.  I thought I loved my last car, a 2000 Toyota Celica GT-S.  The Nissan 370Z is a million times better!  I won't complain about the gas mpg, it's a fair trade off if you want a higher performance car.  This car isn't for you if you want a family car, or SUV.

Surprisingly good fuel economy---28 highway mpg, before break-in, when I drove her home on the Interstate. I've owned them all---from Cadillac to Miata---and I can say that this car is outstanding in all respects. Solid as a rock. Impressive interior quality. Breathtakingly beautiful exterior styling. Refined power and comfortable ride without compromising handling. Nissan stands for (and again delivers) excellent value and promises long-term trouble-free performance with minimal and afforable maintenance requirements. This car will age gracefully and depreciate well.    ","The styling and exterior looks are breathtaking. I stare at her endlessly. Excellent value for the price. The 370 Z is a Nissan and that provides the implied promise of confident and trouble free ownership and affordable maintenance. Love that keyless entry and ignition. Wonderful engine ""growl.""","Back up camera option. Also, take the Aux port (for iPod) off the front of the head unit, as the cable and iPod are always visible and hanging out without of place of their own. Also,I'm hearing the paint is a bit soft.

My initial concerns about this car were the ""snugness"" of the interior, and the extensive road noise.  The test drive alleviated both concerns.  The ride was comfortable, even for a former 5'10"" 237lb football player.  The road noise was acceptable.  I for one like to hear the engine while I drive.  It makes me feel more in-tune with the car.  This car is absolutely gorgeous and it's performance is off the charts.

However, two SMALL problems perk up. I'm a typical American (read FAT), and the 370Z's seats are a tad narrow for my thunder thighs (small quip, not a deal breaker).

I have been very disappointed with my 2009 370Z Car, because you can't drive it over 4000 RPM's, if the ambient temperature is over 90 degrees. As a result, I only have 630 miles on my 370Z!  The 370Z Car, without an engine oil cooler, will over-heat! The engine oil temperature reaches 280 degrees, if the ambient temperature is over 90 degrees, and it will do it in a very short period of time.  When this happens, the car's engine RPM's are reduced from 7500 RPM's to 6500 RPM's, and if the engine oil temperature reaches 290 degrees, the engine's RPM's will be reduced to 4500 RPM's, which is approximately half of the 370Z Horsepower!","The 2009 Nissan 370Z is an excellent handling car.

I ledfoot it all the time and have never seen my oil temp gauge above 225(& I live in Central Georgia). Build quality and finish are outstanding. Heat isn't an issue unless you take it to the track.

I have the touring pkg. with alcantra seat inserts that are comfortable in hot or cold weather. This thing goes great, brakes well, handles well, and is flat out just FUN!  I considered a Porsche Boxster or Cayman, but this is more involving at 2/3rds the price.

The only problems so far are that the seats are made for smaller/thinner people. If you are larger, they may not be comfortable. The access for a ""lighter"" style battery connection is up under the passenger side console. Not very convenient for plugging in cell phones, etc. The back cargo area is very limited. Our small dog's crate will not fit in there so we can't use the car for traveling.  The blind spot in the rear quarter panels on both sides is bad and I have almost changed lanes on top of people twice. Limited rear view.

I've had numerous contacts with Nissan's Consumer Affairs Department, regarding the 370Z Car's need of an ENGINE OIL COOLER.  The 370Z can not handle driving at speeds of 60 MPH, or more, with out the ENGINE OIL TEMPERATURE reaching the 280 degree mark, which is what Nissan indicates is the MAX OIL TEMPERATURE the car should operate at.

People pull up next to me while driving and ask questions about it. I have no problem with the seats(mine's leather) and the bose system is awesome.The music does not distort at all even at the highest setting. I've reached speeds up to 120+ mph easy. The manual transmission is really tight and close. It can jump off the line with no problem. The trunk can fit at least 2 mid sized suit cases.  The two problems I found though is that there is a blind spot behind you and when the sun is shining directly on the fuel gauge you can't see it at all.

Having said that, there are some items that Nissan must serious consider adding to the 370Z.  The car's engine must have an engine oil cooler, because it can't handle any extremely hot weather without loosing a large amount of engine power, dut to the oil temperature getting to HOT! ","The new Nissan 370Z has excellent power and handling features, and if FUN to drive.","The 370Z need the same tpye of tire pressure monitoring system that was on the 350Z, which monitors each individual tires poressure.

Having said that, there are several features missing on the 370Z that would really make the car truly outstanding.  They are as follows: This car desperately needs an oil cooler for it to perform at the speeds it's capable of; needs the same low tire pressure monitoring system that was on the 350Z; needs to have a digital speed indicator, like the 350Z has; and the information panel need a complete update.","The 370Z handles as good as any sports car out made.  It has good power, but with just a little bit to tweaking, could develop much more horse power. I think the Nissan engineers did a good job with up grading of the interior.","Add Engine Oil cooler, which is a must. Could be why Nissan is suggesting using Ester Oil in the car's engine!

PLEASE have an option to display the SPEEDOMETER DIGITALLY.  I can't tell you how much easier it is to have a digital display.  If not replace the traditonal needle with the digital display, at least give us an option to show it with a multifunction display inside the speedometer, like Honda and Mercedes-Benz has done!
