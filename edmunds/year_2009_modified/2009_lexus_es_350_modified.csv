5,First Lexus ....Last Lexus ?,Rich ,07/20/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I've now had this car about 2 years and I am very pleased . I had some initial strange symptoms that never came back . Since then , no problems . This car is very quiet, very powerful ( more then I need) very economical (over 32 on the road, 28 around town) . I still think the sound system is not up to the quality of my former Avalon ( JBL System). I just took this car on a 1600 mile trip where my wife commented that unlike other cars, your not tired after long rides in this car. I am looking at possibly purchasing another Lexus, possibly a new one. I am also very impressed with Lexus service. Service reps make every effort to give you the very best possible service. Many dealers offer perks to include free wash and or oil changes. The service area is more like a restaurant/lounge then a service area. Very pleasant place to spend time waiting  for your car. These are fine cars , living up to the reliability that I've come to know in the 8 Toyotas I've owned in the past  adding  the edition of luxury !",,

My only minor critique on the car is that although the front seats are decently comfortable,there is room for improvement in that area.","It is a pleasure to drive,and it looks sharp!

4,Great car sans the rattles,jeff205 ,02/28/2011,,,5,3,4,5,,5,4,3,3,This is my second ES. The prior was an ES 330. The car is quiet in terms of road noise. Performance is great unless you are used to driving a high performance BMW. I';s easy to look down and see you are cruising at 80 thinking you are driving at 60. Interior materials are all high quality. I only have 2 complaints. First the sound system is sub-par for this class of vehicle. Second there is as persistant rattle in the sun-roof area that the dealer cannot seem to fix. There are also other bump related rattles that seem to develop during the first 20k miles.,Cooled seats. Nice combination of handling and ride. Great gas mileage. Quality interior materials. Comfortable car to drive.,A better sound system. Get rid of the rattles.

My 2 boys and I were traveling in Washington DC one evening and were T-Boned by a guy going about 50 mph who ran a stop light.  My ES 350 saved all 3 of us, it was amazing how the car took over, spun around and landed perfectly between the lines of the road and disengaged itself. The car was totaled but we all walked away.

4,Lexus ES 350 Is A Strange Car,Sam ,12/08/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,In many ways this car is very nice. It is solid and fast contrary to most user opinions. Even though the car is quiet....it is hard to explain you can hear rattles and noises that are annoying. BMW and Mercedes are better built cars but the ES 350 feels better when you are in the car purely for comfort. The ES 350 needs to get rid of the rattles.,More room space and ergonomically a better car than Mercedes and BMW.,Get rid of the rattles. The outside design of the car can be boring. The driver's seat needs more cushion for the back.

5,Great VALUE,LexMan ,10/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Smooth serene (very minimal wind noise at 70 MPH) luxurious ride on freeways.  My previous '93 LS 400 (AIR SUSPENSION) however, was still noticeably smoother on bumpy roads.  The Mark Levinson's CLARITY is auditory nirvana.  Bluetooth, navigation, parking assists, and backup camera are highly useful features.  Glovebox is small; SECRET: there is an elastic strap in its upper right FRONT corner to secure the HUGE owner's manual to the small ledge at the back of the glovebox.  Center storage console's capacity is better in the 2010 design.  Only serious competitor for IMMEDIATE VALUE is the Hyundai Genesis, but can be jittery over bumpy roads with unknown reliability and likely faster DEPRECIATION.","Mark Levinson, Bluetooth, Navigation, Rain sensing wipers, Park assist, Backup camera","After less than 3000 miles driving conservatively (ie, COMBINED mileage of 27 MPG), there are a few small rock chips on my front bumper/hood.  The paint is SOFTER than my previous LS. Allegedly, Toyota has a new more RESILIENT clearcoat on the new 2010 LS 460.  A clear bra may be the solution for now."

It was just not a reliable vehicle, in the shop for problems at least once a year.  After reading reviews about the ES350 we decided to give it a try.  So far I'm enjoying the car.  The ride is nice, not quite as quiet as the Mercedes, but very nice.  Gas mileage is great, 29mpg can't complain about that.  GPS is fun, and the bluetooth I like.

The acceleration is as smooth as can be and you are pampered in the most sumptuous surroundings when inside. However, one annoying quirk is the fact that the 2009 model is missing a pop- out hanger hook.

5,So far I LOVE everything about it,luv2drive ,09/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just bought a 2009 ES 350 - got a smoking good deal as the dealers are getting ready for the 2010's and want to move the 2009's out. $200 under invoice on a fully loaded model, premium plus, navigation, etc. I really like all of the features and have not experienced the GPS or Bluetooth probs another reviewer mentioned. Car handles like a dream, smooth, quiet, plenty of power. I drove and researched many other makes and models such as the Infiniti G37, Hyundai Genesis, etc. The ES 350 was the best of the bunch and the best bang for the buck, too.

5,Smoother than Silk,Jurasick ,09/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The ride on this baby is super smooth. I went for the front-wheel drive and the fuel economy is a superb 29 on my daily commute. It is whisper quiet but can also pour on the power when needed. The navigation system is good but the GPS could use an update to provide better directions. Speakers are top notch as is the air conditioning. ,"Wood interior, seat power adjustments, parking assist and headlights.",Improve the navigation system. Please reduce the price for a full-fledged iPod connection. After market quote for iPod connector is $650 - parts and labor - which is quite a lot.

5,Best luxury value,mekianov ,08/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The ES is the best luxury value sedan in my opinion.  It's all weather friendly and it offers plenty of power and it's loaded up with equipment all for $42000 for a full size sedan.  Something you need to pay $10000 more for a Mercedez, BMW or Infinity and you sacrifice the fuel economy because of a heavy all wheel drive.  The car is quiet and nimble, smooth and extremely stylish.","Wood interior, back up camera, passenger memory seating, and 10 airbags.",

I only drove about 800 miles, but there isn't anything I seriously dislike about the vehicle.  All of the necessary features are great and the ride is beautiful. I tend to be a leadfoot and this car has not let me down, although the handling is a little light.  I test drove 14 different cars, seriously researched 26, and have always bought American previously.  The price was great, $8,000-$10,000 below  domestic competitors in its class with similar features. Needless to say, this was a big consideration when purchasing. The dealership was A+.

Power, looks, features, you can't go wrong.  I love the navigation and audio. Acceleration is smooth and it rides quiet.  This car is roomy in the front and back.  I test drove the Acrua TL and the Volvo S60, but neither was as exciting as my ES350.  The fall back is that some of the amenities look and feel cheap especially the trunk handles.  You only get two keys.  Even though I have park assist, I still find it difficult looking over my shoulder backing up and I also find the seating uncomfortable after driving long periods of time.

However, since owning the car for a while the integrated GPS is disaster and the blue tooth phone system does not work well either. I think it has to do with the microphone placement. I also own a Ford explorer (which has its own issues) but the GPS and bluetooth phone features just plain work better. I don't think I will buy another Lexus. I expected to pay more and have an issue free car but that is not the case.",Air conditioned vented seats work great.
