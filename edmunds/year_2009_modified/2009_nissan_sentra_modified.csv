4,Great value for the money,Steven McMacken ,09/07/2016,4,4,4,,,5,4,3,4,,,"I have been very happy with the performance of my Nissan Sentra. There have been no major repair issues, other than replacing the battery and the condition of the car is excellent with only some minor cosmetic nicks.",,
3.25,Not as expected,leonardosd ,06/10/2013,,,4,4,2,2,,3,4,4,3,"Purchased the car new in march 2009, in Mexico. Not as easy buying a new car here. Inmediately had problems with the breaks, always made a lot of noise. Dealer couldn't fix it, arguing they were eco-friendly. Besides that, tyres got worn on outside edge in 1 year. Again, dealer said it was normal. Had transmission problems just after the third year, when the warranty passed. Luckily, I had the extendend warranty, and they covered everything. After that, the engine started making weird noises, and dealer said I needed a new one. Apparentely, a cilinder got deformed. (Seriously). When this happened, I was through with it. Previously had a 99' Altima, never complained with it. ",Interior layout. Size. ,"Engine, transmission and breaks redesigned. "
4.875,Excellent Sentra,Joe R ,08/26/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Had a lot of cars over the years but this has to be one of the best. For a small car, it rides great! ",I bought it loaded and its a a very good looking car in and out. Great transmission for a lower price car,the top of the back bumper needs to be coated so it can not scratch when loading and unloading the trunk.  This is not limited to this car but most cars should have this.
4.5,Honda/Toyota fan gets converted by SpecV,deadlytedly ,07/14/2010,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I have been a Honda and Toyota owner for all of my life, and enjoy a sporty little sedan. The base Sentra was not that.  After testing out what I could get at my price point (both foreign and domestic), I felt I had made a decent decision, but really had *no* clue until she broke in.  At 2000 miles, the engine opened up in a great way. The chirp as the intake gulps in fresh air welcomes a heavy pull of acceleration. The exhaust note deepened as well. Smooth pull across the curve meets an angry red line.   The suspension the sportiest I have driven in a sedan. Power is put down easily and evenly.  Wholly impressed, and am looking at the Altima Coupe for my next purchase.  Strong 'A' rating","Overall drive- Suspension, Engine power curve and redline, exhaust note (not my usual concern, but wow!) Interior fit and finish- cloth seats are *very* comfy, dials and gauges easy on eyes.  Exterior SE-R and SpecV additions save it from being ugly. Taillights are gorgeous, rims beautiful. Price","She is tight and fast, but ugly. If you like the two former items, then this is easy to get over. The A pillars are HUGE, almost to safety concern. Intake baffling horrible- cold air going on ASAP. Mileage (my fault) XM Radio useless this far north. All faults are minor in comparison to evil grin."
3,Could Have Done Better for the Money,VegasJ ,05/25/2010,,,3,3,3,4,,2,3,4,2,It is still new so it is still nice.  BUT I have to say I am disappointed.  Especially since I was so happy with my previous Nissan Altima.  The Sentra is a budget car in driving experience but no so much in dollars.  I could have found a less expensive way to be bored.  The quality is ok but nothing special.  Not so comfortable for rear seat passengers over the age of 10.,The trip computer in the center console makes it at least look like you got something for your money.,Bring the price down to match the value of the car.
2.875,Not happy,Stacey ,05/11/2010,,,3,4,2,2,,4,3,2,3,I am not at all happy with this car.  I have had it for 11 months and already the front brake pads had to be replaced and the rotors machined.  Today the a/c went out.  I'm only averaging 20 mpg.  The ironic thing is the FE stands for Fuel Economy.  I won't be buying another.,,
4.625,Continental Sport Contact 2 Tires Awful,KnightLog ,05/08/2010,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,5,5,Happy with the car. The sunroof whistles. The Lighter is in an odd location. The Original Equipment Tires that come with the car are Continental Sport Contact 2. They are terrible in the rain and when you hit highway patches you start to loose control. If you purchase a Sentra make sure you have the dealer pull these tires off first. :),200 HP Motor. Car has great Power.,No longer supply Continental Tires. Change lighter location. Power seats. A sunroof that does not whistle.
3.875,Impressive,Thomas ,01/01/2010,,,3,4,4,4,,5,4,3,4,We finally purchased a new car. Test drove Nissan Sentra sl and Toyota Corrola S. We then checked out the Nissan Sentra SER sedan. Performance and sporty look an feel sold us. Step out and pass you have the power to go. Recent trip gave all around 34MPG and driving conservatively 100k produced 42MPG highway. Lots of room sport pkg upgrades exterior and adds fog lights. moonroof and sporty bucket seats plus great stereo. Highly recommend this car.,Performance/ Room / Value,Fold down rear seat.  Keyless entry and optional Leather heated bucket seats                     
4,Cute Little Car No MPG,wallyw ,12/02/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,1,4,We have put 1500 miles in 4 months. For a small car it is nice to drive.  Do not like the gas mileage. It has averaged about 21 mpg in mixed driving since we bought it 4 months ago. Bought it during the clunker program. I always check the mileage when I fill up. I fill the car until the gasoline level stays in the top of the neck. I've never trusted the electronic mpg. Surprisingly enough it is pretty close.,"Enjoy the keyless entry, blue tooth, xm radio and CVT. Like the large glove box",Better mileage. Need to improve the windshield wiper location. It's to easy to turn on while turning the steering wheel
4.875,Great car / Great value,jeff ,10/07/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Cash for clunkers deal I was due a better vehicle. First new car I have ever bought. I looked at everything small to mid sized out there and I mean everything. I was looking for better mileage. Averaging 30 currently. Most cars were uncomfortable, over priced, cheap quality or no room. I am 6'2"" tall and my head hit the roof in half and my legs would have to be held up off of the seat to keep from smashing the gas pedal to the floor in the rest. Not in the Senta. Plenty of leg room, a whole hands with above my head. For you taller people, this one is it. It is very deceiving from the outside. Roomy, comfortable, solid car. Can't say enough good about it. ","Price. Leg and head room, handling, smooth running 4 cylinder. Lots of pep. Loads of great extra features you would expect in a higher priced vehicle.",Front view /grill design. From the back it looks sportier than the front.
5,Best little car I've ever owned,Mac88 ,09/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought this car with the idea to save money in the future to counter possible rising gas prices, and I was surprised at the design and overall quality. The CVT tranny is a little weird at first, but it's a great performer. Some may say it's boring, but if you just want to drive and not worry about shifting or rpm's then this is the one. Torque right off the bat is good, you can feel it in the seats, once car is at the speed you want, rpm goes down low, and it's quiet, surprisingly quiet on the freeway for a small car. Small on the outside, roomy on the inside. Big trunk, good styling, and fairly wide. It's comfortable enough for my commute, AC kicks butt, a real quality motor, quiet at idle.","Strong 2 liter motor, not too hard, comfortable seats, good quality mechanically, good styling, smooth cvt transmission, great MPG I'm getting 30+ combined.","Better radio, tires need to be a bit bigger/wider, can't pop trunk with standard key fob, a bit too much chrome in rear tail lights (I'm replacing with all red LED style anyway)"
4.75,Surprising Performance,Mike39 ,08/28/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've driven this car for only about 2000 miles. My initial impressions are that I am VERY satisfied. The interior is large for it's class (97.7cuft)and very much appreciated by my growing boys. The car I have has the CVT transmission. It runs very smooth and quiet under low torque applications- a little loud during acceleration. the ride is very quiet. The car has great amenities- good sound system, blue tooth, mp3 cd player w/ aux jack, keyless entry, car computer (mpg, dte, temp, etc). The blue tooth and keyless entry are a little extra, but this was the only car I found with a standard computer. Aluminum rims would of been a nice touch- worth the extra$ if you can find one with it.","Bluetooth, keyless entry are the ritz. Very pleased with the quiet ride and power of car.","Rear disc brakes, better quality of interior lighting. Standard alloy rims. Accuracy in mileage- sticker said 34 hyw- that's pushing it."
5,Love My Sentra,Denise ,08/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I test drove Nissan Sentra and just fell in love with it. It handled the curves well and had great pick up and go. I really liked how comfortable the seats were and how smooth the ride was. Having an auxiliary input jack for my MP3, Trip computer with outside temp, distance to empty, and steering wheel mounted audio controls was just extra icing on the cake.",Comfort. Acceleration and smoothness. Steering wheel controls. Fun to drive and stylish. And I love the color I picked (Brick Red),The odd shaped side mirrors. They are hard to get used too.
4.5,Another Nice Nissan,Kemp ,08/24/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Had A Jeep Grand Cherokee once that was under 36,000 miles and the transmission went out - the freeze Plugs went out and the final straw was when the windows would not go up - that was my turning point to buy a Toyota 4Runner or a Nissan Pathfinder - Thank You Jeep for forcing me to make the Move and Thank You Toyota for being more expensive. This is my 3rd Nissan and I must say my faith in Nissan is as strong as ever - With the added incentive for Cash For Clunkers how could I pass up on trading in a 1986 4x4 Ford Bronco II. To have such a Reliable vehicle again (Nissan) is like a breath of Fresh Air.",Smart Key - You'll Love it - get it / CVT makes for a very smooth quite ride on those not so bumpy roads,Better Shocks - on a vehicle with the Nissan name and quality we should not feel the bumps as we do. 
5,great car for the buck,fieldgeneral ,08/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Midyear model in midnight sky was the car I wanted after reviewing everything I could about the nissan vs.mazda3,honda civic and toyota corolla.  Had it two weeks now and very happy about choice. Great price too(rebates from dealer and nissan to dealer in addition to 4500 cars voucher) made it a no brainer. Interior comfort and roominess was best of the group.  I am 6'2"" and interior size was important. Great acceleration and smooth,seamless transmission, Handling is pretty good and quiet for a small car.  The only negative comments I  can make is the oddly shaped rearview mirrors and security alarm going off when unlocking trunk without unlocking doors first.  Otherwise s solid choice.",,
5,great car,jr ,07/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this car! I had a sunroof put in and it works and looks awesome. This is fun to drive. I love how it tells me how many miles I can go before empty. I test drove a toyota corolla before I drove this, it doesn't compare to the Nissan Sentra. Very smooth ride for a small car. Inside is just ride not too close to the passenger and roomy. I like how it auto locks when you go past 15 mph. Very easy to park and back up.",,
5,Go for it,chacama ,07/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"These current Sentra models are mid The new Sentras rock!. CVT is real smooth and have not had any problems with what some call ""rubberband effect"" (have not experienced it on this car yet!). Before deciding for this car i drove the Mazdas 3 & 5, Toyota Yaris & Camry, a VW and the Nissan Versa but ultimately decided for this car because it's good mileage, driveability and specially comfort... the lines looks somewhat similar to a Lexus.",Steering wheel controls Nice acceleration & cruising Good handling Trunk space with the fold flat 60/40 rear seats Excellent leg and head space for the passengers Supberb road visibility ,Break down that 30 mpg mark
5,Great little car!,lily ,07/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love my Sentra!  We looked at all of the competitors (Corolla, Elantra, Focus) and I found the Sentra to be the nicest and most comfortable.  I love that it has the features of more expensive cars (leather, bluetooth, xm, etc), but it was less than $20000.  It's fun to drive and great for in town and long trips.  And the gas mileage is good too.",,
5,Great Car!,K.S. ,05/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I had the car for about a month and found it easy and fun to drive.  It's just about the right size for both a daily commute and for longer highway trips.  Driver's seat provides good support and the driving position provides for a commanding view of the highway. Please disregard any negative comments you may have read about the interior - it is a classic industrial design.  Just look up industrial design or Raymond Loewy for more info on this design style. Mostly city around town driving averages about 29- 30 MPG     ,"Steering feel, driving position, dash layout.","Security system needs to be modified because if you open the trunk with the key, without first unlocking the doors, you will set off the security alarm. This feature makes it inconvenient to load or unload the trunk when you don't have a need to get inside the car. "
4.25,just got mine today,josefina ,04/12/2009,,,3,4,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"I love my new sentra even though I bought it today.  I got the base model; I love the car overall forget about the Edmunds rating at 7.1 I'll give it a 10! Interior is easy to use comfortable love the auxiliary input jack, although a little bit pricier than its competition its still worth it. Has a lot of power to be a 2.0liter 4 cylinder I love velocity &its really fast & ideal for daily commute.  Its also fun to drive.","Comfortness, good looking style, auxiliary input jack.",Lower base price & better fuel economy. Not as much & nissan get that 7.1 average higher.
3.875,2009 Sentra S,A.S. ,04/08/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,3,"This is a good car and there are good cash back recession incentives.  But here is why I think consumer reports lists owners to be less than satisfied.  When switching vent from defrost to vent or floor, the A/C automatically activates.  This cannot be deprogramed to function like a normal car.  Routinely end up driving with A/C on in the winter. I'll adapt, but it's frustrating.  Back seat seat belt connector very rigid, difficult for kids to buckle w/ booster seat.  Not great maneuverability in parking lots.  Fuel mileage in city is much less than estimated - highway is good.",Spacious comfortable quite ride. Good price.,Reprogram the vents so driver is not turning off A/C every time it's switched from Defog/frost.  Make backseat belt connector more flexible - I think large adults may have a fitting problem as well.
