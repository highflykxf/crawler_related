1,Buyer Beware,Robert Nutting ,07/29/2016,1,1,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,"Audi's have a airbag recall.  We found out when we were trading ours in to purchase a new Lincoln MKX.  I called Audi and checked online and at this moment there is no fix!!!  And they have until December 2019 to find a fix.  So, we have decided to lose thousands and trade it in anyway.  I feel like we were robbed by Tanaka and robbed by Audi.  Buy American!!",,

The owners before us were very meticulous, and they had very few issues, and we have now put 6,000 miles on it and still have had no problems. The review that complains about having to replace the brakes at 30k is driving in the city constantly, I can tell because they also had to have the carbon build-up cleaned. Carbon build-up is a fact of life for direct injected engines, but when the car is driven at highway speed, the combustion chamber gets hot enough to burn off the carbon. Also, take care of your car. Change the oil with VW 502 00 approved oil every 5,000 miles, and keep up on scheduled maintenance.

Now the bad news. Quality issues from day one. Spent more time in the service shop than in my garage. Had issues with audio system, numerous unexplainable warning lights that pop up and go away on their own. Head gasket leaks after 6 months. I don't believe I bought a lemon.

I myself and two other acquaintances all bought Q5's last spring or summer.  Between the 3 cars, none of us have experienced a single problem with any of them, and I have put 16,000 miles on in the first year alone.  I had leased several Lexuss prior, and was reluctant to change brands specifically because I was worried about reliability: I did, and have never been happier.  This car is gorgeous, comfortable and has more features than I could get in the Lexus for a comparable price- and as of now, the Audi is more reliable!

Have owned it for 30 days and haven't regretted my choice yet. Overall quality, fit & finish, drivability are outstanding.

4,Buyer beware of water pump issues,Mark ,04/24/2010,,,5,5,3,2,,5,4,3,5,"I have been very happy with my Audi Q5 until today.  Had car towed into dealership after the coolant burst in the engine compartment.  I pretty much lost all coolant - luckily i was about to park it in the garage.  Found out today that the water pump failed at 7,800 miles.  It is covered under warranty but warranty or not this is a major issue.  I have so far seen a mass of posts with the same issue.

The Q5 has the luxury of the A6 and the nimbleness of the A4 all packaged in a functional SUV. I have wanted a mini SUV for years but they all look like 'soccer mom' cars until the Q5. That's what made the difference. The exterior is so aggressive and sporty vs 'cute'. One touch of the power hatch lift button and I can get my bike in the cargo area or pack up for a road trip.  My husband wanted to keep the A6 and even he admits the Q5 is pretty cool. ,"Exterior styling, panoramic sunroof, auto hatchback button, AWD",A bit more interior luxury - would have liked to have the push button glove box opener and walnut cover on the cup holders like in the A6.

4.875,Audi Q5 - Great SUV!,Phil in Dallas ,09/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My wife in on her second Audi (first an A4, now an A6). I'm the ""designated SUV driver"" in the family. I had a 5 year old Nissan Murano, which performed well and was a good value, but I've always been jealous of my wife's Audi(s). I looked at several mid-sized SUV's as a replacement, but none compared with the Q5. It drives like a sport sedan, with all of the comfort and convenience of a SUV. The size is perfect for getting around downtown and parking spaces, but it feels very large inside.    ","The fit and finish are first class and have a high end feel, as is generally the case with Audi.  The design of the interior can't be beat and overall, a very good use of space. Aggressive looking exterior. ",Agree with other reviewers regarding the large ash tray in the front console. This space would have been much better used as storage for a cell phone or other items.

I came from a Mercedes with every bell and whistle imaginable and with this car, don't miss it.  I agree that the side mirrors are too big and take getting used to. I do also agree the the shifting of the gears when breaking can be a little jerky- I may just need to get used to it. ","Looks, drive, and size. ","Smaller side view mirrors.

4.875,Best In Its Class,Bignewf ,08/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded in my 2004 VW Touareg V8 with 125,000 miles.  I love this new car.  It drives like a dream, a sports car feel with the high ride of an SUV.  The interior is simply elegant (I got the Cinnamon brown leather and deep blue exterior), premium plus with Navigation and 19inch wheels.  My closest choice was the Volvo XC60, which is also a great car, but the MMI system on the Audi is just, well, cool.  The volvo's nav feels very old school and clunky. My only criticism of this car is that when the back seats fold down, there is a gap across the cargo area that a dog's feet could get caught in.  Also, the MMI phone system is a dial rather than buttons and plugging in for voicemail is a pain.","Elegant interior finish, comfort, smooth ride and tight steering.  MMI system is awesome and voice control is pretty accurate and intuitive.",Fix fold down back seats to be flt and remove gap. Fix MMI phone system with touch screen.

Great acceleration (especially in sport mode), and responsive steering. I was really surprised on my first all highway trip (approx 75 miles), when I averaged 29.1 mpg! The ride is a bit bumpy on side street streets. Great access to rear storage due to low entry. Seats fold easily. Bang and Olefsun sound system is awesome. The GPS leaves a lot to be desired. The ""point of interest's"" do not let you choose ANY retail stores. Good luck trying to find nearest Home Depot, Staples, Target, or supermarket- NOT HAPPENING.

STI proved to be too low for driving on VT pot hole roads. So what was out there that would be fun to drive, quick acceleration, a great solid ride, not too fancy in appearance and interior, yet functional? My friends on facebook submitted their suggestions, this is how I came across the q5! In traffic, great visibility, amazing control maneuvering slow pokes. Quiet. An overall sense of being in your own world with its secure solid build. Great turning into parking spaces. The vehicle drives and feels small. We bought the premium model, base with some options which kept the price down. ","Visibility, no blind spots. Massive sun roof. The room! I can fit my road bike in cargo area with seats down flat. Seats are comfortable.

5,Great Crossover SUV,rb ,07/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the Q5 after driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee for the last 5 years. I loved my jeep and hated to give it up but the build quality was poor and gas mileage was terrible.  I wanted a higher quality vehicle that still could function as a SUV but drove well and offered better gas mileage. The Q5 fits the bill. The Q5 has a high ground clearance and decent cargo room. It handles great and Ive been getting 25 MPG + at 75 MPH.  The cabin is quiet, the seats are comfortable and the visibility is very good. This car provides great car performance with the functionality (functions you use 99% of the time) of a SUV. This is one of the best reviewed luxury SUVs on the market and I can see why!",The sunroof is amazing - especially sitting in the back seat! The audio is amazing with the SD and IPOD connections.

3.875,MMI Navigation/Audio annoyance,Joe O ,07/19/2009,,,3,5,4,4,,4,4,4,3,Do not buy the MMI Navigation/Audio system unless you enjoy having it on every time you start the vehicle. You have two choices when starting your car. 1) The display comes on and the radio/media begins playing. OR 2) The display comes on with an Audi advertisement screen and the radio/media is off. Trying to blank the Audi advertisement screen causes the radio/media to come back on. You cannot start the car with the display and audio off. This is extremely annoying! I contacted Audi customer care. The representative verified this operation. I was told this operation is normal and they have no plans to fix it. There is no software/firmware update available to address this problem.,All wheel drive. Good ground clearance for snow.,"Provide a software or firmware update that allows the car be started with a blank MMI screen AND the radio/media system off. Move the headlight switch location.

Audi has really done a good job in engineering this car.  My only complaint is that Audi should include more standard options on a premium plus.  Bang and Olufsen, in my opinion should be standard on a premium plus.  Heated seats are standard but currently there isn't an option for Cool/ventilated seats.  They get really hot in the summer.  For a 40+ thousand dollar car, one would expect more standard options.  If there was a option to score on Value, i would give it a 7 or 8 simply because you can find more options for the price in Cadillacs, Lexus, Acura.

Looked at a lot of different cars and nothing seemed to have everything I wanted until I drove the Audi.  Very good power for a V6, handles well and has a very smooth ride.  Great interior, good cargo space and the sunroof is fantastic.  I've owned 2 Acuras, a 325 and 525 BMW and a Mercedes (which I'll never buy again), and this car meets and/or exceeds those.

This is my first Audi, had test drove the A4 when buying Acura and was not impressed, so almost did not even look at the Q5. Glad I did, this IS THE BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED. Upside, engine is great, street from my house is a hill and a turn against oncoming traffic, the car provides the extra torque in the rear wheel for complete control, ALL other cars has issue with this even BMW 535i also 2009.

Plenty of room for car seats, strollers, groceries, etc. and looks good enough to bring out for a night on the town.  Little nits: side mirrors are too big, auto-dimming rear view mirror dims too often, and brakes are a tad squishy for my taste.   But, I love driving this car.  Best car we've owned.  By far.

Regular Drive mode leaves a little to be desired in first and second but Sport mode (and Triptronic) is where the fun is...0-60 in FAST!  MMI is solid, cargo space may not be as large as some others but that was not a factor for me (don't have 22 kids and 3 dogs to shuttle around), gas mileage seems to be above listed, visibility is very good, steering responsive but not overly sensitive, braking is predictable, road noise is low even on 19s, and the most important factor is that it feels like a sedan and drives like one.","Exterior styling, interior fit and finish, LED DRL, panoramic sunroof, sport mode (quite responsive), Audi Care, power tailgate, doesn't look like an soccer-moms Lexus RX, feels like a sedan in every aspect.","Cost of Prestige package (11k), offer Side Assist for all packages (a very intelligent safety feature - almost a must have for all cars, especially larger vehicles), Advanced Key for all packages, TDI version (hopefully next year)."

Had to pay MSRP because the car is so popular right now - actually had to wait for almost 1 month to get the color I want.  But Audi is now offering 2.9%, 36 months financing and will make my 1st 2 payments, so net net it is like 0% financing + $500 discount.  The car is perfect for my wife.

Styling, interior room, sporty handling and more than enough power. Fuel economy as advertised. Loaded with technology. Was about to purchase an X5. After driving the Q5 and comparing space, feel and price, the Q won hands down. Great car!","Acceleration and feel when engaging the sport drive transmission. Turning ability, look and feel of the dashboard, 3D display graphics, one touch controls.",Tire pressure monitoring system should display actual tire pressures rather than simply provide a warning light. 
4.625,1 Fun SUV,Russ ,05/16/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,5,4,4,5,"We bought this car in April of 09 for my wife and I am ready to take it from her! The car is super fun to drive and especially so in the Sport mode. Has more get up and go than I ever expected. The transmission in the regular Drive mode can be a bit sluggish, but works fine. There is plenty of room in the car, I am 6 foot tall and the person behind me still has an adequate amount of room. Only had the car for a month now, but I am already a big Audi fan.","The MMI is great, 10gig of space on the hard drive for music and 2 SD slots. Great integration with my iPhone 3g, music and bluetooth. The bluetooth works great too, I can hardly tell when my wife is in the car. the sun roof is great too!","The transmission is a little jerky in Drive mode, but everything else they did right."
5,Thrilled with my Q5,Tara L ,05/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had the car two months and couldn't be more satisfied.  I was regretting handing in my BMX X3 (still love that car) but the Q5 is more luxurious, more comfortable, smoother, better gas mileage, and just as fun to drive.   I'm glad to see others here also getting MORE gas mileage than Audi disclosed. I am getting 23/28 vs. the Audi claim of 18/23.  The better mileage + the larger fuel tank = less stops at the pump & a happy driver.  The Q5 handles and drives like a state- of-the-art German sports car.  Thru traffic, Manhattan streets, suburban highways and local driving, it gives a consistent and fun-tastic drive.  And my passengers have no complaints either.  Thanks Audi!","panoramic sunroof, rear passenger reclining seats, ipod interface is wonderful, sporty/sturdy drive",Rear hatch is very heavy. A little more front console storage would help. 
5,Q5 is the only way to go!,lostemple ,05/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,My brother needed a new ride and after test driving all competitors bought an Audi Q5 premium plus w/navigation. I followed suit and bought a Q5 premium plus and could not be happier. I am a research junkie and hands down the Q5 beat out the competition. I look forward to many happy years of driving my Q5.,"Panoramic sun roof, quiet cabin, excellent fit and finish, powered tail gate, front and rear led lights, 4400 towing capacity and the audio system.",Bring the off road upgrade accessories to the US. Currently only offered in Europe.
4.375,Poor Gas Mileage,jscotyd ,05/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,1,4,Beware of the ugly gas mileage.  I can only get the 18 mpg in the city on the vehicle instant mpg calculator if I am going down hill with my foot off of the accelerator.  It's stupid.,,
4.875,Impressions of my new Q5,automaven ,05/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I purchased my new Q5 from Audi of Oxnard.  I did extensive research prior to the purchase.  I wanted all wheel drive for skiing plus a place where both my surfboard and lab dog could fit.  I wanted comfort, bluetooth, nav, and pretty much all  goodies.  The full size moon/ sun roof is a cool addition. I replaced my 06 Acura MDX where the lease just ended. The Audi is extremely comfortable, with fit and finish second to none.  Smaller than the mdx, but still o.k. and with better mileage.  I got 23.5 on first tank, city and highway.  The center stack which controls the radio and nav takes some getting used to.",Comfort; fit and finish; looks; moon roof; nav (with 2 screens) parking sensors. Nice wood. Great transmission.,Stack a little difficult to understand.  Needs locking gas cap or door.  More interior storage places.  Nice if Audi paid for service like BMW.
5,Beats 'em all,AudiMyMind ,05/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Test drove BMW, MB, Lexus, Acura and Infiniti. Audi is absolutely the BEST by far. The quality, craftsmanship, fit and finish is beyond compare. Got the Meteor Gray pearl, light gray interior &  Premium plus pkg. Have caused countless head turns on the road and while parked. Those LED daytime running lights really get everyone's attention. Precise handling; Superb ride.",Fit & finish; LED DRLs; MMI; Ipod interface,Improved bluetooth interface. List of cell providers & manufacturers could be better.
4.875,The perfect urban SUV,GLo ,05/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We've driven the Q5 (with Premium Plus) for a month and we absolutely love it.  It's small enough for urban driving/parking, but is roomier and built more intelligently than the X3 that it replaced.  Smooth, linear acceleration, balanced steering, and grips the road like a sports car.  Our favorite drives are over the twisty canyon roads.  MPG is around 17 so far (vs. avg. of 13 with the X3), which is better than expected considering almost 100% city driving.  My only complaints are that the brakes are a bit squishy and the side view mirrors are huge. This is great for side visibility, but limits front visibility a bit when making turns, for example.  I think we'll get used to it.","Handling, power, MMI, passenger space, cargo space (movable 2nd row seats are simply awesome), power liftgate, LED lights, Audi ergonomics.",Braking. Everything else is exactly what we'd hoped for.  
5,"""The best""",cesar ,05/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had 2 Mercedes (Ml320 and E320) and my Q5 is much better in everything, I traded in a 08 MDX that I bought because Honda and Acura reputation, but  I had to take the MDX 3 times to dealership to fix A/c and I recently discovered a noise on the transmission, so I decided - That's it!! and bought the Q5. I could not be happier with it.","Great pick up, stereo, inside finish, great design, smooth ride, great pick up etc., etc., etc.","Nothing, is perfect!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Absolutely Perfect! ...no comparison! ,megn1806 ,04/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just bought the q5 with the premium plus pkg, and it's FANTASTIC! The gas mileage is better than advertised. The LED lights are awesome! It handles just like a vehicle, but with the stamina of an SUV. I am 5""4 and this car doesn't feel 'too large'. The interior is classy, and goes above and beyond all of the competition. I have been looking for a year for an SUV (MB, BMW, Lexus), and nothing comes close to the genius Audi put together with the Q5. I leased this vehicle, but after driving it for 2 weeks, I am quite certain I'll end up purchasing it @ lease end. If you haven't driven the Q5, add it to the top of your list, this is one vehicle that is a must drive! ","LED lights, panoramic sunroof, Ipod display screen, self-closing trunk, beautiful interior!! ",None! This car is perfection! 
5,Perfectly sexy!,wilduys ,04/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Q5...truth in engineering equals driving fun. Sexy inside & out.Truly a head-turner! Behind the  wheel is perfectly engaging. Driving one is more than an ultimate experience. Q5 is the ultimate expression of PERFECTION! Owning one is a dream come true.,MMI-awesome! Bang & Olufsen-out of this world! Panoramic sunroof-WOW!

4.875,Audi q5 premuim plus,jim ,04/11/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Been looking for about a year on a crossover that my wife & I would like. The Q5 has a very nice exterior look to it. The interior is comfortable for a person that 6'5"". The Q5 has more than enough get up & go to it. Gas mileages is not bad (19 mpg). Traded in a XC90 Volvo.   ","Moonroof, Wheels, Led headlights & tail lights  ","Handle for adjusting steering wheel, center console that's adjustable gets in way of cup holder, cruise control in occurred place."
5,Would Never Buy American Again!,Bill B. ,04/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After trading in my 06 Jeep Grand Cherokee for a 09 Q5 Prestige, I can honestly say i would never buy an American car again.  The Q5 is far better than the Jeep in every way, especially in the snow.  We test drove this car during a snow storm and wow, the quattro is amazing.  It would not let us fishtail or slide at all, and it just kept us going in a straight line.  Aside from that, the MMI is pretty easy to use, the Bang & Olufsen sounds great and the panoramic sunroof is amazing, the whole roof is pretty much glass.  Last but not least, the LED's both front and rear look incredible.  They were one of the main reasons I bought this car.","Front LED's and Rear LED's, the Quattro, the panoramic sunroof, the interior, the keyless go...the list goes on and on.","None, this car is perfect to me."
5,Bullseye!!!,Don L. ,04/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Traded in my Infiniti M35X.  Have always been a fan of Japanese car quality but decided to try a German car.  The school commercial captivated my attention as I was considering an Lexus RX350.  The commercial helped me to realize that I should try something not so main stream as there are a lot of Lexus RXs out there.  One test was all it took to blow me away.  The Q5 drives and feels like a sport sedan as handling and acceleration are excellent.  The build quality is phenomenal.  Seats are extremely comfortable.  The  gas mileage has been higher than advertised as I am getting just over 27 mpg on the highway (at 65-70 avg speed) vs sticker which claims 23.  You can't get a much better car.,"Bang and Olefson Stereo (absolutely worth the upgrade), Latest generation MMI system is useful and intuitive, Panoramic sunroof, quattro six speed transmission, quality and finish of interior, LED daytime running lights and tailights, utra smooth 3.2 liter engine, exhaust sound, steering feel","Add additional cup warmer/cooler for passenger.  Other than that, Audi hit the bulls eye squarely with this cross over for the U.S. market and kudos to the ad agency who put together their commercials as they lured me into the showroom!"
5,Prestige - S-Line,Toni ,04/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just recently purchased the car.  As an understatement, it is absolutely perfect.  Excellent engine response and handling.  The navigation system and audio commands are superior. I drove several competitors, i.e., Lexus X350, MB M500, Infiniti X35, and the Q5 is by far the best of the lot.  If one is looking for a high performance Crossover vehicle, I HIGHLY recommend the Audi Q5.",*Navigation System *Voice command *Bang & Olufsen Stereo System *270 HP/V-6,"Perfect, as is"
5,Great car with all the features you want,George ,03/31/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Traded our Acura TSX for an Audi Q5 and could not be happier with the choice. The Audi Q5 does not handle like your normal SUV and it gives us better mileage so far in the City and on Highway driving with way more storage room than the Acura TSX and ability to haul more stuff. I would certainly recommend this car to anyone looking for a smaller SUV, a lot of fun, power and style.","Panorama Sun roof, bluetooth, ipod connectivity.",Change the red highlights on the dash when driving at night to a color softer on the eyes but no biggie.
5,Can't Get Much Better!,Jay Norton ,03/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This isnt going to be your typical car review. This one is taking on a new twist, its from the front passengers viewpoint. MS took driving away from me 19 years ago, but Im still more than able to be the judge of a vehicles stature and quality. Back in 2001 I purchased an Audi Allroad. It was an exceptional car, and always a head-turner.  We recently traded it in on a 2009 Q5, and so far we have no regrets. The quality, detail and build is typical Audi""First-Class"". Front seaters well over 6 ft in height have plenty of leg/headroom to spare. The 270hp V6 has enough punch to easily set you back in your seat. The shifting is very smooth and so is the ride. The Q5 also turns heads.","Love that QUATTRO, it just loves curves, rain and snow. The MMI/Nav system is excellent and easily accessible. The LED running lights are a real nice touch. They help make the Q5 stand out from all other midsize suvs that you see on the road.","None, I believe that Audi really did their homework on this new crossover, and they get an A+ in my opinion."
4.875,Our Sunday Car,Brandon Smith ,03/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My wife and I just purchased the Q5.  It was quite a trade up from a Toyota Corolla. The interior styling is far superior to its Mercedes and BMW competitors.  All three trims are great, and the Prestige is amazing.  All three trims have the same engine - which has all the power we'd ever need.  It has all the bells and whistles.  ","Panoramic Moonroof, Bang and Olufsen sound system.  Simple, yet versatile steering controls.",A coin storage compartment.  Have the front cup warmer/cooler be available for the passenger as well.
5,Traded S5,Michelle D. ,03/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I traded our S5 in on the Q5 and honestly the quality and build is the same. We've owned the Acura RDX and Toyota's Higlander in the past this vehicle is by far superior. We have owned BMW's before and looked at the X3 we are glad we waited. This vehicle gives us some of the performance we enjoyed in the S5 without all of the attention we got in the S5,we get some but not as much.It also gives us the comfort of the S5 with greater cargo space. You forget you're riding in a SUV. We've only had it a couple of weeks, we'll stick with Audi.I miss the B&O :( .",The MPG in the city 23-26 Yes! On the highway 29.6 at 70 MPH and 30.5 at 65 MPH Yes! The third generation MMI/Nav is excellent and the handling. It's got to get better its not even broken in.,"This is our second Audi, Audi AG should give us our third one at half price. Well! you asked :)."
