4.75,Evo no Longer,evonomore ,12/01/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,5,5,The vehicle is the only vehicle that could have made me purchase an American car. The power is incredible but it can be driving within reason with ease. On the road from Indiana to Kansas City I got 21.6 miles to the gallon with an average speed of 76 miles per hour. I am very impressive by the features but need to return to dealership to have some trim items tightened up. Slightly smaller steering wheel like the sie in my Evo X Mr that I traded would be perfect. The engine sounds so good and did I mention the POWER!!!. Plus the insurance on this vehicle is less than my 2008 Evo Mr. Go Caddy!!!,Bluetooth HD based audio system Standard Sat Radio,Get workers to pay better attention to fit and finish. With more attention to fit and finish and slightly higher quality trim bits Lexus would be very very worried
4.875,My first luxury sedan is a CTS- V!!,Dave ,11/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is awesome and I never thought I would buy American until I researched the CTS V. It has power, great handling, and beautiful interior and exterior. The navigation system, on star, and satellite radio are awesome. The electronics are pretty complex to me since I have driven my Honda Accord for 12 years. I read a little bit every night to understand the electronics of the CTS V. This car has so much to offer, and the pricing was too competitve for me to pass up.","The exterior paint, interior, power engine, on star, navigation system, satellite radio,handling.",Maybe needs a lock for the gas cap.

4.875,Happier Than Ever,Ray D. ,11/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Last post - Great car with radio turned up.  After 2k miles, I simply love this car - almost weapon-like.  I couldn't resist the Lingenfelter upgrade to 630hp / 630ft/tq - went out the other night with car - nobody on road.  Rolling start from 40 mph then I floored it - the acceleration blew my mind - handling and steering extremely well balanced for the weight of this car.  I am so pleased that there is nothing else out there that compares for under 100k.  ","Exterior, interior, handling, ride",Needs 20X11 wheels for rear - I can't think of anything else.
4.875,Incredible Sleeper,Jmos77 ,11/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I just traded my M3 for the CTS-V and the car is simply amazing.  THe power and torque are scary at times and the magnetic suspension offers a perfect balance of comfort and touring.  This is by far the fastest car I have ever owned so be prepared to buy a radar detector for keeping this car at speed is impossible.  The biggest surprise for me is how beautiful the interior is.  The hand stiched dash and the ambient light along with the skyview sunroof makes for a fantastic place to spend time.  The fit and finish are very surprising as well and I love the white diamond paint on my car. Bottom line GM hit a homerun and if you need a 4 fast sedan then look no further.  Can't beat the price too,"Power, TORQUE, Ambient light in dash, adaptive headlights, white diamond paint, Navigation screen, Ipod interface, Skyview sunroof, Magnetic suspension, POWER, TORQUE, POWER TORQUE.  Interior is very classy looks fantastic, surprisingly good handling, exhaust note,  THE PERFECT SLEEPER, BUY ONE","This car needs a backup camera, BOSE stereo not as good as others I have heard, Wider rear tires for traction, Standard seats are comfy but need more lateral support, sterring is a little too vague even in sport mode, slight drone when in 6th gear.

4.625,Lovin my V,Lovin the V ,10/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"What else can I say other than, ""I absolutely love this car.  Wahoo!!!"" ",The acceleration is my favority feature.  The nighttime interior lighting is way cool.  ,"Cell phonebook interface would be great enhancement.  Audi's MMI would be a good benchmark to strive for.  And, most importantly, a rear view camera please..."
4.5,Awesome car with radio turned up,HappywithGM ,10/13/2009,,,4,5,3,5,,5,5,4,5,"Traded in 2008 BMW M3 coupe for full boat 09 CTS-V auto.  Have been watching this car prior to ever purchasing the M3 but needed more space - so I made the move.  Looks are terrific and simply unparralled by the competition.  What I did notice about this car is the obvious thrust / torque that goes with its monster engine.  But I noticed that the car starts to handle and steer better as you increase speed.  The suspension seems to set-up better, steering more response and crisp.  My only grip is (don't forget, coming out of M3) is that there are a lot more creeks and noices coming from interior parts and the seats.  Great car for GM, yes, DNA of the best cars on the road, not yet. ","Recaro seats a must, exterior styling, wheels","Pad interior parts to reduce noise, ad a little more weight to steering effort - a little numb.  That's it"
4.875,"""Life, liberty & the pursuit""",Ziggerman ,10/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Finally pulled the trigger on the CTS-V as I could not refuse the almost $11,000 in discounts GM offers at this time on this model year.  I cannot comment on reliability, yet, but I can tell you that you should NOT test-drive it unless there is a chance that you can afford to buy it. My test drive took 20 minutes with a smiling sales guy pressed into the seat and it was the most visceral and yet sublime experience I ever had in an automobile.  External styling, interior, engine, suspension, brakes, steering feel, infotainment system...everything is a work of art. Cadillac absolutely hit a home-run and may have made the finest American car ever.","Engine, engine, engine...556HP, 551 torque, engine, engine, 6.2l V8... :) :)  The question on this car is rather what is NOT your favorite....","Radar cruise control, HUD, rear-view camera."
4.625,New Meaning To Driving!,Barry ,07/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"Now my 21st car & all else in past fails compared to my new CTS-V. I had my doubts with a American made car & it's quality.I wasn't sure I needed this much HP? I for sure never spent over $70,000 for any car before, until now! All I can say is this car is a work of art & gives new meaning to sport & luxury! I'm thrilled I bought it & it's worth every penny!!","Inside is just gorgeous, love the suede.Navigation is excellent compared to most cars.Ipod works terrific & sounds great! Cooled seats are nice.

4.375,I can't believe this is an American car,neuronbob ,07/29/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,2,5,"I am a 20-year loyal Honda/Acura buyer, so I bought this car with some trepidation as I have high expectations from my cars.  I am NOT sorry I bought this car four months and 4500 miles ago, trading up from my beloved Acura RL.  It lives up to EVERY bit of hype heaped upon it in the auto media.  It is FAST, it is QUIET inside, the interior is high-quality, and the car is STEALTHY in that cops won't notice this car AT ALL.  The torque is everywhere you want it to be.  There are few buttons and they are large and intuitive.  I didn't buy the car for gas mileage but it sure could use another gallon in the tank.  Range is 240 miles in mixed 50-50 city/freeway driving, less when fooling around.","STEALTH car!  TORQUE everywhere; excellent exterior styling; relatively few buttons, simply laid out; regular seats are so comfortable; usable trunk; awesome brakes; large moonroof; Magnetic Ride Control; it drives like a Cadi when the wife is around, drives like a beast when she's not.","Needs another gallon in the gas tank STAT; refine Bluetooth so that phone calls take fewer commands like in my previous Acura; locking gas cap; Edmunds needs to correct the review choices-- 2009 CTS-V has 6AT and 6MT, and I own the 6AT."

Car is a blast, but traction is an issue, even in 104 degree weather. Just have to get over the fact that you can't floor it in 1st or 2nd in any weather without blowing the tires completely. 3rd gear hooks up in 90+ degree weather, and we'll see about cooler days this fall! Interior is very nice, but there is a bit more interior noise than in an audi I owned. 14-15 MPG average really isn't that bad for a 600HP sedan. Gadgets are very nice. The 8 inch nav touch screen is impressive. Excellent toy if scaring three passengers on the way to lunch is your cup of tea!",The manual transmission is pretty much perfect.,Larger tread in the back (325s would likely hook up better). Lose the highly restrictive intake and exhaust (that's what I did to gain 57HP to the ground)!

Strap yourself down, select the manner in which you choose to drive and take off!  I do wear my silk scarf when ever I can before taking off.  Power, speed, and control at levels unheard of with a production line manufactured 4 door sedan - bar none!  Then there are the looks.  Talk about a phallic symbol on a testosterone high.

Sheer power, handling, and the excellent overall build is fantastic. If you have an M5 shame on you for not buying American steel, and to top if off the Cops do not have a clue about this  vehicle.  Can blow the doors off most anything on the road and the stealth factor kicks hindend.","Navigation system  rocks, and the interior is so well appointed, and designed taillights are also sun like.

They drive by all the time looking at the CTS badge not having a clue.  I keep looking straight ahead and be good on the street, as impossible as it is to be good.

I have had two BMW-M's, two Mercedes SL's and about 9 Corvettes and none measure up.  This car really lives up to the hype and then some.

5,Hottest production ride - EVER,Joe ,03/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have two Corvette's.  One built by Chevrolet ('77, L-82, 350/350 coupe) and one by Cadillac ('09, CTS-V, Touring Sedan).  Guess which one is faster and more powerfull, but not quite as slick looking - just by a little bit?  There is not a Beamer or Mercedes worth the 30 to 40k more I'd be willing to pay for their prestige.  Besides the Corvette Touring Sedan -V looks much cooler that either of them, especially out of my rear view mirror.  Been there done that many times before and they flat out ain't worth it.  Nor the 110K, at least, needed to purchase the coupe version of my CTS-V, i.e., ZR-1.      ","Horsepower, torque, transmission, Brembo breaks, electronics, Recaro seats, wheels/tires, and overall looks.  But most of all: bang for the buck!  Thank you Cadillac and GM.  ","More horsepower and torque for the same money, i.e., just drop a LS9 into it.  Leave the rest alone!  O.K. I'll pay $2,500 more.  3,000 tops?  If possible: add European package - differential oil cooler and side turning signals also - to US version."
5,The perfect car has arrived,Jim A ,01/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"There is no better automobile for the money than this four door supercar. How would you like to buy a 4 door, 110,000 ZR-1 with better seats and interior for 65-70,000? Of course you would.... and you can.

4.75,American Know How,Chris ,01/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"This car is great, luxury, features, performance, roomy and did I mention performance. The ride is very smooth and controlled no mater how you drive it. It is not as loud as you might expect from a performance sedan and just a joy to drive. The quality is as good as you can get and I have found no problems with it.  The performance is off the scale, the Recarro seats are fantastic and the interior is well layed out and functional, not to mention beautiful.  I have gotten an average of 11.4 MPG since I bought it but this is not a hybrid. This is my dream car, thanks Cadillac for making my dream come true and providing such a great example of ""Good Ol American Know How"".","Suspension and drive train performance are flawless for hot rodding or cruising. Stereo, navigation system, and bluetooth work and sound great. Great looks both in and out. Keyless entry and ignition are fantastic and can be configured to suit based on individual needs.

When the bluetooth is configured you can receive calls automatically but in order to make handsfree calls using your phones address book your have to configure it every time.

5,Best performance sedan value in world,Jim A ,01/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I first drove this car at Monticello in a marketing event. I was hooked. I bought the loaded Reacaro version with an automatic and I can tell you: this car is the real deal. It is a beast on the road and a beauty to behold. Loaded with luxury, handles lke a much lighter car, and will simply plant your head and body in the back of your seat whenever you ask. Here's a little secret: the ZR-1 engine is in this pup. You can easily get this engine to produce way more horsepower. In fact GM built it in such a way that it almost begs to be upgraded. A pulley here, new headers and cat back there, tune the tranny and engine, and there is nothing under 100k that can catch this car. Buy if you dare.","Power. Comfort, luxury, handling. Beauty","Add back up camera; take the crimps out of the exhaust pipes and let it breathe; retune the engine for better gas mileage, raise the rev limiter, cut the weight, make a coupe out of this critter and wave bye bye to the M6, CL63, McClaren Benz, and every other car other than a ZR-1 for less than 150k"
