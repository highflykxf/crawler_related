3,Disintegrating interior,R Miller ,03/07/2016,3,4,1,,,4,4,4,3,,,"Bought a used 2009 Sportage in NBA December with 65K miles. Almost immediately,  the passenger door lock froze. Had to have that repaired to be able to use the door. The interior light sunglass holder is breaking up. Both plastic light buttons have come off and bits broken off and the latch for the sunglasses has broken off. It will cost $165 just for the part. I don't think I'm excessively hard on cars; I just let go of a 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe with 235K miles that I'd bought new and never had these issues. I had heard great things about Kia the last 10 years, but I am very disappointed and will not buy another.Update - now the windows will not roll up from the driver's door controls.",,

4.5,ESC light is on,michelle ,08/10/2010,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,5,5,I really like this car. I replaced a 2002 Chevy trailblazer with my Kia. I think it's a good choice. That car was junk. Recently my esc off light is on. Any suggestions other than take it to a dealer. It isn't doing anything funky or making any noises. It came on after a bad rain storm. It comes on after about a mile a 2 has passed. Other than that its a great vehicle.,Its cute. stereo. satellite radio.,more plush interior. more room.

The sportage is very solid, no issues at all. The sportage has been a great commuter car and family work horse. Between commuting and getting the kids off to there sports, this car has been great. plenty of storage in the back with enough room to travel with 5 people. I find The 4 cylinder 2.0 liter engine adequate. Its not a rocket but gets me where i have to go. The 5 speed makes the sportage fun to drive. The outside finish is still as shiny as the day i got it. No issues at all , none. I do all of the required maintenance through the dealer. Easy to maintain. Great car!","Love the 4 wheel drive, safety features, roof rack, storage and satellite radio. Excellent warranty and great value and quality.

It's cute, way more economical than my Jeep was and super reliable in terms of the engine. After a year, however, the left rear side is creaking like an old house & like another reviewer said, my back hinge is rusting off and I have to get another. The hinges were on back order so this is a common problem apparently. The interior is cheap, you can't go in there without scratching it. Great engine, love the look and simplicity of it, but the rest is not holding up to my expectations at the moment. I don't think a car should have ANY problems after a year, just saying. Overall I still love it.","Simple efficient interior, outside design(so much better looking than the Tuscon), standard features, great dealership(so far, we'll see), price and warranty. Reliable-drove it back and forth from college in rain, sleet and snow with no problems. ","I hope they fixed things for the 10-11 models, such as outdated transmission & the cheap interior materials. If they have I would consider trading in my 09 because I do love this car & fixing some things would make it perfect in my opinion. But who is to say 10-11 models won't have other problems?"

4.5,Great SUV for the price.,br2000nc ,06/10/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"We bought the Sportage because it was thousands cheaper than the rest of the compact SUVs and has a better warranty. Kia was also offering a $2000 rebate at the time. Have about 27k on it and so far it has been great. posted fuel economy is 20/25/23, we live in the country and average about 26 mpg, not bad. The only disappointment so far is the tires. They already need to be replaced. The 2.0 I4 is ok at highway speeds but acceleration is a little slow. Get the V6 if you want the 4WD model. Other than that it's a great SUV at a great value.","Keyless entry, mp3/usb input standard, reclining back seats.",Drop the 2.0 and use the 2.4 with the 5 speed auto. More cargo room. Better tires.

Lost reception in the city all the time. Dealership replaced stereo, didn't fix it. Replaced wiring, didn't fix it. Replaced antenna, didn't fix it. Installed an aftermarket FM Modulator, didn't fix it. They hacked up my dashboard with their tools. 8 months later, countless calls to Kia Canada. Nothing has been fixed. The car hasn't started 5 times since I bought it brand new. The hinges on the back liftgate began to degrade and caused rust streaks down my back window.

I am 6'4"" and get uncomfortable driving most vehicles for long hours at a time. This Sportage was extremely comfortable during 10 hour driving times.  I truly believe the Korean automakers (Kia/Hyundai) are meeting the needs of consumers these days.  I now have 15,000 miles on my Kia with absolutely no problems.

So far we are very happy with purchase and living in Central Illinois we have had the opportunity to drive under all extreme conditions. Sportage passed them all with flying colors. Plenty of room and quite comfortable to drive.,"Handles well. The luxury package additions are all great additions to have.

The 4 wheel drive system has been great in NH winters. I'm able to go up some steep hils during snow storms that normally would not be able to navigate. Sportage is very roomy, gas mileage has been consistant around 25-27MPG.  The only issue I had was a faulty steering sensor which the dealership fixed right away. The Sportage has been trouble free. Too bad I can't say the same for my civic. Seating is comfortable. Just found out that you can adjust the head rests and the rear seats recline back.  Still great value and bery happy with my purchase. This is the perfect comuter vehicle and family car","Love the 4 Wheel drive system, back seats fold flat without taking the head rests off.

Very roomy inside and I will say for the warranty and price no other car in its class can beat it.  It says alot about the manufacturer to put a 5 yr 60k mile warranty on their vehicle they must not be expecting a bunch of big issues.  One thing I would change would be to have a better (taller) armrest and a bit less plastic in the car, but the sat radio and ipod jack are awesome.  Power seats standard on driver side would be cool, also a little less cabin noise its louder then my Nissan but hey its an suv   But I bought this for practicality so for that it gets a 10.  I hope it continues to make me happy","Sat radio, ipod jack, fun to drive, roomy interior, stability control. good on gas compared to others in class. 5 star safety rating.  Good insurance rate (mine went down) bumper to bumper warranty.","Transferable power train, better armrest or a drivers side armrest. power driver side seat.  Better sounding speakers(need more power)..Maybe a bit less plastic on the inside. Still learning what it has but an oil monitor and tire monitor if it doesnt have it. and less cabin noise. "

This vehicle is fine looking and fun to drive. I guess I had hoped for better fuel economy but at 21 MPG, it isn't bad. I agree with other reviewers...miss my armrest, the vehicle could shift more smoothly and I would like to have a guage for the eng. temp instead of an idiot light. I also would like the outside temp reading but that is not of great significance. Mine has everything but the nav system, and that is because I have an excellent portable that is cheaper to upgrade. AWESOME RIDE for the price!!! Could not have made a better deal!!!!! The warranty, GREAT!","The sound system, air bags that do not activate unless they have to.

I was told it would take 4 days, then told up to two weeks and today, due to back order it could take up to 2 months to replace.  Refurbished because they say that is all the Kia offers. And forget about calling ""customer care"" they do nothing to get the matter resolved, they just confirmed there was a back order of refurbished radios and there was nothing they could do. I would have to wait.  I suggested getting a radio from a vehicle on the lot, no can do, they said. By the way, I will need a new dash since I now have three screw driver marks and scratches that were left on the dash.","None at this point, I find no pleasure in driving a vehichle waiting for another new part to go, only to be replaced with a refurbished one.",Kia should truly commit to customer service.

I have long been dreaming for an SUV, but didn't expect to find one in the $15K price range I was aiming for. Stumbled upon the Kia dealership, and was impressed with the RAV4 & Forester matching features of the Kia in such an affordable package. I've had it for 3 weeks now and am overall impressed. Horsepower is a bit lacking, but fuel economy is decent (23 mpg on my first tank, 90% city). Handling is secure, if not sports-car-like.

This is my second KIA, I find the quality is excellent. The sportage also has plenty of storage and room to handle my 3 kids and their gear. I owned a 07 Honda, i find the finish superior on the Kia.

The seating layout and flexibility is well done providing real flatbed storage. The transmission is smooth. I wish that KIA offered a larger tyre option, but it is not a major flaw. The finish and engineering are of high quality. The entertainment system, bluetooth and component inputs make offer more luxury features than are found on many prestige cars. I was surprised and disappointed to find an ashtray, GPS space would be better.",Overall interior configuration and finishes are excellent. Entertainment system and its component and bluetooth options are superior.,Remove the ashtray and make the space available for an after market GPS. Offer a greater tyre and wheel size option. Provide more flexibility in placement of the headrests.

I love it!",Make adjustable headrest

Kia has a great 4 wheel lock and all wheel drive feature on the Sportage that exeeds our expectations.,"Bigger tires would be appropriate on this vehicle, the rear seat should have cup holders that are more accessible."

4.875,Impressed,Me ,02/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I was very hesitant about buying a Kia, for I have not heard very good things about them in the past. I searched several SUVs and for the price w/ 60K warranty the Sportage is a real bargain! The car is great on gas as long as your foot is not permanently heavy and the seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of space - just as much as the Sorrento and its better on gas. The stereo is very good for factory.  My main complaint is there is not arm rest !! So far I love the car.",Back seat lean back and the seats are very comfortable.,NO ARM REST !!

4,Good catch,me ,02/16/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I was looking for an affordable SUV that was not a gas guzzler. The mileage is not as good as the Jeep Patriot, but for this price the Sportage is a real bargain. If your foot isn't heavy all the time, you can easily get 22-24 MPG. Kia product has dramatically improved since Hyundai bought them out. ",Back seats lean back for snoozing.,"No arm rest in the LX! Also, keyless entry would be nice. "

4.875,A $16K 6cyl 4x4,Laura ,01/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"What is not to like about a quality 4x4 6 cylinder SUV for $16K.  Electric windows, power locks, cd player, excellent in the snow.  Only one problem was the right side power mirror stopped working. Will wait for a month and see if any other little things pop up.  The best deal is a 10 year / 100,000 mile warranty.  Come on now see if you can come close to Toyota and Honda with this kind of deal.  I researched this hard before I bought and I am please as punch to get this great car.  Time will tell how it stand up but so far so good.","Warranty, price, 4x4, comfort",Remote door lock and opener on the LX.
