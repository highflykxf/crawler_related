4,"Great nibble, smooth and fast mini-van.  Love it!!",PapaC ,12/10/2016,,,,,,,,4,4,,,"I bought this minivan brand new in Alaska because we just had a baby girl.  Being Alaska I needed something with all wheel drive and very comfortable.  So the Sienna was the only minivan with that option.  Drove it cross country when we moved to North Carolina.  Use it for long distance trips for the first 3 years.  Then as my commuter to work and school, wife and daughter falls asleep in it all the time even short trips...  I've rented the Dodge minivan and it feels heavy like the truck frame its built on.  The Sienna is more like a car, nibble and fast, out drive a lot of others on the road.  I've even towed a pop-up camper several times, only need a electric brake installed since I got the hitch package on it which is just the hitch frame, nothing else special with it.   It was doing great until a guy hit us from the side and had to replace with whole front driver's wheel assembly.  Had other repairs later on but due to the accident.  At 45,000 miles had to replace all the break pads and at 50,000 has to replace the shocks and struts but since I tow with it I understand that.  Overall a great minivan.  If you want more bells and whistles then you need to really look at each version of this model but that is with any vehicle.  Other minivan have better storage area but that does add to the weight in my thought on it.  Also, to those about the expensive to repairs, if you do go to the dealer its going to cost you more no matter what but in my opinion if you want something done right with out too much hassle then go to the dealership, since they work on that type of vehicle all the time so they use to it.",,

5,7 Years in.... Will never go without AWD!,Lee ,10/15/2015,4,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,As a Mercedes E63 owner I can not believe that my best vehicle I've ever owned is our Sienna AWD limited 2009. After 7 years of family fun - I have no complaints. we have decided to keep it for years to come and purchase a new Sienna as our long trip vehicle using the older one for day to day and teaching the now teenager to drive. I'm  writing more to focus on the AWD version - we are a mini van family - but  the Sienna was our first AWD - purchased for the occasional trips to mountains for sking - but to the contrary we use it almost every day!!! Turning a sharp right turn into a highway - no problem - no spinning front tire - wet pavement  - wow amazing control.,,

Everything seems to need to be replaced just as the warrenty runs out - brakes, tires, etc.. This spring (only 1 1/2 year old car) the left passenger door broke and recently at less than 2 years old the right side broke. The estimate is over $4000 to fix them. Thereason I was told is that we drive too much. Dealer informed us that we should only be driving 13k miles per year.  ",,Parts that last longer. Recently read that the average suburban commuter drives 32k miles per year; we live in the country. Make a car that lasts longer or up the warrenty.

Occasionally when starting the van, the JBL stereo lights are off and the volume knob won't work.  Using volume on the steering wheel seems to correct it.  Engine is a little loud, seems like a loud exhaust note at times, but quiet when cruising.  Tires wearing quickly.  Only 17 mpg in city driving.  People don't hear us well on Bluetooth, cheap no-name aftermarket is better.","Power doors and lift gate, deep trunk space behind third row, built-in sunshades, smooth quite ride.  For a family van, why look for agility and handling if you must sacrifice a significant amount of quiet and comfort or space?  Especially when the choices with agility and handling are slower?","Slightly bigger 17"" tires or perhaps 18"".  Better quality stereo / bluetooth option.  Easier options packages.  Hood shocks, but the hood is pretty short.  Since it has power doors, and the stereo light is on the blink, I'll look into an extended warranty.  Should have got one before the recalls!"

We didn't need a van when our children were young, but need it for the grandchildren. Two weeks after we purchased the van, we took a 2000 mile road trip. That was when we truly fell in love with this van. We grew to appreciate the comfort of the seats and the handling of the van. It is amazingly easy to park and gets adequate mileage on a trip. We got 26- 28 mpg on a trip. In town we get an average of 20 mpg. We keep wondering why we didn't get a Sienna years ago!","The deep well behind the third seat is perfect for groceries so they can't roll all over. The sliding doors are a plus in a crowded parking lot when buckling the grandchildren. All the seats are so plush, and adults can sit comfortably in every seat with leg room to spare, even the third row seat.","My only complaint is a blind spot with the right outside mirror.

4.625,2nd Time Sienna Owner,rkNE ,05/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"We live in New England.  AWD was important to us in purchasing this van.  Also the crash test results and the awesome reliability record of this van was the deciding factors for us.  The gas mileage is not the best, as noted by several reviewers here.  But you have to consider that this is a large vehicle with a large V6 engine AS WELL AS AWD option.  The AWD adds 2 or 3 hundred pounds to the weight of the vehicle.  The gas mileage will suffer.  If you want higher mileage, you can go with the FWD option, or get a smaller vehicle.  The vehicles drives beautifully, it has a tighter turning radius than most mid-size sedans, it is relatively quiet on the road, and handles well for a minivan.","Power sliding doors and hatch, grocery hooks in the hatch, fold down rear seats, flip up middle row seats, awesome stereo (optional), DVD player (optional), leather upholstery, bluetooth, LOTS of storage and cup holders, access to the middle and rear seats, roll-down windows on the sliding doors","Power seats should have memory buttons, the middle seats should be on rails to make them easier to move; as it is now you have to pick them up and put them down in the new position and there is only two positions available;  All in all very happy with our purchase and would recommend this vehicle."

The XLE with leather interior looks as good as any luxury car on the market no matter what you spend. The next surprise is the performance . . . awesome! This 266 hp V6 would blow away 90% of the guys next to you that think they have hot cars. Highway acceleration is every bit as impressive. Ride will match nearly anything on the market. The turning radius is mind-blowing. The negative: Visibility stinks; I've almost had a few accidents! Hood must be propped open to stay up! How cheap on a $30K plus car! Tranny shifts a bit hard at times and has minor surges. Paint chips easily. Needs pinstripe or something to jazz up the outside.,Acceleration at any speed.,Can't see cars next to me.

The engine is more than adequate and powerful, and matches the transmission which is smooth as silk.  I was really surprised by the tight turning radius of the vehicle.

4.5,2009 Sienna AWD - Traded in 07 Odyssey,ConcordSienna ,12/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,1,5,"Just traded in our 07 Odyssey EXL-RES after 1 years use for the AWD option on the Sienna.  We have approx. 500 miles on the Sienna.  Over all the Sienna instrumentation/controls are much more intuitive, hated the Ody instr.  Ody felt big and bulky but did give a very comfortable ride.  Sienna's ride is a bit stiffer but much more responsive, gives the driver a better feel of control and is quite comfortable.  Very good visibility.  Heat on our Sienna is very poor in cold weather (>32F) and never seems to get comfortable in cold.  We do all short hop drives and expected poor mileage but our 14 MPG is a bit ridiculous.  Hope this will change after the break-in. Would not go back to the Odyssey.","AWD, instrumentation, power, visibility and appearance.    ",Get rid of the run flats or at least make them optional.  There is room for a donut spare.  I will be swapping out the run flats as soon as they are worn out.  This was one of the main reasons we initially went with the Odyssey.  Improve the heat and gas mileage.

3.125,A solid feeling car but...,Beca ,12/08/2008,,,3,3,4,3,,3,3,3,3,"We purchased a 2009 Sienna XLE in October.  I never thought to ask if it was winterized.  With the first dusting of snow I skidded around, and found out the antilock brakes do work.  My windows are frozen shut, it is 20 degrees here, but will be getting much colder. So I came home and got into my 13 yr old Ford Windstar, that I did not slide and the windows are not frozen, even though it too is sitting outside. I guess the all ""season tires"" that are OE need replaced for the winter.  And I will have to be sure it is winterized.   The dealers said you can't special order. It seems that for $30,000 you shouldn't have to ""settle",Love the steering wheel controls and duel climate control controls. ,"It would be nice to be able to purchase the options you want. I wanted cloth seats, but ended up with leather. I would have bought an LE but didn't like the front tray used instead of the console. OE tires that are truly all season.  Lubricated locks and windows, as they shouldn't be frozen, yet."

4.625,"Expanding family, so . . . Sienna XLE",Fatguyinalittlecoat ,11/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,3,"We looked at a lot of competitors, 3- row suvs, and felt this gave us the best compromise of function, mileage, features.  It is a quiet, nicely put together ride. It came with the features (DVD, leather, power everything) we wanted. If you have kids and take frequent road trips, this is the way to go. We drove the Nissan, Honda (3x), had a Ford (loud), Mazda5, and checked out the Hyundai but felt this was the way to go after researching and testing. I really liked the Mazda5 but with 2 kids and 1 on the way, we decided a ""full-size"" minivan is what we needed.","1) Dealer-installed DVD player/quiet ride. When the kids are watching a DVD using headphones, parents can actually talk. 2) Power doors/hatch. Crazy how lazy you get after getting used to it. 3) Storage areas, like the one in the door armrest.","The Honda's 2nd row, center seat is pretty cool. An all-weather funk catcher in the back-back would be awesome. These are just nits, really it is a solid, well rounded ride that when I weighed everything (personal Toyota experience, $, features, space) this was an obvious choice."

4.875,Love this van,cammie ,11/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"On a whim, I decided to see about upgrading our 2007 XLE with limited features to a fully loaded 2009 XLE. We lucked out and got a good deal on both the new van and a trade in. There are minor differences to performance which is nice.  However,the upgrades are amazing and so worth it.  I am loving my van.  And the gas mileage is better on the new van than the 2007.",bluetooth and back up camera!,none yet!

5,Great Ride,Raj ,10/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After researching the Honda Odyssey and the Sienna, we decided on the Sienna. Just crossed the 1000+ mile mark and had the first oil change. Great ride from a 300 mile round trip with 4 people and loaded van. Mileage is in the 23 mpg range for combined driving.  We also bought the extended warranty (too many electronic features with navi / DVD / rear camera / sensors that can go wrong) and the maintenance until 55k.","Navi with rear camera, sensors and bluetooth phone, price, comfort for long trips, electric rear door etc",None.

5,Fits Out Needs,utahmom ,09/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Has a very smooth ride and short turn radius.  Good interior storage capabilities compared to other vans we have owned.,Availability of 8 passenger seating option.,Nicer upgrades should be offered with the 8 passenger seat package.  We had to settle for less options because we wanted the 8 seats.

5,Simply The Best,John ,08/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I looked at the Honda Odyssey and The Chrysler T&C and I think the Sienna has them beat by a long shot. I got more features for my money on the Sienna LE. I thought the Sienna rode like a Lexus. The Sienna has a 266HP V6 and it moves this van with some authority. I also get 21 mpg city/26 hiway.,"266Hp 3.5L V6, gas mileage, features, price, Toyota build quality, and comfort.",Make auto lights standard on LE not just XLE and Limited. No other changes needed to me.

5,Simply the Best,Sam ,08/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my 2009 Toyota Sienna a few days ago and already put 200 miles on it. I love driving it, it is very comfortable both the ride and all the seats. The power of the 3.5L V6 is amazing for being in such a big van. I have 200 miles on my van and i just got to a half tank, the engine is not yet broken in yet. The DVD player is clear and it comes with an awesome JBL sound system. I would recommend the Sienna over any minivan. It comes standard with the Toyota Star Safety System, which has VSC, Traction control, ABS, Brake assist, and 7 standard airbags. Go look at one, you won't be disappointed.","Comfortable ride, build quality, 3.5L V6 power, gas mileage, and Toyota reliability.","Make some packages easier to get, I had to really look for the LE I wanted."
