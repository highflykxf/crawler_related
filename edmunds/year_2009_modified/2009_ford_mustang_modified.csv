4,Fun Little Car,Stangdriver09 ,12/08/2016,4,4,3,,,4,4,4,4,,,"I bought my mustang used with around 40,000 miles on it and drove it to over 130,000 miles. This little car is fun to drive and overall I haven't had many problems with it. The only time I was stranded by this car was when the thermostat housing burst on it after driving the car a little hard. This housing is made of plastic which was why it broke, allowing the coolant to go everywhere. I had a coworker help me replace the part with one from NAPA and I haven't been stranded since. I really like the gauges with this car and the aluminium dash. The fabric used to cover the doors started to come unglued and on the driver's side it started to peel back some. Overall, I enjoyed driving this mustang and I would be willing to get another. I used this car as a daily driver so I think it served me well in that aspect. If you have to drive this car in the winter, I suggest placing sand bags in the back and use good tires. I never placed this car in a ditch, so with careful driving it is possible to use this car in the winter.",,

3,A GREAT TWO YEAR CAR,MIKE ,06/25/2016,4,2,3,,,3,4,5,2,,,"It was great when NEW.  However, over time, you will be in the repair shop a lot.  I've done major repairs on the suspension, two clutches, motor mounts, interior panels, wiring, etc.  The engine is great.  Everything around it lacks quality and durability.  Having TWO separate fuse boxes that overlap in function is beyond frustrating.",,

While the power of the car is still outstanding, and the pricing almost unbeatable, I see issues with the build quality (rattling noises everywhere, parts inside falling off with no apparent reason), as well as the handling (doesn't like sharp turns e.g. @ a traffic light - even when the road is dry! Rain, snow - let's not go there).Seat belt is strangling me (I'm 5.11). Passenger seat can NOT be adjusted for height, so my petite wife doesn't like to drive with me as she almost can't see outside.","Power, price tag","Needs better build quality BADLY, replace the solid rear axle with something that belongs in the 21st century for crying out loud.

I was so impressed with the overall car and how fun it is to drive and it is a real road machine!  It handles great and is just a kick to be in. The seats are super comfortable and I rate this car a 10.,Agile handling and the throaty rumble of the dual exhausts.  ,I honestly can't think of anything I could improve on my car.
4.625,Totally Happy,David Myers ,05/26/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"This is my 8th car and is by far the most enjoyable car ownership experience I've  had. There is absolutely nothing to complain about with the car that I was not aware of when buying it --- the quality of workmanship throughout is excellent, everything is tight and works perfectly. There is only one thing I dislike about the car, and I knew about it upfront -- the solid axle in back and the consequent compromise in handling. That said, I get so much joy out of owning this vehicle, I can't imagine ever selling it. I LOVE IT!","The comfort, the sound, the overall feel, the looks. Tough to choose.",They've made the improvement in the 2010.
5,Turned a lifetime GM guy into a Ford guy,Mike S. ,01/23/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have owned nothing but GM vehicles all my life. I don't know what GM was thinking with the new Camaro (yuk!) When Ford redesigned the Mustang in 2005, they had my attention. I finally ""flipped"" to Ford after comparing GM and Mopar offerings (I only purchase domestic vehicles - no imports for this guy!)and I could not be more pleased with my decision. I have the best of both worlds. The retro stlying of the sixties classics, but also the outstanding performance, handling, comfort, and reliability of a modern day vehicle. Not to mention, where else can you get this kind of car, brand new, with a V8, for 25K? Yes, the  interior has a lot of plastic, but what car does not nowadays?","Power. Manual trans. Surprisingly smooth and quiet ride, at least for this type of vehicle. Styling. I Have seen the 2010 offering. Although Ford has addressed the shortcomings noted in other reviews on the new model, I personally like the 2005-2009 model better. Shaker 500 audio system ROCKS!","Moot point. All addressed, or, in my opinion, over-addressed in the 2010 model. The Mustang was never intended to be a luxury car. It is a very well executed, affordable muscle car."

",I really love the font of the dash board gauges as it resembles that of the first Mustang's from the 60's,"Mileage! No doubt about it that this car needs to have better milage. For something with only 210 horsepower, there should be better mileage. Thankfully the 2011 Mustang V6 and GT are expected to both have 6 more highway mpg's"

4.875,Ford GT Convertible 2009,MattB ,12/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"An overall great car to drive and very, very fun.  Tons of power and very responsive steering. I also test drove a convertible BMW 330i which also was responsive and great to drive but the Mustang won out due to the lesser cost and greater power.  I have never owned a convertible but now I won't go back to a regular coupe.  I can't say enough good things about this car.","Handling, power, manual shift. I have the top down as often as possible since I live in California it is nearly every day even now in December!  Shaker stereo with Satellite radio and auxiliary input for phone and Ipod is also great!",None.  Gas mileage is not an issue if you but this car.

Mustang has always been in my blood and I've been wanting this car since it debuted in 2005. The 2009 has a cool 45th badge and mine comes with the GT appearance package. I love the retro style more than new 2010. So proud of this car. Amazing fun to drive. ADDICTIVE torque and super fast for the money.

Ford really gives you more car for the dollar minus less hp, and the fact it has no independent rear suspension like its compettitor. Besides a slight sluggish response in overdrive i find myself only hitting the gas so often and the car smoothly driving itself. The performance is smile worthy and is far better than previous mustang 6 cyls but nothing too extreme, the car thrives on the highway, country roads and dry conditions, kinda fears backroads, rain, and snow","head turning looks and nice styling, unmatched turning radius, shaker 500 watt system with sirius radio, better performance than previous 6 cyl generations, ambient lighting is great being able to pick the color of my gauge with my mood, black and white are the only way to go other colors look cheap","more hp for base model, although in 2011 they shall be stock with more hp than camaro, trak lock aka posse traction which comes standard on all gt's, independent rear suspension, quicker response on automatic transmission, get rid of the 115mph governor kinda embarrassing on a mustang"

The V6 isn't as quick at takeoff, but its gas mileage and insurance benefits outweigh that for the financially strapped.  The car is very comfortable to ride in, and for a sports car feels very roomy in the cab.  The handling is exceptional and moves, dives and dodges quickly with a velvet touch.  For the price the '09 Mustang is hard to beat, its a lot of car for such a small price.","great Handling, decent MPG both city and HWY.  Comfortable to ride in, even over long distances.  Quiet sounding ride, very little road noise, but the acceleration can be felt and heard! ","The interior. This has been everyones complaint here, and they're right, but a lot of the cars made today have pretty plasticy cheap feels. I think Ford can do better, this isn't terrible, but noteworthy.

Absolutely beautiful to look out and the build quality was equal to anything we investigated.But to our shock and surprise, the car was comfortable quiet,  and performed beyond expectations.

The outside is awesome and the v6 engine is especially peppy being a 4.0. It is not great on gas, but I do average in the mid-20s on the highway. the interior is fairly cheezy. the glovebox is pretty small (my old Dodge neon had a larger and more functional glovebox) and the center console is also kind of impractical, but all around it is more of a sportcar than anything else, so it is nothing to really get picky over. also they used a lot more cheap plastic than i would of liked. all around, i would purchase it again, and love it tho","shaker 500 audio system, peppy 4.0 v6 engine, 45 anniversary side badges, interior ambient color changing lighting","ford skimped out on the interior quality so much. for a nicer car they sure did load up on the cheap plastic on the dash. i have the upgraded ""alumnium"" trim, which seems to be shiny plastic and not metal. also there is plenty of room for the center console and glovebox, why are they so tiny?"

Poor build quality (several of mis-fitted/mis-aligned body panels, convertible top issues, windows are aligned differently, when compared to each other, etc.). Long-term reliability unknown, but build quality leaves something to be desired.  Price likely reflects use of cheap parts, which could call into question long-term durability.

Exterior is beautiful to my eye. Interior is also sharp, but Ford saves money on materials, lots of plastic. Leather buckets quite comfortable, but could use more side bolstering. No squeaks or rattles so far. Hard to beat for the money. A lot of car for 23k.  ",Exterior/interior styling. AC vents. Retro gauges. My Color display. Seats. Fuel economy/performance ratio. 45th anniversary badge. Short drop glass. Availability of aftermarket performance and appearance mods. ABS/traction control. Sat radio. Side airbags. Price.,Adjustable height for seatbelt. Rear seat delete option. Rear seats useless except for small children. Instant MPG display. Better interior materials and switchgear. Wet traction of stock Pirellis. Fun factor mean too many miles on it already!
