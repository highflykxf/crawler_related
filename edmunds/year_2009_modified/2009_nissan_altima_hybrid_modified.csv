I've had no problems with it and love the comfort (I'm a bigger guy), the acceleration is great, good mileage (28-32 depending on the time of year and it has a really comfortable ride.

Excellent climate system.
Keyless ignition is nice (though with NAH it is possible to walk away from an operational vehicle and not realize it is running).
Comfortable seats.
Good steering feel, but not as crisp as European cars.
Base model is very well equipped.
Excellent suite of safety features, including stability control, ABS, etc.
10 year warranty on entire hybrid system (Toyota technology).","This is primarily an Altima S with a Toyota hybrid system tacked on, rather than a hybrid built from the ground up.
I would have preferred more MPG and less performance -- don't need 0-60 in 7.8 secs.
Stock sound system is OK, not stellar.
Small trunk due to battery system.
A small refrigerant leak in the A/C system has been the only major problem.
TPMS sensors are a pain.
Back seat roof low for anyone over 6'.
Relatively low production -- worries that it may become difficult to service."

And the gas mileage is getting better. Just got back from a trip which is optimal for maximizing gas mileage, averaging 55 MPH, got 44.5 MPG on 108 mile trip! The NAV is good, but not great.

One year of abuse by multiple drivers doesn't seem to have caused any damage. It still glides effortlessly until I step on it, and then it ""moos"" forward (it doesn't ""roar"" exactly) like it's got a rocket on its rear.

We have been averaging around 33.8 mpg, which is a bit below par, but much better than the previous cars we have driven. Acceleration and pickup is sporty for a hybrid and the ride is very smooth. The mpg does take a hit in the winter when the heater is turned on, but with careful driving it can be offset. Nissan always provides solid and reliable vehicles and this one is no different. The navigation is a gem and has helped us get too many destinations. The leather seats are very comfortable and the bluetooth has been flawless as well. Initially it is hard to adjust to the smart key but you get used too it after a while.","Turn signals on mirror, smart key and push button start, navigation system, bluetooth, leather seats, gauge cluster, trip computer, 6 disc changer.

I have a mixed highway/city street commute and am much less stressed knowing that I am in EV Mode when in heavy traffic.  People are still amazed that a hybrid does not have to be a Prius - even Prius drivers.  The car does well on long trips as well.  My only problem after 2 years is the Aux Input on the stereo has stopped working.  Love the power seats, stereo, and large buttons.  Plenty of storage reachable by the driver!  My long legged teens say the back seat is comfortable too on long drives.  The swing from summer MPG to winter MPG is dramatic (I turn the heat off a lot - it has more impact than the AC in summer).","Fuel Economy, stereo with BIG buttons",Use leather or vinyl for armrests and door handles in non-leather models.

It drives beautifully, with power when you need it, and little road noise, lots of comfort and great handling. I marvel at the technology that has gone into this car. Truly remarkable. I highly recommend this car to anyone considering a hybrid. At least give it a test drive!

I also think it is remarkably fun to drive  - far more sporty  and quick than my wife's non-hybrid 4-cyl Accord.  Also runs in whisper quiet EV mode up to around 25-30mph - which is lots of fun on twisty rural backroads.

4.5,1st month review - 09 Altima Hybrid (NAH,Golf4 ,06/22/2009,,,5,4,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"Bought new 09 NAH. Plan is to keep the car for roughly 8 years so chose the best value considering cost over that time frame (gas, maintenance, tax credit, rebates/incentives, invoice). Toyota Camry-H (TCH) and NAH were top contenders. $2350 tax credit pushed NAH ahead and Nissan was aggressive in rebates - chose NAH (fully loaded).  Engine shifts to gas very quickly during acceleration. The car doesn't go to hybrid mode quickly when the engine is cold even on a hot sunny day after work.

Car rides smoothly and is quiet. Mileage is great for a car of this size if you're easy on the pedal. Consistently get 33 - 36 mpg all around. Extremely disappointed with the Technology Package. Definitely not worth it. The Nav system often suggests longer and less direct routes. Our little $150 Garmin does a much better job. The built-in Blue Tooth is virtually useless for dialing out calls. My little $30 ear piece does a better job. Sound system is great. The fiber-glass bumpers are cheaply made and easily damaged. I backed into a curb at less than 3 mph and cracked the rear bumper.,Good gas mileage around town. Comfortable and quiet ride. Great styling.,Tech package - fix it or dump it.

Personally the style of the available brands next to the Altima was no comparison, with the Altime clearly the winner in style, speed, great gas mileage, price, space and features.  Altima appearance to me is far superior inside and out.  I moved from a Camry due to a total loss accident to the Altima Hybrid for all of the reasons I just mentioned and the superior crash ratings the Altima has.

The NAH is rated one of the five top-rated cars for fuel efficiency and emissions at the EPA web site.  After driving the car for a month, I believe I made the right decision. It doesn't feel as ""floaty"" as some of the more luxury cars that I test drove, but has much more power and better handling than the other hybrids I drove. While it doesn't get as good mileage as the Prius or Honda Civic Hybrid, it's much more enjoyable and comfortable to drive.    ",Good mileage and emissions. Bose stereo sounds great. Keyless entry.
