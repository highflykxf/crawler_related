5,Great Car - Bought Used,silver7577@aol.com ,11/20/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,Didn't know much about a hybrid before but now have a great respect for them.

4,"Magnificent, but Dreadfully Boring",Bob Sandon ,07/30/2015,5,4,4,,,5,5,3,4,,,"I have put approximately 143,000 miles on this car.  I bought it new.  Oil changes with premium synthetic every 25,000 miles; otherwise, no service (except changing out tires). I've only had to replace the electric-system battery (pay someone to do this; it's a nightmare on your own). Pros: Reliability, obviously.  There is also more storage space than many people realize, especially with the seats down.  Two shepherds fit comfortably in the trunk; I've made several moves with this car.  The mileage has been good, especially with Ecotopia tires.  I live in Minnesota; I averaged around ~53 mpg during the summer with them.  I have Toyos right now; year round mileage with them has been ~43 mpg, mostly highway driving.  The car is comfortable and quiet at lower speeds.  I like the sound system and have found the GPS adequate.  The keyless entry is surprisingly nice; I wish it had remote start.Cons:  While the car while tolerate higher speeds (65 mph +), it's obviously unenthusiastic.  The mileage dips fairly dramatically in the winter, or with inefficient tires.  For that matter, snow tires are well-nigh essential in Minnesota with this car.  All-season will not hack it, especially in rural areas.  Mostly, though, this car is boring.  Really boring.  Eye-wateringly so.  A fantastic daily commuter, but - if you can only have one car in your stable - I'd have to recommend something else.",,

Started off around 47mpg and still around 44mpg even after 200K miles added to the odo.  I am 6ft.  Interior cabin was a little small for me but other capacities made up for lack of comfort.

I have alwasy be skeptical about buying a hybrid but one day I was so fed up with the vehicle I owned, I went straight to Toyota and traded it in for a 2008 Toyota Prius. Two years later, it is still the best automotive decision I have ever made. Although it does have some road noise, the ride is amazing and smooth.

What this car lacks is what the latest certain Prius models have improved upon.There is no power driver seat, so finding that sweet spot for driving is a real challenge. For example, you will be finding yourself reaching out for that steering wheel when you are in a comfortable position.That will put strain on your arms while driving.There is no lower back support, so for long drives that can be for hours, this is a lower back killer.Make sure you do your daily stretches to overcome the physical drawbacks of sitting in this car.","The mileage is the best feature...I get 50.1 mpg, provided I service my car every 3000 miles.

2.625,How do I hate thee?  Let me count the ways...,rhodeislandred ,06/02/2012,,,2,4,3,4,,3,2,2,1,"For transparency purposes, I must disclose that I grossly underestimated my love for the 'driving experience', and that I live in New England.1. Cold weather made gas bladder (tank) shring from 12 gallons to 9, resulting in more frequent stops at the gas stations.And no, it does not 'expand' when the weather warmed up.Did I mention the wildly inaccurate fuel gauge?2. Zero lumbar support makes it uncomfortable for those long drives you'll be taking since the mileage is so great.3. Speaking of great mileage, it's the best feature, as long as the weather is warm and the pavement dry.New England only meets that criteria 25% of the year.I averaged 30 mpgs. in the cold weather.","(Cont.)

4. The straw that broke the camels back was driving in 1 inch of slushy snow, and having the engine cut.
This is a 'safety' feature designed to protect the hybrid engine, but the result was sliding into a side walk with very little control over the vehicle.
You can amuse yourself with more stories like this by googling ""driving prius in the snow'.

My previous driving experience were with Mazda (to which I returned), and my ABS light only activated once.
This was a weekly occurrence with the Prius due to anything but drv pavement; it even happened when travelling over railroad tracks.

5. My car had a rear camera; still very difficult to see the rear view.","(Cont.)

6. Absolutely no pick up when trying to use the passing lane on the highway.

7. Factory tires may have contributed to poor driving experiences (see #4 above).

There may have been other things I hated, but I could be benefiting from repressed memory syndrome.
I would never recommend this car to anyone other than a little old lady that only drives in nice weather on local roads (or maybe to someone I really disliked!).
Hope this is helpful."

Other than the good gas mileage, everything else about the vehicle just ticks us off. Seats are lousy, can't see out the back, if something breaks it will cost you a fortune because the average do-it-yourself person can't even change the headlight bulb. If all you are interested in is getting from point A to point B with using as little fuel as possible, this is the car for you. If you plan on driving more than 10 miles or hauling anything, buy a mini-van. You won't get 45 mpg but you can get a nice one for 1/3 the cost of this Prius. 20K buys A LOT of gasoline and you can ride around in comfort with tons of space.

5,Value for Money Finally,Happy Prius Owner ,08/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We purchased our new Prius in Dec 08 and promptly drove from Florida to CA and back.  5900 miles with no problems and $125 in gas costs for the entire trip.  Since then we have put another 17000 miles on it with NO problems mechanical or otherwise.  I am looking forward to purchasing another in the not to distant future.  Excellent value for money.  Gas mileage after the first 6000 miles went from 47 highway and 49 city to 48 highway and 51 around town. Got to love the savings.

In the 3 months I've been driving it I average 62 mpg city/53 mpg highway/58 mpg combined (well above the combined 47 mpg EPA rating).  Comfort and styling are above average in my opinion.  Overall power is below average... but I didn't buy this car for the power.  Great commuter car as it has already saved me $200 in gas compared to my former vehicle (2005 Toyota 4runner). You can find alternate commuter cars at a better price but not with this much comfort/styling or getting this good of mileage!,1. EV mode allows you to drive gas free under 42 mph (using a feather foot on the GO pedal).  2. For a mid-size car... plenty of cargo room.  Seats fold down nicely to allow for larger cargo.  3. Interior designed well with plenty of instrumentation to allow for great mpg's!,1. Low rear roof causes limited rear view out back window (understood given the low drag of the car).  2.

I have owned SUVs as well as sports cars and sedans, but this is one of the easiest cars I've driven yet.  In town this Prius gets 53 MPG and for day to day commuting it handles well.  It is not a car that I enjoy driving fast, since at the limit of handling it is a little unsettled.  The turn radius is fantastic though, and it understeers predictably through tight fast corners.  The acceleration is similar to a mid 70s American sedan - it won't win any races.","Tight turn radius, a decent amount of interior space, great visibility, exceptional fuel economy, overall quietness, ride is very comfortable, fit and finish,  low cost.","Sun roof option, louder horn, better quality interior fabric, diesel engine, improved performance (it would be Nice to have a 0 - 60 mph in 8.5 seconds), improve the voice activated phone.  Improve seat support.  Less body roll in turns.  "

The Prius drives like an upscale mid-sized sedan. It's quiet, comfortable, handles well, and has gotten over 50 mpg in city and highway driving the first week of operation.  Fit and finish is outstanding. According to CR, reliability should be well above average. So far, I'm very satisfied with the car.

We measure very safe levels in all parts of the car - with only slight raise (several seconds) while breaking.  We found very unsafe levels in other hybrid cars we tried and that's why we got a Prius.  Toyota obviously has taken precautions to minimize a health risk - even one not generally talked about.

By the time I got back home that evening, I was in serious agony!  I can't believe Toyota put so much attention into the technology-bluetooth, reverse cameras, smart key, the entire hybrid system-and the seats were just a mere afterthought! No lumbar support?

I often coast for blocks when I anticipate a light changing ahead, accelerate slowly, but it seems to make little difference.  The car has been tested 3 times so far and the dealerships say it is fine.   Since the only reason for leasing this car as opposed to less expensive vehicles was for mileage, I am very disappointed.   While the car is quite comfortable and the interior functional, the stereo is of very poor quality.
