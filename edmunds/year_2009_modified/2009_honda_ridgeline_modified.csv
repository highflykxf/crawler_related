5,You will be happy with this truck.,deadeye ,07/30/2016,,4,5,,,5,,4,5,,,"OK, so the knock on the Ridgeline is that it is not really a pickup.  Well guess what.  It is to me.  It trucks, it carries, it hauls, it tows, it stores, well, for what I expected of this very smooth riding truck,  it met all.  The only reason I'm selling my 2009 Ridgeline is to purchase a 2017 Ridgeline.  Yes I have been happy and very pleased with this vehicle.",,
4,Better value for your dollar!,Rob Riegel ,10/25/2015,5,5,4,,,5,5,4,4,,,"I bought my 09 RT used from a very reputable dealer one year ago with 80 k miles. 20k miles later and no major issues. Every time I take it in for service my mechanic is amazed to see how clean it is inside where oil cap screws in. I use Mobil 1 full synthetic oil with proper oil filter. Engine runs strong and gets up to 23 mpg on the highway with a light load and not towing anything. I have not towed anything yet. Great handling on dirt roads and muddy roads and there was not a need to use 4wd feature. Acceleration and shifting is good. Climate control is good. Height and visibility is good. Stereo system sound is ok. Plenty of storage, which is really awesome. Interior fabric stains too easy from water. Love the sliding rear window. Love the extra storage in the cab and in truck bed, which beats the storage of a Toyota. There is ample passenger space. Love the way the rear seats fold up to load extra cargo. Transmission has a little clunk, but it's normal. It's from how I operate the accelerator pedal as trans picks up the slop. I can get about 380 miles per tank of gas. Full synthetic oil change every 5,000 miles and I service the fuel system with one can of sea foam at every oil change interval. Once a month I fill the gas tank with non ethanol gas. I'll be due for 4 wheel brake service soon and 4 new tires. I compared this truck to a certified Toyota Tacoma. Toyota has a nice reputation, but I got a better deal on this truck and it's got everything that I need at a fraction of the cost. Paint chips to easily, but that's where touch up paint comes in handy. Suspension, steering, brakes and any of the power options work great. No report on the 4wd yet, because I have not used it. Cruise control works great and the TPMS is accurate. I like the 5 ft bed. It's not to big and not to small. This is a very practical truck for the working man and I chose a 285.00 a month payment vs a 400.00 a month payment of the Toyota Tacoma certified(2 door single cab 4 cyl 2009). I'll expect 400k miles on this Honda motor. Once the motor is tired then I'll replace it, because this truck serves a better purpose for me than any other general truck. It's like a small military truck.lol. People keep trying to buy my truck and I tell them no.  The only thing that concerns me is the air bag recall. The part won't be available until later in the year.",,

Like the size, engine is decent (engine started to feel better at around 50k miles), tows fine (i'm towing just under the 5k lb. limit but not long distances). Here's my main beef..the wind noise is ungodly! Would buy again in an instant ifquieter inside. Honda, would it kill you to drop in $150 of sound insulation? Keep the fluids fresh as it affects gas mileage greatly (3-4 mpg). If this were quieter it's a 5 out of 5, but don't expect it to replace a full size truck, that's not a beef, just a reality. The Ridgeline was meant to fill a different niche which it does nicely, I just wish it did it with less interior noise.",,"Honda, put in some sound insulation!"

4.375,Love my Ridgeline,diesel ,07/30/2010,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,3,5,We decided to trade in our old SUV and get a pickup.  The only Truck I was really interested in was a Ridgeline.  Good news is I have not been disappointed in the four months since our vehicle purchase.  The Ridgeline definitely turns heads.  It is a very stylish truck with nifty features.  Driving is a pleasure as there is almost a car like feel when driven.  Overall a big time winner!,Very roomy.  Fits five full size adults with ease.  The fold up second seats are great.  Love the in bed trunk!  Stereo system is fine.  Handles off- roading just fine.,The bed of the trunk needs to be more scratch resistant.  Gas milage could be a little better.  Finally why not a third seat in the front?  There is plently of room for it.

I carry enough tools to fill it and I can keep a clean truck without loading and unloading daily.  The ride is great and it pulls my boat with ease.  I hope someone takes this concept and continues.

There are many small intelligent things: the heater doesn't blow cold air on you (it waits until the car has warmed up before blowing any air), the driver's window has auto-down AND auto-up, you can lower all four windows with the key fob (great for airing out hot air), and the car gives you your real-time mpg as you drive.

I couldn't be happier as this vehicle fulfills all my needs for a truck - adequate towing, people mover, great ride, good at the lumber yard/garden center - in a 4 wheel drive long lasting Honda package. For most of us that want a truck, don't tow more than 5000 lbs, and don't live on a farm, this truck was designed with us in mind.  ","In bed trunk, fold up seats, composite bed.",Improve fuel economy.  Currently averaging 16 in all city driving but I am driving like my grandmother to get it.
4.5,The car/truck,Scott Watson ,04/03/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"I would ignore the previous ""hondahater"" negative review; obviously he made a wrong decision to lease this vehicle. If this is the type of vehicle you are looking for (read; not huge trailer towing, 4x4ing,) then it is the right decision. I was looking at a Tacoma to replace my 15 year old Dakota, this Ridgeline is the ticket for me. ",A trunk in a truck; why didn't anybody think of this before? Sportscar like handling,Seat is built for a slim person; widebodys need not apply. Steering wheel needs tilt. That's it!
4.75,I love it!,Boy and his dog ,04/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I have had for a little over a month.  It is excellent and more people should consider it.  I compared Tundra, Tacoma, F-150 and Chevy.  Overall, best value by far! The trunk is awesome, ride is car like, it has more than sufficient off road (4x4) capability 99% of us.  Towing ability is respectable.  Interior features are a great blend of luxury, quirky, and utility truck. It is so easy and pleasant to drive this truck.  After 5 years of a Tacoma and a lousy Chevy 2500, I have finally stepped up into a truck built just for me. Gas mileage is okay- average about 18.5.  I can get over 21 on highway.  V-6 has plenty of power/torque. A great truck, high quality and I even like the looks.","In bed trunk, composite bed, ride, handling, design, build quality, no rattles, no leaks, built in Canada and Honda ISN'T USING MY TAX DOLLARS FOR A BAILOUT that I sure as heck don't get.","Steering wheel mounted shifter is a bit clunky, rubber floor mats are a little thin and cheap."
4.625,love my Ridgeline,Gerry ,03/26/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've had my Ridgeline now for over 3 months. I can't imagine a truck fitting my needs better.  I love the looks, not just another pick-up. The in bed lock-able compartment is an answer to so many problems for pick-up owners  Fun to drive, good mileage (19.5) mostly highway.  I wish I knew what they were thinking when they put in that center glove box. ODD!  Over all, I'd do it again in a second.",Lockable in bed trunk and unique look,That center glove box.  Something more simple. 
1.75,JUNK JUNK JUNK,Honda Hater ,03/14/2009,,,1,2,2,3,,1,2,1,2,"Why I purchased this car I will never know. Look Honda has great compact, coupes and sedans.....but trucks???? They should leave it up to others. MPG is 10 at best. Interior is all plastic, cheap looking and rattles. Sun roof seal leaks in water if only glass is closed. Can't wait to get rid of this piece of junk. Only good thing is the stereo system w/ nav. Only 20 more months to go on lease. Then I'm running for a Tundra (real truck). ",stereo,Stop lying about the mpg. Even going downhill in neutral it wont get more than 10-12 mpg. Also the car is sluggish and slow on hills.
4.875,Great Truck ,WRGADog ,03/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I sold my 2006 Ridgeline RTL. Prior to purchasing the 09 Ridgeline I drove each competitors vehicle, and decided to purchase a 2009 Ridgeline RTL w/navigation.  In the end, I couldn't part with the in-bed trunk, ride quality, general utility, and balance between car and truck offered by the Ridgeline.  The Ridgeline's price was also less than comparably equipped  4x4 vehicles from other mfgs. The Ridgeline's 4x4 capability is more limited, but it satisfies my needs.  So far, I love the truck (700 miles) and the gas mileage has been a respectable 18 mpg with most driving around town.  My truck is Billet Silver, w/chrome step bars, silver roof rack, bug deflector, splash guards, and wheel locks.","Ride quality, room, and overall balance between truck and SUV.","Power folding exterior mirrors, dual exhaust, and addition of a more powerful V6 or V8 engine"
