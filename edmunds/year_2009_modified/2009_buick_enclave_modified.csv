1,"Engine failure with less than 50,000 miles",David Romer ,11/10/2016,2,2,3,,,1,3,1,3,,,"I became aware of a transmission issue with this make/model of vehicle after purchasing the vehicle from my Wife's grandmother (first owner).  The transmission felt like it was slipping and the service engine light came on so I attempted to drive the vehicle into the dealership, but ended up requiring a tow when the vehicle broke down on the freeway.  The dealership found a  broken rocker arm, opened the engine and determined that the engine required complete replacement (vehicle under 50,000 miles).  I was told by the dealership that they could not identify the cause of the issue.  GM offered to cover less than half of the cost to replace the engine (My bill will be $5,500). Once the engine is replaced the dealership will have to inspect the transmission and possibly replace the wave plate.  My plan is to repair the vehicle, sale it, and never again drive a GM vehicle.",,

1,Beautiful / Horrible,Herb Walstreet ,12/01/2015,,1,4,,,1,3,4,3,,,"This car is cursed.  We had a Yukon XL for 10 years and never had any issues.  We have 80k miles or so on this vehicle and have spent around $10k in various maintenance and repairs.  We've had to replace the transmission 11 months ago and it's currently in the shop because of a stutter it has in cruise on the highway (ignition coils?).  We know our power steering is going out but it's not bad enough that Buick will replace it under the extended warranty.  Our heated seats only stay on for about 5 mins then go off.  The instrumentation buttons (AC temp control) have worn incredibly fast (replaced them once already), have had a ""stuck strut"", replaced rotors, replaced the battery and some decorative adhesive molding on the window frames is bubbling up and shredding (looks horrible when you look at the driver's side of the car).  All of this and our gas mileage is terrible also (13 in the city and 18 highway).  I want to like this car - it's really good looking but we've got to get rid of it and we'll avoid Buick.  My recommendation, steer clear!",,

1,WORST CAR I'VE EVER OWNED,Lindsey ,09/16/2015,1,5,5,,,1,1,1,5,,,"I bought my car in Feb. 2014 with 28k miles on it... A month later the steering wheel started making a whining noise. I took it to the dealership and they said ""that is common with those SUV's"" and this was when the recall on the power steering came out. So I said ok, what if I'm driving down the road and my power steering goes out? They said ""then we will fix it."" That's safe! Fix the problem AFTER something bad happens... And shortly after this I had to replace the water pump (@ $385- which was the 2nd time it had been replaced and my car still had less than 40k miles!) Then, on my way to work one day a few months later my car made a terrible noise so I pulled over... The timing chains broke (that's great for the transmission)... So I had those replaced under special policy. A few months after that... my car was running TERRIBLY. The transmission was slipping. I took it to another dealership and they fixed the 3-5-R plate under special policy but then I needed my A/C fixed as well as a coil and spark plug replaced. I ended up paying over $475 this time.  A month or so later... 2 more coils and spark plugs needed replaced as well as the front engine mount. I was quoted over $1100 and my car has 62k miles on it currently!! I got the car back after the repairs and the 2nd time I drove it it is saying ""LOW OIL PRESSURE. STOP ENGINE!"" So I give up. I am trading it. I don't feel comfortable selling it to someone individually! I am SICK that I have to trade because I was planning on driving this for a very long time! I have 2 children and they LOVE the DVD player. I love the back up camera and we couldn't ask for anything prettier or better on the inside! When you have a car that you're going to lose over $10k on it really makes you disgusted with the company! I have contacted GM and they say ""I will note your issues"" .... It's like oh thanks. I'm glad you're taking the time to do that.. how about reimbursing me for all the money I've spent in repairs, tows, missed time from work because my car wouldn't start, etc. etc.??? I will NEVER buy another GM car! Worst company ever.",,
3,Cylinders,sdj ,08/27/2015,3,3,3,,,2,4,2,4,,,"Bought my car with 4000 miles in 2010.  A year after I bought it it started kicking back when on cruise and going uphill.  Took it in to dealership.  They said they replaced this and that but every year after that I kept taking it back for the same problem of kicking back when going uphill.  As soon as the warranty ran out I had to take it in again and this time ended up paying over $700 to fix two of the cylinders.  Have tried cleaning out carbon.  It is even worse now than it ever was.  Can't drive it with cruise on because it has started kicking back even on straight flat roads.  Check engine light constantly comes on and we have spent close to $1500 just trying to get things looked at to try and figure out the problem.  Have called GM to try and have them reimburse my dollars and stand behind their product but they won't.  For such a huge company, it's too bad that they treat their customers this way.  I'm disgusted and now looking to get rid of it with 76K miles.  I do not recommend purchasing this vehicle to anyone.  I won't even try to sell it outright because I wouldn't feel right selling it to another innocent individual.",,

I have loved and sang praises of my new car! I traded my 2009 Yukon XL for this car to save on gas and loved the downsize and savings. Since I purchased my Yukon brand new and never had issues, I opted out of the extended warranty on this car thinking I wouldn't have issues either. Boy was I wrong! Within a month one of the coil packs went out but it was replaced at no charge under dealership 30 day warranty. Six months later I started having transmission problems and my transmission needed to be replaced. Within two weeks of it being replaced started having other trouble and had to replace the throttle body. Since then I have had to replace every coil pack, the timing chain and everytime I get it fixed months later there are more problems.",,
3.5,Love the Enclave but hate my car,kreshe ,11/05/2014,,,5,5,1,1,,3,5,4,4,"I wish these reviews were posted before I purchased mine in 2011. After buying the car, I had issues with the engine light (gas tank cap leaked), water pump, air not blowing cold (dealer still unable to locate the problem), I just had my transmission rebuilt (two shops said they have seen this with this vehicle, Traverse and Acadia) and a day after shelling out over $3K, my engine light comes on (possible catalytic converter)!!!  I am tired of the problems but after spending all of this money, I cannot afford another vehicle. I seriously wish General Motors would look into all of these issues!","When it works, it drives well and I really love the car. I also love the features and the way the car is designed.

3.375,No Longer Own Ours... Buyer Beware!!!,sfreid1 ,03/16/2014,,,4,4,2,2,,4,4,4,3,"When the Enclave is working properly, it is an excellent car. Quiet, comfortable, and fairly powerful for an SUV. However, there was rarely a time where everything was in proper working order. Our first major issue was the entire throttle body going out, which also caused the entire electrical system to crash, leaving us stranded on the side of a busy road, partially blocking traffic. This experience also gave us a chance to try out Onstar, which was worthless. The hazards also drained the battery after one hour, so they didn't work. After that, buttons snapped off, brakes needed replacement, transmission, and power steering prob.

In straight city driving under the most conservative starts and stops my Enclave gets an averave of 11.7 MPG.  I have provided the dealership the gas receipts and milage.  The fact is that the 6 speed electrocic transmission holds the car in 2nd gear at 30 miles an hour causing the engine to Tach at a steady 1900 RPM. When the car passes 40 MPH the Tach drops to 1200 RPM. I was contacted by GM's Division Manager who told me that is how the transmission is calibrated and there is nothing they can do about it.

My problem is either the seat is too short or the seat height is not right for me, I get a cramping sensation in my right thigh, especially after driving for awhile.  Second concern is that the middle position of the 8 seater will not easily accommodate a child seat as we hoped.  Should have tested that.  Overall a great vehicle and fun to drive.","Power seat, satellite radio, stylish appearance","Thigh support seating, Driver seat can smash items or people in back when I press button to exit from driver seat"
4.75,Loving it so far,LI Driver ,09/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"After 4 minivans, I had to have a vehicle that offered more comfort and style, but still offered a roomy third row for my teen/tween-aged kids.  But I did not want anything as big (and costly) as a Sequoia.  The Enclave fits the bill perfectly.   It is roomy and comfortable to ride in.  So far, performance has been great.  I read the criticism about the transmission being slow to downshift, but I haven't noticed anything significant.  MPG was another concern, but on a recent trip, I got over 21 mpg (obviously highway).  For a vehicle this size, I can't complain.  If you are looking for a crossover that combines lots of room with style and comfort, check out the Enclave.",Very comfortable seating.  Overall style.  OnStar/XM (free trials for both included).,"Layout of switches/controls could be more intuitive.  For example: only one lever off the steering column, which includes windshield wiper controls (among other things), while the rear wiper controls are found under the radio.  No biggie, but counter intuitive."
5,What Kind of Car Is It?,Amazed!!! ,08/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I don't think I have ever owned a car people were so inquisitive about.  We drove the Enclave on a whim (actually to kill time while we waited on the salesman to find a Yukon on the lot).  Wow! What a suprize!  Our past 3 vehicles have been a Yukon and 2 Tahoes.  We actually had decided on another Yukon but we were not happy with the ride or the boxy look of the new body style.  We drove the Lexus, Infiniti, Tahoe, Yukon and kept coming back to the Buick. I researched and read over 70 reviews. They basically said the same thing. It's a great car!  We have 12K wonderful, enjoyable miles and it has been a pleasure every time I have opened the door.  I still can't believe I am driving a Buick.",Someone really did aa great job on all of the storage pockets.  The 110 outlet is great for charging computer or phone (my daughter though she was going to be able to blow dry her hair...haha).  I love the flat folding 3rd row seats. Easy! Lot's of room. Where has electric start been all of my life?,I haven't quite figured out the front garment hook.  It's a little strange.  
4.875,Base Enclave CXL,alvanhill ,08/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Finally a salesperson listened and found a base vehicle for me to buy. The Enclave CXL FWD compares favorably with our 08 Lexus ES in comfort and quiet ride and has all the equipment I wanted without $$$'s in options. The six speed tranny takes some getting used to and I wish the drivers seat cushion gave more thigh support but this is a very nice vehicle for the money. More mpg would be nice but I think the DI engine will regulate that. At 7,000 miles the car delivers 24 mpg on the highway @ 70 mph.","On-Star, Satellite radio, power tailgate.",Get rid of the support for the left foot on the drivers side for more leg room. Longer drivers seat cushion for thigh support.
4.875,Sweet!,Bryan Wagstaff ,08/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I owned a Jaguar Vanden Plas and Chevy Astro and wanted a vehicle that combined the best of both. I found it in the Enclave. I now have the luxury of the Jag and the cargo/towing capabilities of the Astro. I also need an AWD/4WD vehicle to get me to my mountain cabin in the winter. The Enclave thus far has proven to be a sturdy, well built, fun to drive vehicle. There is so much about it that I like it's hard to know where to begin. However, of all the reviews I have read no one has mentioned the remarkable turning radius of the vehicle.","Interior & exterior styling, remote engine start, back up camera with proximity sensors, passenger & cargo space, Onstar, and the hands free Bluetooth phone features.",Real wood and less plastic.

Coming from many Japanese SUV's (Toyotas and Nissans) we had boiled it down to a Lexus RX350, Audi Q5, and the Acura MDX, when we passed an Enclave on the road one day and my wife said... what was that. We were at the Buick dealership 30 minutes later, and after a test drive my wife fell in love. It doesn't even sound right when I say we bought a Buick, but this is no Buick of yesteryear.

We bought it new at 77 mi. and now have over 5K.  I traded in my BMW 750il 2000 to go SUV because of the extra seats & AWD for ski season & long distance trips.  The only reason I scored lower on performance is because I previously owned a sports car. :)  The other gripe is the fuel mileage.  It's been averaging about 21 mi. per gallon. I drive approximately 800 mi. per week. Otherwise, we love our new car!

3.625,Looks good but a few issues,Hollis Stavn ,07/26/2009,,,4,5,5,3,,4,3,2,3,The angle of the headrest tilts too far forward forcing my neck to not be able to be straight when driving. This is a design problem with this car. Another issue is that the cover for the sun roof is a screen only which lets some heat through so even with the sunroof closed you can feel the heat coming through on your head and also heating up the car. I have the basic sound package which is anemic in volume output. There is only one power outlet on the front console. There is a compartment on the dash which looks like it is a place to put glasses but being under the windshield will likely melt them in the heat. I traded a Rendezvous for this and the Rendezvous was actually a sportier drive.,Articulating headlights are very cool on winding roads. This is a sharp looking car both inside and out. Lots of room. Back up camera and sonar is great. Bluetooth to phone is great.,Fix the incorrect headrest. Add an additional power outlet- you could not use an ipod and charge a phone or an external nav system with only one outlet.

I can't believe how great this car is.  It drives around town like a dream.  I don't think you will need the running board step assist.  We have kids and my 5' 3"" wife doesn't have any problems getting in and out.  This is really well built.  The Lexus had some cool - gee whiz features that the Lexus doesn't, but overall I think this Buick better.  Good job GM!!  ","Smart Slide seats.

Features, past experience (I had two Buicks I drove as Federal law enforcement officer averaging 70K per year without any problems)price and 0% financing, it was a no brainer.  I also did some checking on the dealer and found another Enclave owner near where I live and he had very good experience with the dealer.  I have had the car now two months and still think I made the right choice.  The only thing I could think of to improve would be the mileage, although it comes close to the EPA standard. As of today (June 23rd) I have a little over 2000 miles without any problems. ","On Star (it realy is amazing what it can do) XM radio, Navigation, seating comfort, and storage room.",I know that Buick is working on a heads-up display for the Nav.  That would be a great improvement for safety.  Perhaps also a laser cruise control similar to the RX350 would also be another safety item.

We test drove so many new cars recently, and saw this car on lot and asked about it.  I was cautious because of the name Buick reminded me of my Dad's car.  Once we got in the car, I was shocked how nice everything was. The test drive was amazing!    ",Love the Interior-Seating is perfect! No Road Noise! Better than our Lexus! I love the mirrors that retract. Trunk space is great once you put the 3rd row seats down. Automatic start is nice! You could sleep in this car! Dual Sunroofs are nice!

I was hesitant to even consider it because I wanted the RX350 but my wife heard that this Buick was worth considering.  I hate to admit I am ever wrong but the Enclave is by far the better vehicle than the Lexus in every way after test driving both twice (I was really trying to convince myself that the Buick was worse the first time).  It gets good fuel economy, has great luxury features I want, safety features have no equal, and is made by the most dependable brand this year!  I never thought I would go back to an American car but if they continue to make vehicles like this, I will never leave! Kudos to Buick!  BTW...I am 35 in a Buick!?!","The ride quality and the comments I get from everyone who sees my Enclave...Onstar (lifesaver), Fuel economy, DVD headrests, Very happy with the entire vehicle!","Fuel economy is good for this size vehicle (3rows) but maybe a hybrid would make it insane....think RX400 killer...this vehicle suprisingly killed the RX350's image in my mind, so why not have Buick kills it's Hybrid brother...."
5,Very happy,Impressed ,05/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I saw the Enclave about a year ago and started my research immediately.  Compared to all the other sport looking crossovers, with a three pass third row seat, the Buick has the most standard features at a better or comparable price point.  I had a Tahoe, and I loved it, except for the cargo behind the third row, I couldn't even fit a standard stroller back there, so this time I was looking for the passenger room and functionality, and I found it.  My kids can easily access the third row.  It has all the pretty things that I wanted, to include the dual sun roofs and power liftgate.  It looks hot, drives like a dream, and made all my friends jealous!  And, you can't beat the warranty!  Thanks!","Power liftgate, fold flat third row, easy glide access to third row, passenger comfort in all rows, dual sun roofs, sweet turning radius, AWD, turning xenon headlights, I have the cloth interior and it's very nice, inside is cavernous without looking like it from the outside.",The grill is kind of cheesy.  I don't like how it's connected to the hood at the major lift point.  I'm concerned someone who doesn't know might lift too quick and snap it off.
4.375,Never though I would drive a Buick,mark ,05/24/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4," We narrowed our choice down to the Audi Q7, Acura MDX and finally bought an 2009 Enclave CXL AWD (Carbon Black).  We truly love the car.  Very roomy.  Great design. Super quiet. Handling very good for an SUV. The third row comfortable for three.  We are a family of four. GM did a good job on this car.  This is an excellent SUV Crossover that should be striving to be the best in every category, it has that kind of potential.  There is need for some tweaking, such as real wood, better MPG and throttle response/shift adjustment.  I would highly suggest the Enclave to anyone looking for a solid, well designed SUV. ",Excellent Design.  Paint finish outstanding.  Very roomy.  Technology and entertainment all easy to use and function very well too. ,"Real Wood. a slight upgrade on plastics.

5,A Pleasant Drive,Better Buy Buick ,05/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We ordered our Enclave as we did not want a lot of the options on cars the dealer had on his lot.  We have been extremely well pleased for the most part.  We travel with our dog and there is room for the crate plus luggage.  Last fall we traveled from Michigan to Boston and got 31-33 mpg on the New York Thruway traveling at the 65 mph speed limit.  Coming home on both the Thruway  and side trips we averaged 28 mph. Don't know what we get around town.  We liked the styling inside and out which is what attracted us to the car after doing much research.  Two of our neighbors were so impressed with the car they bought one themselves.  One of them traded in a newer Lincoln cross over.,We love most everything including Onstar.  Have too as we keep our cars on average 10 years. I accepted the dealer's offer to take a tour of the factory and was mightily impressed with the way the cars are built and the technology that goes into not only the product but the production system., Occasional transmission hesitation. Did have a problem with the automatic rear hatch not working properly after several months ownership.  Took several weeks for the part to come in. The sun visors could be sturdier.

With city driving mixed in we are seeing an overall average of 19mpg, so we are very satisfied with the fuel economy.

Fit and finish is very nice for an American car maker.,"Heated and cool seats, plus the bluetooth and backup camera.","More leather instead of hard plastic, use more real leather seating and real wood trim."
5,The Buick Enclave is Fantastic!,Enclave Fan ,12/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought my 09 Buick Enclave a few months ago and I am very pleased. The styling is gorgeous, the build quality is tight and sharp, and the ride is very comfortable even for a big guy like me. I tried the Acura MDX which is so overrated, the Lexus 330 is another wildly overrated SUV, the Audi, BMW, and Mercedes' comparable SUVs cost 25-30K more and aren't any better. The Buick Enclave has great interior space, just hauled a Christmas tree and wreath to the house with room to spare, and the mileage has been averaging 17mpg with AWD! The engine is strongly reactive and the steering is tight and responsive. The interior noise is practically zero! I've owned a lot of vehicles and this Buick rocks!","Quiet and spacious interior, excellent build quality, elegantly beautiful exterior, sweet handling for a good sized SUV, and good mileage for an AWD.","Standard luxury wood dash kit, sunroof screen could be more ""blend-in"" and substantial, otherwise this SUV is perfect! "
3.875,Oh Boy,Mike` ,12/05/2008,,,5,5,1,2,,5,5,4,4,"The ride was incredible the comfort was out of this world. Then the engine light came on. Engineer flies in from GM, to find what he feels is a clearance problem with the head. We had the car for almost two weeks and has been at the shop for almost two and half weeks.  He is not even sure a new head will fix the problem. I hope GM stands behind their product. 1,500 miles on vehicle",Interior and the accessories are great. Cannot wait to take on vacation.,Adjustable captain chairs in the rear of vehicle.
4.5,Pleasantly surprised,Scott ,10/30/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,It has been a long time since we owned a GM car and I have to say that this one is much improved over years ago. The Enclave is very well made and quiet.  We get a lot of positive comments on its appearance. We have young teens and just traded in the minivan. Most of our disappointments are related to the fact that this vehicle doesn't have as much room as a minivan and is missing some of the interior accessories you would find in a van.,"OnStar is awesome, heated and cooled seats, looks, fit and finish, articulating HID headlights, ","More storage, passenger side mirror is only one that is not auto-dimming, more comfortable headrests, so far, mileage is lower than sticker"
5,Great Vehicle,Happy Customer ,10/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This vehicle replaced a van that we really liked. However it is a huge step up. This is the nicest new vehicle I have ever purchased. This a gem that people need to look at. With the direct injection and variable valve timing, I get better fuel mileage than my van. It is well thought out and we enjoy all of the features it has to offer. It is comfortable and super quiet & smooth down the road. I would recommend this vehicle to anybody. My family loves it. Take one for a test drive. ","OnStar, XM radio, dual sunroof, power liftgate, DVD-kids favorite",I still miss heads up display. I hoped that would be an option but it wasn't.
4,A vacation vehicle that works,clm ,10/16/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,Bought it to travel in have not been disapointed. Quiet ride deceiving in will suprise you when running 85 doesn't seem like it. Handles mountain roads well v-6 and 6 speed work well together. Interior comfortable but son thinks door decor cheesey would like wood grain to emulate steering wheel better.,Shifting is favorite for son likes manual shifting. The quiet is mom and dads along with sky views. Also the brakes work. Had to shut down hard in mountains 75 to 0 almost smoked the tires but they got us there. The Michelin tires run quiet. Also nice match up.,Transmission feels loose like loose clutch sometimes in down or up shifting there is a lag (loose feeling) feels scarrey sometimes not sure where your at.
4.5,Glad I waited for an '09,FB3 ,10/02/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"Performance: Much better than last years anemic engine, but still doesn't have the nice low end torque of a V8. Glad I waited for an '09. Comfort: Front headrest not tilt adjustable. I think this was a new safety law. Second row seats quite small and minimum leg room. Fuel economy: So far very good for a vehicle of this size. Interior design: Nice except for the cheap semi-see through sun roof interior shades and small cramped second row seats. Build quality: Very good. As good as my 2008 Infinity M35. Very tight. Reliability: Too soon to know, but I have had excellent experiences with GM vehicles over the years and don't expect anything bad from this one.  ",Extremely quiet and attractrive interior. Nicely appointed. Many nice convenience features. Very good ride and driveability.  The turning radius is much better than I expected from a large front wheel drive vehicle.,Use higher quality light blocking interior sun roof shades that match the headliner. The ones installed are really unacceptable.  For what it is I feel that it is a great if not perfect substitute for my Tahoe. 
5,Great ride,Doug ,09/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Took this on a 5500 mile trip this summer and was very happy.. good mileage and a super ride. Drove 75 (was on a lots of freeways) and got 23 miles a gallon..XM radio was really great as I am a first time user. I have 12,000 miles and it's running super. Took a little getting used to the six speed transmission in town but now I am used to it..","Ride, visibility.",Need more and cup holders.
5,High Quality Vehicle,MN Driver ,09/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We compared the Enclave to the Audi Q7 and replaced a Yukon XL. My wife wanted something smaller, but that still has a third row. We initially were focused on the Acadia, but kept looking at the Enclave in the showroom and appreciated the chrome wheels and more refined interior. My wife preferred the Enclave versus the Q7 and we saved 13K as well.",Third row seat. Gas mileage for this size vehicle. In head rest DVD/LCD screens. Overall fit and finish. Value ,"Bluetooth microphone sound quality. Wood trim instead of faux wood trim. Latch cover should be removable on back of second row seats. Option packaging a challenge. We wanted the in seat DVD, but would have had to pay for the overhead DVD to get the Bose sound system."
5,A Huge Step Up,tyler ,09/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We traded in from a Toyota Seqouia and we are very happy. It rides like nothing youve ever been in. The interior is amazing and very well built. The gas mileage is best in class and it's gorgeous outside and in. A may be a bit slow, but it is very swift compared to all other SUVs I've driven, to which it should be compared. The warranty is unbeatable and new GM are supposed to be very reliable from what ive heard and read about in auto magazines. It's extremely quiet too.","Styling, liquid smooth ride, very quiet, great gas mileage for something its size, top notch materials in interior along with excelent fit and finish, and moving headlamps.",The optional skylight could extend to the back row.
