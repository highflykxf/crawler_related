3,Toyota Quality Declines As They Refuse To Accnowle,James Haggerty ,12/20/2015,3,3,4,,,5,4,4,4,,,"I own a 2009 Toyota Tacoma Sport. This is their top model with the most expensive tag yet the aluminum coating is peeling off the base metal on the rims.I contacted customer service and was told to take it to a dealership for inspection. The conclusion, (or should I say collusion as they appear to know what the answer was going to be from corporate headquarters) , was that the bubbling and peeling was due to exposure to the elements. Toyota says it's normal usageissues and not their problem because the 3/36,000 warranty is over. All I could do is apologize for not having the forethought to bring them in at night. Bottomline is don't buy a Toyota with aluminum rims or better yet don't trust Toyota until they start acting like the company they once were.",,

Reliability was never an issue. My Tacoma never failed to start and never left me stranded. The 2.7 four is a great engine. I averaged about 20 mpg with it.My dissatisfaction was the result of the trucks build quality. I had constant rattling coming from the drive shaft going over bumps when the drivetrain was unloaded. The dealership replaced the driveshaft. The problem remained. Toyota said it was a known issue with the 4x4 manual regular cab. I would have to live with it. I chose not to.","Great engine, decent gas mileage. Nice size and good looking.

Very reliable.","They could not have built this truck any cheaper. How much would it have cost Toyota to equip this base Tacoma with intermittent wipers?

Numerous squeaks and rattles in the dash and headliner have become extremely annoying.

I traded a 95 Suzuki sidekick with 150,000 miles and was a better made vehicle than this thing. My truck has 10,400 miles and already has signs of rust on wheels and frame. Dealer and Toyota agree it is from road abrasion and won't cover problem. I have a 2002 Ford Taurus with 50,000 miles and has no signs of rust. A blind man could see that the wheels has very little of the paint on them. The price of the truck should have more accessories.

4.125,Less than expected,Pride and such... ,10/09/2010,,,5,5,4,4,,4,3,5,3,"Decent quality truck but I expected more from Toyota.  We have all seen the mid 80's Toyota pickup still going strong with over 200k miles and I am maintaining the belief that this truck will do the same.  Nice ride for a small truck. If you are over 5'10"" tall the standard cab bench seat will be uncomfortable.  Few trucks get 27- 29 highway mpg.  Plenty of power for getting around town and up to speed on the highway.  However, the truck is beyond sluggish with any significant payload. Radio changed stations automatically and the volume didn't work at times.  Received replacement unit after 2 months of waiting and it does the same thing.  Toyota has recall out for floor mats and pedal assembly.","Gas mileage is easy on the wallet, quality bed liner, easy of use on interior controls, bold styling, 5000 miles between oil changes, cleat and tie system (although one did break), 3 stage paint.","Lumbar support for driver and bucket seats would be nice, a 2.7L I4 that takes six quarts of oil is a shortcut, replace stereo with functioning unit instead of wasting time and money with defective replacements, 3 recalls in 15,000 miles in disappointing."

Could never get comfortable, was like sitting on 2x6 six inches off the ground.  No interior storage space for tools, etc. as rear seat only folds down rather than seat portion folding up so very limited what can be carried in cab.  Limited sight lines & blind spots even w/ rear seat head rest removed. Don't believe resell value propaganda - was hard to sell even at sharp discount w/ 6K miles.

5,Love my Tacoma,Cleveland Ohio ,08/29/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased this truck new.  This is my first pick up truck.  It has lots of power for a 4 cyl and rides nice.  I purchased it as a second vehicle so I didn't get all of the extras just AC and sliding rear window.  It seems to get around 21-23 MPG mixed mostly city driving. A few months after driving it i did experience the feeling of riding over railroad tracks when decelerating.  I heard it was due to the torque converter not disengaging but since the tranny shifted excellent, I didn't want the dealer to mess with it.  It seems to have gone away on its own and I haven't noticed it all Summer.  I like the fact that if I get my speed up to 38 mph, the od kicks in and will stay eng down to 30.","Powerful 4cyl engine, nice riding, ice cold AC but don't really need it much with sliding rear window. Great MPG for a pickup truck.","get rid of the bench seats and offer bucket seats(I see that they have done this with the 2011 4x4 AT reg cab). Needs a locking tailgate.

My latest is a 6-auto with TRD Sport Package. Like others my 3rd radio solved the problem, but otherwise this truck is great.  I use it as a daily driver but often trailer full sized cars, which it handles easily. I test drove several different Tacos, and a Frontier before picking the TRD Sport.  I found the Off-Road too stiff, and the regular SR5 seats lacking.  I have no issues with the seating position some reviews mention.  The engine is noisy at idle with the hood open, but I don't consider the engine noisy at high speed on the highway.

The 4 cyl w/ the 4x4 and extended cab is adequate most of the time. The only time I notice it bogging out is on the highway going up a big hill. If you're going 70 mph prepare to drop to fourth to maintain 60 mph. Mixed feelings on the traction control; it, along with the abs seem to do more harm than good. Don't be afraid to turn it off (in the right circumstances that can be a lot of fun). Fuel economy is pretty good (~23 mpg. Lot of city driving). Excellent in the 50-60 mph range (keep the revs under 2k). My Buddy just bought a ranger, I'm shaking my head at the ""deal"" he got vs what he'll spend in gas.

I had trouble with passenger side window sometimes doesn't go down without driver first using driver side switch. Passenger side speaker seems blown out from the start.

3.375,wish i still had my old 99 taco,david ,02/10/2010,,,4,5,2,3,,3,4,3,3,traded my 99 for this thru the frame recall/buyback and have been very displeased. first didn't get delay wipers with basic package. had radio replaced before 10k kept going off/changing stations. clutch started slipping at 20k miles repaired under warranty. on hot days clutch pedal creaks. leaf springs started making creaking at 10k had new silencer pads installed under warranty. the traction buzzer is VERY annoying if you slide sideways. ice builds up around front output of t-case on wet slushy snowy roads makes bumping under floorboards. ,do like the cd player good under seat storage ,do real world testing before you sell a new model/feature. more quality control checks before sending out of factory

The truck is great looking, and seems to have good build quality and reliability.  However, at only 15k it does have a couple rattles and my radio has already gone out once (replaced by dealer).  Fuel economy at first was not great, but I actually get better MPG at 75 mph than at 65, probably averaging 18 mpg total.  The back seat in the Double Cab is tight for adults as it is - forget about it in the Access Cab.  Four adults drove from KS to CO, and the people in the back were slightly cramped (both below 5'10"").  The V6 is plenty powerful, and ride comfort is good for a truck (I drive 25k a year too).","Style with Sport package, front seat space, steering wheel controls, Aux input, backup camera, power and smoothness from V6.

This one has the 16 inch tire option and I can see there is already some inside tire wear. I'll be rotating tires every 5,000 miles to assure good tire wear.

It also lugs when under 30 mph. I have had it back to the Toyota dealer a couple of times asking what the problem is and can it be fixed?

I was worried it wouldn't do it but was pleasantly surprised, you can tell it's there but the v6 has no problem towing it.

I am very happy with my purchase. The truck rides great, handles well has plenty of storage and hauling ability.  I got the TRD sport model fully loaded with every option I could add. I really like the JBL stereo but the sub in the back seems to vibrate the plastic interior on particular notes but overall it sounds great and was a  good upgrade.  The v6 has plenty of power and acceleration to merge on the freeway or pull out into traffic. I loaded the bed up the second day we had it with a heavy reclining sofa and couldn't even tell it was there when driving.  ","I like the large interior, It feels like a car inside.

The offroad was totaled and I replaced with the sport model. Overall I like the truck and it's a keeper, nice acceleration, quality interior vs the competition, safety features are great - ie. my airbags worked on impact, and the frame crumpled and distributed the impact force properly where my cabin area stayed intact.  However, I won't buy another 6 to 10 yrs down the road unless Toyota can fix the rough ride, the spongy brakes, and improve the fuel economy by at least 2 MPG for the 4X4 model.",Backup Camera.

I traded in a 2006 Pathfinder LE for the Tacoma and it was the best decision I have ever made. The Nissan was not put together well and had rattles everywhere as well as a problem in the electrical system. The Tacoma seems to be built much tighter and better and has a great ride. It tows my boat without even knowing it it there. There is a slight rattle at 1100rpm in the passenger door but the dealership is going to take care if that quickly when I take it in for service. I would HIGHLY recommend this vehicle for anyone looking for a truck. It is simply put, A GREAT TRUCK!",Love the availability of the long bed with the double cab.

Yes, freaky radio (turns on all by itself) and poor reception for some reason. The hunting transmission drives me crazy. Sensation like you're spinning your wheels on ice.

I ruled out the Honda Ridgeline because its undercarriage is more vulnerable. The Tacoma is designed for high clearance, and low roll-over risk, which means the floor is high and the roof is low. The transmission and transfer case are well protected. Everything else, including Tacoma's flaws, derive from these design goals.  The fronts seats are low. Toe room is bad in back. With side airbags and stability control, it is the safest thing out there. The roof meets 2010 IIHS standards for a ""good"" rating. ","Safety features. Braking. Low end torque of engine. Acceleration.  Light weight for what it is. Red panel lighting at night. Transmission is quick to lock up the torque converter after shifts, thus very efficient. Steering.  ","Should add lighting to the 4WD selector switch.  If you hit snow in the dark, you have to find it by feel. Add height adjustment to front seats.  Kill the beep when remote locking.

Mileage could be much better with a little effort from Toyota. The body looks good for a little truck.  I had a TPMS and radio problems, but the dealer fixed them.

The transmission setup on this truck however is anything but nice and the brakes are too weak.  The transmission hunts under 45 mph and the always on engine braking in ""D"" is VERY annoying.  You can't roll down smooth.  Also, the upshift to second is hard and the entire downshift from 5 (which the tranny races to get to) is hard in every gear.

The Tacoma, to me, rides like a car with the benefit of a truck.  I owned two Ford Rangers previous to this purchase, and the difference is night and day.  Interior is superb and luxurious compared to the Ranger's plain design.  Seats are more comfortable but the seats are lower, which is the only dislike I have about this vehicle.  I'd much prefer to sit up a bit higher.  I feel a bit like driving a Miata with my legs out rather than in a normal sitting position. ","Cockpit and instrumentation, soundproofing is outstanding.

This thing has a totally plastic (plastic!) box, I'm not talking a steel bed lined with plastic, but plastic! ",Great heater; relatively quiet.  Red back-lit gauges are pretty nice. ,"Get rid of the TPMS; dash lights on even in the daytime? C'mon.  How about adding a 4th leaf to the rear springs, like your competition does, so you can actually haul something? Steel does come in varieties that have low rust properties. A completely plastic bed box -- you have got to be kidding! "

I wanted to put the hype to the test and took it 4 wheeling and it did not disappoint.  Rides like a car with exceptional power.  Luv this truck.,The less boxier designed and the backup cam is a plus! ,"better fuel millage, although not too bad compared to other mid-size trucks! "

4.75,A pleasure,feesey ,11/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,4,"This truck surpasses my 2 previous  Toyota trucks in comfort and features, inside and out. Last Toyota was a '99 SR5 4x4. After 10 great years, lost to the '08 frame recall for which I was reimbursed .  No  other vehicle  was better in its class. Looking at fuel prices and my new status as a senior, a modest baseline, 4x4 4 banger was my choice. I tested heavily before I bought, steep mountain grades on gravel to blacktop straightaways with 1/4 ton of clay aboard (quite a sight at the dealership!). Pleasantly surprised at power and agility. The 2.7-4 really performs, unexpectedly quiet, watch the tach. Front  transmission is now on a switch - nice touch. Cab is roomy.","Bed of the truck is sprung heavier than the 99, like you are actually going to haul stuff! Liner is well designed for easy cleaning  haulage and storage. Those  extra 2 doors actually make the back useful. Better braking on bigger wheels.","When you have mounted snows on separate wheels, necessary here in Canada, it causes a warning light on the dash. Please fix this."

The one thing I said when the Tacoma came out in 2005 was I wanted Charcoal Gray! Well, that happened this year and I love it. I got a Magnetic Gray 4x4 V6 Double Cab SB TRD Off-Road. I love it! All the new features are so easy to use and work exceptionally well! I have my iPod hooked up to the JBL sound system, my phone linked to the bluetooth! In a truck! ",4x4. Gotta have the 4x4.

4.5,Ain't Nothing Like A Truck,Back to the Future ,10/30/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"I finally decided on the buying another Toyota after owning number of other cars in between, including a Honda Pilot and Volvo XC70.  Wanted the cargo carrying capacity of a truck, but not something monstrous in size. But it seems like all trucks have gone on steroids over the years; the '09 Tacoma is bigger than the '00 Tundra I owned. Didn't get a 4X4 to save on purchase and fuel costs. Usual good fit and finish from Toyota; feels solid. Although compared to the Honda Pilot, not as well engineered: small things like the center console storage compartment that opens from the driver side instead of from the front that would allow better access to front- passengers; not as clever on storage.",Good power for a V6.  Backup camera works well day or night. Built-in bluetooth is handy; especially in CA where hands-free cell communication is required.  Like the XM radio feature.,"Add: lighted passenger-side vanity mirror, better storage, more AC power ports.  Move the gear shift to front console or steering column to free up more space.  Tougher seat fabrics (fabric stains easily).  Make backup camera screen larger."

4.875,An Awesome Buy,JP ,10/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just bought the 4 door in the magnetic charcoal grey color.  All I can say is it is an awesome looking truck, that rides excellent.  Toyotas are very reliable cars, everyone in my family has one, so I do not worry about having bought an unreliable product. ","The Back Up camera on the tailgate with the monitor seamlessly integrated into the rear view mirror.  It pops up when the car is in reverse.  The JBL audio package sounds great, and I can play my iPod with the Aux input.  The sport seats are comfortable.  There are plenty of storage areas in and out","Chrome grill, door handles, and side view mirrors would look great.  The color of the stereo and lights behind dash readings are orange, I hate orange.  A mechanically adjusting driver seat would be nice as well. At cruising speed, a cylinder shutoff mechanism to save gas would be nice."

4.75,my 5th ,PBucks ,10/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,4,This is my 5th Tacoma and like all the others like it a lot.  My son took my '04 4 banger stick access cab to college.  So I picked up this automatic version as a replacement. So far I really like this bigger body style. I normally get the easiest color to keep clean but this new Barcelona red called out my name when I first saw it.  I get many compliments on the look of the truck.  Must say though I miss the manual transmission.  I've been checking the fuel mileage and it is 24 MPG.  I was thinking about getting a full size Ford or Chevy this time for less money but I'm really glad I stayed with the Tacoma.  I think they are the best and most useful mode of transportation for my needs.,Big truck feel in a medium package.  I find the rearview camera to be helpful once you get used to it.,Like someone said earlier it needs some type of cast wheel option.  The stamped silver steel wheels look lousy with the bright red color.  Also wished the optional fog lights were a plug and play kit that you could buy.

I read a lot on the net before I made the move because a lot of reviewers says the truck is very bumpy. After a road test of a 2006 one, I found the truck very comfortable. Yes it is a little bumpy but not really more than any other trucks on the market. Road handling is incredible, the trucks really eats curves. Lots of torque below 2000 RPM from the engine so it makes it very fun to drive, you can literally declutch the truck in 1st gear normally without slip, without giving gas and the engine won't shake or stall. Subwoofer is a good idea but is very badly calibrated, too much bass in voices when listening to radio.","Engine has plenty of torque at all RPMs New MP3-WMA radio easy to navigate the MP3s Back-up cam is a MUST if you haul a trailer to mount it. New barcelona red is very very nice, 6 speed is smooth as butter clutch is easy to operate +++","Install a real 8 inches little subwoofer and calibrate it correctly to play below 120hertz.

I also have a 2006 Toyota FJ cruiser, 4 liter V6 auto, so it is interesting to compare the two vehicles. I have not found the 2.7 liter to be under powered, also the ride is more comfortable because of the longer wheel base. One of the reasons for getting the Tacoma was because of the good fuel economy that I experienced with the FJ Cruiser which replaced a Jeep Liberty.","Like the fuel economy of the 2.7 liter also the the comfort level, which I believe to be the best of any truck that I have ever owned. The Tacoma also handles well on gravel roads.","The user manual for both the Tacoma and the FJ cruiser are very obtuse when it comes to describing the ATRAC. In the Tacoma you can turn it off, however I do not know it if it works in 4x4 mode. For the FJ Cruiser you can not turn it off, though it implies in the manual that you can "

It appears as though the comfort of the rear seats has been compromised because of the extra features that they had to come up with because of the competition.  Am I the only one who has seen a change between 2008 to 2009??  Yes 2009 has newer features, finally side airbags!  But, if you seat in the rear on the 2008 and then seat in the rear of a 2009 you will be shocked.  I guess those new features need to be offset by compromising on the comfort?

Happy with fuel economy overall, getting advertised numbers or a little better. Looked at 4cyl 5spd for better MPG but decided to go with V6 auto and no regrets. Stereo is OK for me, like the MP3 playback. Didn't get TRD, not worth the difference in price for me. Lots of new safety features on the 09 played a big part on my decision to go new. This is my 4th Toyota, 3rd truck and all have proven reliable so far. I loved my 97 taco but this truck is way better in many ways and I'm sure we will have a long, happy life",Powerful V6 and smooth 5spd auto. MP3 playback stereo with steering wheel control. Rear doors. Composite bed with movable tie downs. Comfortable interior. Lots of storage. Overall look and feel of quality.,Add sunroof option. Make intermittent wipers standard.

It's not as tough of a truck as I'm used to (No TRD pkg.), but the double-cab has great passenger room for a compact and the composite bed is big enough for the things I need.  Got the bed-extender just in case it was too short.  The 6-speed is MUCH easier to shift than the Ford. Only had it a week, but I haven't had to pull into a gas station yet!

The interior is very roomy and there are storage throughout.  I purchased the top of the line model, TRD Offroad package, with the Bluetooth and reverse camera.  AWESOME features that are new to 2009. Love the LED taillights which are essential for the reverse camera at night.  I also love the new Magnetic Gray color, which puzzles me why this color was never available on Tacomas before.  This  truck has exceeded all my expectations and I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for a mid-size truck.  The only negative is the high price.","Bluetooth, Magnetic Grey color, LED Taillights, iPod connectivity, interior room and storage, and great looks.

Was looking at an '08 ($1,000 rebate), but the '09 has better standard features; 6 airbags, 4-wheel ABS, plus traction and stability control. That, with the new for '09 Timberland Green color, swung my vote. Granted, the '92 is a 4X4, but the '09 rides so much better. The interior is a huge improvement - as some '08 reviews said, it's very car-like - although outward visibility to the sides is better in the '92. I live up a steep hill; the 4-cylinder has plenty of power and, contrary to some, I like the gated shifter. 23 mpg in mixed driving; less than 500 on the odometer. Expect to get better than the 25 hwy EPA once it's broken in. ","Standard safety features. Interior appointments. Back-up camera (kind of ""gimmicky"" - but it works). Ride. Overall quality. Quiet engine - I couldn't hear it at first; had to look at the tach to make sure the engine was running. Very easy truck to drive. I'm enjoying the better mpg than my '92 gets.","Add fog-lights as an option on the base Access-Cab; had to buy PIAA aftermarkets that would fit the openings. Better tires than the Bridgestones would help, and an alloy wheel option on the base would also be welcome - the stamped-steel wheels are awful. Improve the outward visibility to the sides."

Fit and finish are excellent. Ride rivals that of my wifes grand Cherokee (car like). Only thing I am having trouble with is you cant hear the engine and it is a manual tranny. I have always just shifted on instinct and now I have to use a tach. I guess the trade off is the very quiet ride. All the standard safety features are nice (6 airbags, trac cont, 4 wheel abs all base model stuff now). I will get the monitor for the tailgate cam, will help with hooking up the trailer.   This is my 8th Toyota vehicle, and it appears they have hit yet another grand slam.","STAR safety, quiet smooth ride, quality build.
