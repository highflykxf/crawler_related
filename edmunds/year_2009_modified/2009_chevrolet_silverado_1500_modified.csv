4.75,Last Truck I will need to buy,lrdillon ,01/06/2015,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought this truck used with 60K miles.  I now have over 90K. I have only replaced the battery and tires.  Runs like a dream so far, tows great and very comfortable.  Hope to baby this for the rest of my life, I just retired.  With regular maintenance I have had no mechanical problems with a small V8.","Lots of comfort, very easy to drive on long trips.",
2.5,Should have gone with my gut..,offroadgoonie ,08/22/2014,,,2,4,2,1,,1,4,2,4,"I'm going to lay it straight. This was a solid truck for the first few months of owning it. Owned this for about a year and since purchasing, I've replaced the engine twice, had a transmission give out, and the heads get completely destroyed. ""only"" 72k miles on the truck, 2k miles on the new engine and about 1k miles on the transmission. Looks wise, this truck is flawless. It's a crew cab, although it might as well be an extended cab with the leg space.. but the interior is clean and looks amazing. I'm mainly concerned because I was told how great gmc/chevy is and how Ford and Dodge suck.. ya ok. Tried it and you've failed so I'm going back to my reliability. Piece of crap. No thank you!","Interior design actually was very clean, very comfortable. Like stated in my review, I love it.. however if i could change anything other than the trucks reliability, it would be the length of the cab. I could have saved money and gone with an extended cab and gotten the same amount of room!
Exterior, looks awesome. I love the look of the Chevy pickups.","I'm not the expert, just the customer.. looks wise, I love it. I would just reconsider the design of the engine/transmission as a whole."
3.375,After only 5 years - too many things wrong with it,chevydriver2 ,12/06/2013,,,4,3,2,3,,3,4,4,4,"I've enjoyed the truck which I bought new in early 2009.At 1700 miles off warranty, I had to replacerear break cylinders that cost about $1,100 all in.Too much too soon.I've been burning oil like crazy.I took it in to have that repaired.It turns out there is a dealer bulletin on it.That means they did a big repair job for free because I got it in at under 100K miles.Apparently excessive oil usage was a big and noted problem. On the same visit I replaced to door lock motors $500, to rear window switches $250 and a solenoid that was causing an engine light $400.I just think that this is two long and expensive a list for a truck that is 5 years old with only 86K miles on it.",Blue tooth.,"Make all the door locks and window switches last longer.

2,Don't buy one,aggieof10 ,01/21/2013,,,2,3,1,1,,1,4,1,3,"Within a month of buying this truck, all of the power locks went out. Chevy replaced them for free since it was under warranty. Then my rear power window stopped working, transmission is spotty, cant decide when to shift, tpms comes on at random times telling me my tires are flat (they arent). Put groceries in the back seat one day, and the pocket on the back of drivers seat ripped out. Turns out, they aren't sewn in at the factory, someone is there with a staple gun putting them on. Wind caught the door last week, and pulled the hinges away from the body, now the door grinds on the body work every time I open it. I am absolutely furious with this truck.

3.75,Not what I was expecting from GM,joel1235 ,09/08/2012,,,4,5,3,3,,4,4,3,4,"I purchased the truck used in November 2010 with 17K on it and the fun started about a week later. First my battery needed replacement, but then it spent a few days at the dealer looking for a popping noise they never found and is still happening. Next was a rough idle/check engine light. It was fixed a week later. Around 35K the transfer case needed replaced. At the dealer another week. This week the rough idle/check engine light thing started again(40K). An independent shop told me it was the same trouble code as last time, and that the problem was with the piston rings, and I may need a new motor. I wish I could go on, but I'm running out of space.",Great interior/exterior styling. Four-wheel drive. Better gas millage than competitors.,"Get the bugs out before these trucks are offered to the public GM! We will not continue to do your R&D for you for much longer. I've always been a Chevy fan/defender, but this truck has made me swear off GM for good.

It now has 110,000 miles on it. I have done nothing except change the rear breaks. I added dual exhaust. It runs as good as it did when it was new. At 70-75mph I get 19 mpg. In town around 15mpg.The truck is very dependable. I have driven other Chevy trucks as sale vehicles and 300,000 miles is not hard to get out of these trucks.

4.375,So far.....great,freeflowin ,10/03/2011,,,3,4,5,5,,5,5,5,3,"I bought this new in 2009. My very first new vehicle ever. I bought it during Chevy's big rebate program and it was well worth it. I have the LT2 with leather bench seats. I truck rides down the highway so unbelievably comfortable that I forget I'm in a truck. It is smoother then my moms Cadillac and way smoother then my BMW or my wife's Liberty. I have 38k miles on and the tires are still almost new and it hasn't burnt a drop of oil. Working in the oil fields it has been dependable on ALL road conditions from the mountains of CO and UT to the ice sheets of ND, it has been great. When I had a company Ford F-150 XLT, after my 1100 mile drive to the rig,my back killed the next day, not this","Came with automatic starter, bluetooth, Sat Radio. Lots of monitors in the computer programming. Comfort. Lots of storage containers and cup holders. Good gas mileage for a bigger gas pickup. As good or better then the Liberty.","Better looking plastics, they look cheap and feel way cheap compared to my BMW. Bigger rear seat, I've never had a problem with it, but it is small compared to other companies. Option to turn off the Stabilitrak and have it STAY off.

3.375,Probably My Last GM Product,elucas78 ,09/19/2011,,,5,4,1,1,,3,5,4,4,"I have owned Chevy trucks for the last 14 years and kept coming back, until now. We were looking for a half ton crew cab and found this 2009 used in April 2011. Within 2 weeks of buying it, the Service Air Bag light came on. Took it to the dealer a couple times and the computer needed reset and a sensor needed replaced. It happened again, but this time the instrument panel needed replaced. Then last month the engine started ticking. Took it in on August 29th to find out it needs a new cam and lifters. This is not what I expected on a 2 year old vehicle with 35,000 miles. Well it has been 3 weeks and I still have yet to get it back. So, this will more than likely be my last GM product.",The interior is comfortable and easy to access everything.

4.625,First Chevy Truck,Bill ,11/06/2010,,,4,4,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"Owned Fords all my life and liked them. Used up a 99 Ford F 150 with Triton motor and needed another full size truck. Looked at all of them and decided to try my first Chevy and at 10,000 miles I'm glad I did. The new Chevy V8 with 8 to 4 cylinder technology and 6 speed automatic is getting me 20 mpg or better. Blown away by the gas mileage I'm getting with aggressive tires. Love the exhaust note of the engine. Far superior motor and transmission to my last F150 (Triton V8) and much better gas mileage. Very good ride in general and great truck for towing. The manual mode of the 6 speed transmission saves your brakes and the ""tow"" mode changes the shift points for better power. ","Six speed transmission, great brakes, ""tow"" mode and down hill rev limiter, gas mileage, ride and comfort, towing capacity, exhaust note, power of motor, fold up rear seats, looks inside and out. ","Turning radius too wide, seats collect lint, inside compartments poorly designed, power steering should have more feel, rubber bed liner instead of hard plastic, power rear window should be standard on LT package, mud flaps and plastic barrier to protect rear wheels from salt should be standard.

4.75,Overall Nice Truck,Steve ,09/19/2010,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"Like the truck overall, however, the passenger seat belt apparatus on the side of the door rattles every time one goes over a bump.  The 4 speed transmission did not perform well when hauling a toy hauler trailer (shifted in and out of higher gears and reved up to around 4500 rpm). Got very poor gas mileage while towing trailer (6mpg) and once when stopped engine compartment smelled like burnt oil.  ON-Star didn't indicate any problems with engine or transmission and later Chevy technicians could find nothing wrong.  Worried about pulling trailer in actual mountains instead of the Black Hills of SD.  Don't like the cloth seats, shows to much lint and is hard to clean.  ","Looks, engine performance of the 5.3, wide opening of the rear doors.",Back seats should recline a little bit more. All should come standard with 6 spd transmission.

I just hit 5,100 miles and all the lifters now need to be replaced. The service tech states that the oiling system oils too much so it blows by the lifters blows out tons of white smoke out of the exhaust constantly. To make matters even more disappointing is the lack of a quality and robust 6 speed transmission, it  has no clue how to pick a gear to stay in it. While driving if you make it downshift it will downshift and bring the engine to ""Redline"" or 6,000 rpm and stay there even if you take your foot off the gas pedal for at least 5 seconds.

I tow a 23 ft. boat and it strains a lot. I haven't towed my car and trailer yet, a little scared too. I live in Florida and there are no hills. I wish I would have up dated to the 6.0 litre.

The 5.3 Vortec w/6-speed auto is an amazing powertrain. My Silverado has the Automatic 4x4 with the factory 20"" rims & Z60 handling suspension package, not the Z71 package. Got the white exterior w/Ebony leather interior. The truck handles and drives remarkably well, but it is not made for off road use like the Z71.

I got lost in the Canadian north and they were unable to help me find my way out. The phone option also fails when you get into isolated areas. It's a little meager on power but it is only a 4.8.

It takes your eyes off the road too long. Why did they design the fog lights to only work with the lights on? Don't they know that when it's foggy, or blowing snow that the lower the lights are, the better? Also, the low beam lights should be the lower set of lights for the same above reason. Why is the rear floor not flat under the seats? I owned a 2002 Silverado that had more storage room. The 2009 took away alot of storage in the dash and console area. Also the storage in the doors is smaller. I really do think that a ""non"" truck user designed this new truck.",Nice smooth quite ride.,"More storage area in console and dash area.
