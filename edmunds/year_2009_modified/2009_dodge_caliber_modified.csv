5,Review of 2009 after 107K miles,The Baumgardners ,10/28/2016,,5,5,,,5,4,5,2,,,"We bought this car new from a dealer in Maryland.  My husband used it to commute long distances to work.  When it hit 70K, we bought a new car and I used the Caliber for my work commute.  We have had NO problems with this car.  The car I had before was a Saab, and this Caliber ran so much better.  We're getting ready to sell it now as we have 4 vehicles parked out front.  I would have no apprehension about driving this another 50K OR more.",,
1,Lemons Are Us,Bill Rafajko ,02/28/2016,1,5,3,,,1,2,3,4,,,This car is a dream lemon. If you love spending money; getting towed; frequently driving rentals and paying for them ... then this is the car for you.  I've decided to get the car painted lemon yellow as dreamy blue is a misnomer.,,

4.25,a happy ending,randrushka ,06/30/2014,,,4,5,4,4,,4,3,5,5,"We bought a 09 RT caliber from a dealer, cosmetically in mint condition, drove decent, stereo rocked, and got a fair price. Within 2 weeks it left us stranded, engine just shut off and lights on dash went crazy. After a lot of back-and-forth dealer finally found an aftermarket chip in the vehicle and convinced us to give it another try - I'm glad we did. Besides removing the chip, they upgraded the cars computer software. The acceleration was still marginal, but after I put one bottle of lucas gas treatment and replaced the plugs with bosch platinum +4 it accelerates fine, and we love the car. Now it runs like it just came out of the factory, and we plan on keeping it a while. ","Love the sporty exterior, and it runs great after a few minor upgrades. Fun to drive.",Only one thing I really don't care for - The stupid hollowed-out plastic headrest in the RT is godawfully uncomfortable. 
4.75,Nice Vehicle,queeniepreston ,10/04/2013,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,5,5,"I don't know why so many people are giving bad reviews. I drive the '09 SXT CVT 6 speed & automatic, sunroof, & it had 70,000 ml, ground effects, fog lamps, the seats can fold over & not to mention the cooler, & have driven it to for very long distances, up & down mountains. I only wish that I would've been on top of my game to actually take a look at the brakes, the inner wall of the tires, & strouts, this summer the 4 of us had a family reunion & we literally packed it up & headed up to Nashville, Tenn. & came back with extra stuff.It's a very handy vehicle, I can fit a huge brand new trash can without folding seats, guess it depends on how you drive your vehicle. Respect it.","Cooler, air conditioning, sunroof, wipers in the back & front, ground effects. Learning how to drive manual, then being able to switch back to automatic when I get tired of manual, keeping my drinks a little cooler when I use the air condition.","I wish it was a six cylinder or better yet, the company should've continued producing it, cause it's a dependable vehicle."
2.75,I've driven better.....,rlfeen ,09/14/2013,,,2,3,3,3,,3,3,3,2,"I am the second owner of my Caliber. It currently has 136k~ miles on it. Roomy car, love the exterior. Interior is nice, however the design hasn't aged well. A TON of plastic. Plastic is everywhere is there are NO soft touch materials except the headliner and seats. HORRIBLE suspension. Replaced lower control arms, ball joints, you name I've replaced it. Luckily I bought a GREAT warranty. Drives great on the highway. Smooth and quiet.city driving is okay, hate the CVT especially in the city. Feels like it takes for ever to get up and go. (it is a larger car so I guess this is expected). Paint is still pretty good. I have black so it shows EVERY flaw.","Smooth and quiet, especially on the highway. Exterior looks. Great for hauling stuff. I hauled a 5x8' UHAUL from MD to AZ and it did just fine. 

Pretty reliable. Starting to age and I will be getting rid of it soon. ","Obviously Dodge just scrapped the whole design of the Caliber after a 5 year run. The Dart is a lot better. 

Suspension, quality in general, paint, interior. 

Had to replace alternator, fuel pump, A/C compressor, all of suspension. "
2.5,Junk,gedged ,06/21/2013,,,3,3,3,2,,1,3,3,2,"First, the car is a total slug. Makes alot of noise and goes no where. If you're merging onto the highway, PLAN AHEAD. If there is a vehicle coming, let it go by to give you a LONG launch pad... The auto trans is the worst unit I have seen. It's variable = junk. Finally- the antifreeze problem. When I left the dealership, the car overheated 5 minutes down the road. The radiator was only a 1/4 full!!!! After that, I would have to fill it every week...No puddles under the car, no obvious leaks, clean oil.. So, where did the fluid go?!?! In closing, with exception of the gas mileage, this was the biggest auto purchase MISTAKE I have made!!!!",,
4.25,Caliber on Fire,losam ,03/06/2013,,,4,4,4,4,,5,4,4,5,"Until now I have had no problems; but 12 minutes into my commute to work on February 28th proved to be fatal for my car and the truck parked beside it.There was the odor of something burning so I turned of everything electrical that I could think of that might be the cause. After coming to a complete stop in the parking lot at my workplace, I noticed steam coming from under the hood and the odor of antifreeze. Three minutes later, the engine compartment totally engulfed in flames resulting in a total lose 20 minutes later. The fire was so hot that its color was almost white. Still waiting to hear what caused the fire. Only 28,600 miles on this ride!","Heated seats, Sirius xm radio, Fuel effeciency(23mpg - City -- 28mpg - Highway), Easy to park, 115-volt outlet, Chill-Zone beverage storage, and the powerful feel of the 2.0, 4-cylinder engine (Nice).","Overall a nice ride while it lasted. The only suggestion, find the reason for the fire before someone becomes a fatality.
Five more minutes behind the wheel of this car and I might have become that fatality."
4.25,Not luxurious but decent little ride,bryancpe ,06/02/2012,,,3,5,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"I bought this car new and I've put 66000 miles on this car without a need for any repairs. The ride is comfortable but not luxurious by any means. The ride is fairly smooth and gets great mileage. Typically I get 30-31 mpg. On long interstate trips I get about 28. Why you might ask do I get lesser mpg? It has a tiny engine (2.0L) that works harder to maintain 70+ mph speeds. I keep up with the maintenance religiously as I live in the hot desert of Arizona and want this vehicle to last. The vehicle idles heavy and is weak on the acceleration. The cabin isbit small but I do have two toddler car seats in the back seat. Cargo space can be limited, especially with a big stroller. Does the job!","The gas mileage is the best feature. The price point for this vehicle is just right. 
Dodge put a lifetime warranty on the drive train on this model year for original owners. That means as long as I maintain the vehicle properly and drive it for the next couple decades that they still cover it. When used for cargo, ALL the seats can fold down (minus the driver obviously). I carried 8 foot objects before.",Solve the heavy idling (vibration) problem. Need a better armrest (maybe add a pad). More convenient passenger drink holder. Improve driver left leg space because it is a bit tight.
2.625,2009 Caliber,sm3230 ,05/11/2011,,,3,4,2,2,,2,2,3,3,"I boughtthis car with 27000 miles on it and now I have just under 52000, and the transmission went. The warranty expired at 36000, so if you are going to buy one of these cars, beware ! How dare they charge you for an extended warranty, when they know that the product they are selling is crap....",Great gas mileage,"Dodge should stand behind what they build, not put the burden on the buyer to pay for an extended warranty, knowing full well that there are transmission problems with this auto. Look back at other years, the tranmissions seems to be a commmon link."
4.875,Great car!,Jaime ,10/17/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have had my car for just over a year and it has AMAZING gas mileage! Even in the city i was getting anywhere from 25-28 MPG. Even got 30 MPG in the mountains! Going from a vehicle with 18 MPG freeway to this is SO nice. The back is roomy and fits a ton! Its a quiet ride and smooth and has some giddy up and go to it for a small engine.,"Sirius Radio, Option for Hands Free connection, Spacious back compartment, Plastic on back of front seats good for when you have kids they wont mess up the fabric like other vehicles!",Wish there was a turbo available for purchase down the road would be nice since there is space but other than that NONE.
4,Unsure,LaVerne ,09/22/2010,,,3,5,4,3,,4,4,5,4,"Within the 1st month the tire pressure sensor had gone up.  Within a few months later the tire stem on the other side of my car had snapped and once again had to get another tire pressure sensor.I went to the dealer about this and was told the tire stems break often and the company was unsure why.  The car looks great on the outside but when dealing with the interior it is weak.Because it looks like a truck I was assuming it had power but it doesn't have much.  My brakes squeaked at 40,000 miles and I had the brakes checked and was told this was normal. Air filter needs to be change a lot. One word this car is affordable but may need early repairs.","Lit cup holders, good on gas,hatch cover,",Improve tire stems since it is attached to a sensor which is costly. Ability to remove the hatch cover bar so you can have more hatch space when needed. Lit door locks or some kind of lighting on the door.
4.75,Caliber is a great small car!,jken02 ,09/19/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I have almost 30,000 miles on my Caliber and it has been an excellent car.  I've seen some of the other Caliber reviews, where the owners had immediate problems, all I can say is that my car has been outstanding with zero issues.  I've owned seven different Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep products over the past 20 years, and they have been fantastic cars.  Nice cars, great prices, and the reliability has been outstanding.","The fuel efficiency is my favorite feature.  I've been getting very good mileage, averaging 31 mpg, and that is with both city and highway driving.  My car has the 5-speed, so that obviously gives me an mpg advantage.","I rated the interior/comfort as both 8.  The reason: I felt the interior could have been nicer/upgraded.  They seem to have done that for 2010/2011, since the newer Calibers have a much more stylish and refined interior."
1.375,Poor Ride,Gill ,08/07/2010,,,1,2,1,1,,2,1,2,1,"I wish I would have bought something else. The gas mileage is terrible for this size car. I get about 24-28 mpg when the information I had said 33 mpg. I have only 36,500 miles on it and it has a terrible suspension noise and will need to go in shop next week. I have already told several people who asked me if I liked this car ""DO NOT BUY THIS CAR. The seating is comfortable for me but the interior is very awkward in its layout, everything is very tight. The car is OK for its exterior styling but the sheet metal is very thin. If you close the door with the window open it feels like the door is going to ripe off the hinges The CVT transmission makes odd sounds in slow traffic.",Driver seat is comfortable,Better quality control.
5,1st new car,javaman ,07/11/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Cash for Clunkers was a huge help.  I got rid of my 90 Ford Aerostar, just in time.  The first week I had it I loaded it up and drove my oldest to college, after a year of ownership I have dealt with a couple huge snow storms, at one point I had driven into snow so deep that from the windshield forward was under snow, I dug out the front wheels and backed right out.  The daily driving is fun I travel back roads to work that have hills and turns and this little 5-speed with a 1.8l engine sticks to the road and is quite fun.  I love the features, and it is a great car.  ","The radio, and Satellite radio are cool.  The millage is great, it's quick responsive and agile.  The wheels are nice too, and the silver paint.",Black carbon-fiber hood with cowl induction would be cool.
4.875,Way Cooler Than a Minivan!,Sandi ,07/01/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've owned my Caliber for a year now and my husband and I have been very pleased with it. After driving a Chevy Venture for 10 years, I was really excited to have something sportier and I have not been disappointed. This car is fun to drive and and it looks great. I still get a lot of compliments on it. The controls are easy to use, it handles well and has been completely reliable. ","Sirius radio, cool exterior, good gas mileage, lots of cargo room, light up cup holders!, three seat belts in back, dependable, handled well in the snow",I wish the door locks lit up-very hard to find in the dark.

4.75, I love my Caliber,Sheila ,06/17/2010,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just bought  my Caliber this week So far it has  been a blast to drive. I was so surprised how much pep it's got for a small engine. It's also very smooth, you don't even feel the gear shift, I love that. I also love the way it feels like an SUV but looks like a sporty car. So far I love everything about it.","smooth transmission,  exterior sporty design , illuminated cup holders, 3 compartment glove box","I wish the rear window went down, that would be nice."
5,I love my Spunky!,musicmamma ,04/26/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I turned in my Durango and decided I needed something smaller with better gas mileage. I always name my cars, so after I took it on a particular drive I found out that it was so ""Spunky"" for a 4 cylinder that I named him spunky. He drives great, gets great gas mileage and was a perfect buy for me. Within my first month I drove him to Williamsburg VA and back to PA, he took only a tank down and one back. I had 3 total passengers, all of us rather large in the middle and we enjoyed the ride and the cost. ","spunky engine, super gas mileage, drives great, looks great, good car.","Maybe a sun roof, power seats. "
4.75,Really nice car,Ian ,04/25/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I have owned this car for several months and, overall, it is really a nice car.  It is the SE base model with the 1.8 liter engine.  I bought the manual shift as I am using it to tow behind my RV.  I added cruise control, power windows and power door locks.  I would not recommend anyone to install the above after market stuff as it has been kind of a hassle, but it all works well.  I have no idea why any auto company would sell a car without cruise, power windows, door locks and mirrors, it just does not make sense.  The car is slightly slow if you want to race another driver, but overall is powered with the manual just fine.  There is a blind spot at the rear sides, use rear view mirrors.","Nice comfortable driving position, nice to shift and a pleasant car that feels safe to drive.  Good room in the rear.","For automakers, don't sell cars that don't have cruise, power door locks, mirrors and power rear view mirrors."
4.25,Great car for the money,RW ,02/22/2010,,,4,5,5,4,,4,4,4,4,"Drove a couple when test riding, along with some other vehicles in the price range.  Read some reviews about low power so I was a little concerned but not much.  Car is fine.  Drives great.  If you like the look and the price go ahead and get it. Bought this car for the wife, in town driving with a 20 minute commute to work.  Surprised she liked it.  It was her call.  Turned in a 2000 Honda Accord that we drove to its death. ","Sits high almost like an SUV. Lighted cup holders are cool.  Looks muscular aggressive for a wagon/hatchback, like most Dodge's.  Roomy back seat.","No issues so far, still new to us. "
1.5,Worst car ever made,Jessica ,02/05/2010,,,2,1,1,1,,1,3,1,2,"We haven't had it long but I really wish I would not have bought it. So far it stinks in gas mileage. Gets a total of 20-25 mpg. At first I thought the gas handle was broke and the company promised to fix it in 3 months. We call back and they say 3 more months. It cant move in snow, I got stuck in my drive way but me buick got out just fine. Its broken down with only 6252 miles on it. If you asked me ""should I buy this car?"" I would say NEVER EVER EVER buy this car.","My favorite feature is the built in cooler, but its not worth the trouble OR the price.",Nothing in the WORLD could make me buy this car. Im trading it in tomorrow for a better car.
3.25,Horrible rental!!!,BunyLuvr ,01/16/2010,,,2,5,4,4,,2,4,4,1,"UGH! I rented this car on a trip recently and chose it because I love small hatchbacks; I drive a 2008 VW Rabbit at home. My college-age son, who couldn't care less about cars, immediately noticed the poor quality interior compared to our Rabbit. ""Is this an American car?"" he asked - and I doubt he would not say that about a newer Ford. Driving this thing is not pleasurable after driving German cars, either. It's just adequately powered, and the steering is not responsive at all. The car gets points for exterior styling, and I assume it's fairly reliable, but if you're looking for a small hatch, check out the Mazda3, new Golfs, Honda Fit, etc. before saddling yourself with this blah-burger",Exterior styling is very nice. Ever since the model came out I've liked the looks of it.,Improve cabin materials. They are seriously shoddy compared to other vehicles in this class which I drove when shopping for a small hatchback. Needs more power. Seating very awkward/uncomfortable.
5,6000 Miles No Problems - Like the Car,Charles ,01/11/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have the SE trim with automatic CVT and  2.0 motor.  I like the car.  Best feature is the high seats.  Worst feature is the right side mirror.  I had to buy a small round mirror to correct the blind spot. On the highway I hit 70-80+ mph and the car handles well. I like the way  CVT as it does not shift, it provides constant acceleration.  When it was new, it took about 50 miles to start driving well.  It just seemed like the car needed a break in period.  I did not purchase the lifetime warranty as the power train is covered for life time of the original owner. I did a great deal of research on the problems with the Caliber.  It seems the 2007... continued...",It seems the 2007 year models had a number of issues.  My 2009 runs well and I have had NO issues with the car. I am happy and recommend the car.

4.75,"May be better, but not for the price",demonic_celery ,12/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"Purchased a brand new R/T almost 6 months ago with leather package, sunroof, 6CD changer with 9 speakers(2 of which drop down from hatch door) and a year of sirius and a chrome package for under $20k. Getting ~28mpg. I did look at many other hatchbacks, and there are a few better out there, but you will pay a premium for a ""better"" new one than this. And buying new, having a LIFETIME powertain warranty, come one, VALUE. Alot of consumers don't seem to quite realize what a lifetime powertrain warranty means for value, if you take care of everything else, you can drive this for decades. I have seen the touchscreen in action for the stereo with bluetooth, and plan on upgrading to that in time.","Lifetime Warrenty! Stereo System. Completely adjustable height and lumbar seating.

3,There are better hatches,himoses ,12/01/2009,,,3,2,2,5,,3,4,3,2,"I have now had the displeasure of driving the Caliber.  This is not a bad car compared to garbage made in the 1980s, but is far inferior to a lot of hatches on the market.  This car drives like a brick.  If you get a good deal, then I could see this being a decent commuter car if you only drive on the highway.  If you like to drive, find something else.  My personal affordable favorite hatches are the Hyundai Elantra Touring and the Mazda 3.  This car is not in either of these cars league.",Higher seating position on the road.  Low cabin noise and decent suspension.,"Poor acceleration.  Transmission shifts roughly.  Gas mileage is subpar.  Very boisterous, whiney engine if you push it.  Ugly car.

5,Great car!,KD ,10/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I took advantage of the cash for clunkers and got an amazing deal on this car.  I have been driving a Mazda Protege 5 for the last 8 years.  While the Caliber cannot compare to the Mazda in terms of performance, it is still a great car.  It is a bit sluggish on takeoff, but using the CVT option takes care of that.  My gas mileage has steadily increased as the engine has broken in and I am now averaging 29-30 mpg city and highway combined.  My 6' friends are very comfortable in the backseat and have plenty of leg and head room.

I am still disappointed about he termination of Neon, but I am extatic about this Dodge.  Great mileage at 32-33 mpg..(I haven't taken it on a trip yet).  The ride is superb and handling is great.  The power is more than adequate, even with the tiny engine.  I am very happy with the Caliber overall.

After trading in my old Dakota and taking advantage of a $5,000 rebate from Dodge, I purchased a new orange Caliber for $11,500 out the door!   After looking at a fit, I decided to go this route instead.  It is much larger, roomier, and better looking in my opinion.  The gas mileage is great for a car of this size!

I'm not knocking my hot little black convertible it was just time to put it down. And it came at the absolute perfect time. With 218,000 miles I traded that Jeep for a brand new 2009 Dodge caliber. I got 3,500.00 for the clunker and then Dodge matched it with an additional 3,500.00. Best deal ever! I love it. I have air conditioning, speed, good gas mileage, and it's so quiet.

This car is one of the best cars I have found for day to day driving. It has everything you need and even some extras. This car has it all over the Ford Escort wagon that I traded in for the Caliber. I have been a design engineer for many years, so I feel that I can say with some authority, that this car is a good solid machine with no serious design flaws. It will last for many years in daily driving with very few problems (no - I don't work for an auto company!).

A little more attention to minor cosmetic details would not hurt either. And, as always - no one would cry if the gas mileage were a bit better"
4.875,Great car,Surfer boy ,08/07/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We love the Caliber SXT.  It is like a small version of the Ford Edge.  The CVT transmission is great.  Good fuel economy and sporty.  We looked at the Honda Fit and Nissan Versa.  This car drives way better and feels like a car, not a toy.  I would highly recommend the car.  For the money, no one comes close to such a car.  Best of all, it is American made in Illinois.","Drivers sear raises and lowers straight up and down.  Sirius radio is awesome, as well as the chill zone glove box.  Lifetime powertrain warranty is unmatched by competitors.  Rear seats have plenty of leg room.",A little more fabric on the door panels would look nice.  Otherwise it looks great!
4.875,Love my car,BDR ,08/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Just bought the SXT and love it.  Plenty of power, great handling, and fun features make it a joy to drive.  Beautiful finish and design.  Quality great.  This is my first smaller car, and very impressed.","Sunroof, overall design, conveniences like flashlight and remote entry.  Comfortable for size.  Easy to get in/out of.  Transmission really smooth.","More knee room in front, better position for cup holders."
5,Cushy Riding Sleek Best Deal,jonwest ,08/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I selected the Caliber SXT a/t w/2.0 CVT. I drove 4 models over two months. The total rebates motivated me to buy, plus my shiny Red Caliber was a minimum of 20% less compared to competitors model's which would have fit my wants and needs.  It has plenty of power for my mountainous terrain.  It's quick enough to pass others safely on two lane roads.  At 25 to 45 it provides a comfortable stress free ride. It's smooth, even ""cushy."" Same applies when driving at 70 mph on busy interstate highways.  It fits a lot of gear: boxes, cases, stuff, amps, guitars, keyboards, drums, even an upright bass!  My wife also likes driving it.","Seats- material and feel; dash design,  stereo and ac/heat. vent control accessibility; overall feel when driving or stopped; Overall exterior lines and look. Front grille that looks like the famous RAM truck; back lights and rear spoiler; movable arm rest and three internal storage compartments.","Mug-holder slits should be at 11 and 4 not 9 and 3. The emergency brake at 3 o clock interferes with sitting a mug into the recessed cup-holders. You can only fit a mug with a handle in one way, and even then the handle presses to tightly against the driver's seat cushion.  "
5,What a wonderful car!,ejman ,07/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased after test driving the Scion XD, Nissan versa, Nissan Cube, KIA Soul, Chevrolet HHR.  The Caliber is a far more substantial car, not ""tiny"" feeling at all.  I got the 1.8 engine with the 5 speed manual transmission.  What an outstanding combination.  The car feels wonderful, corners really flat with great handling.  Just took it out yesterday to the coast on a really windy hilly road.  Great passing ability, pulls up just fine on hills. (Also 35+ MPG). It hit 111 yesterday, the AC works just great no problem at all keeping up with that heat on next to the lowest setting on the AC.","Great AC! Great handling, solid feeling, very comfortable on the road. 35.8 MPG! Controls and stick shift very handy, lots of room, very well equipped for very little $$$.",Can't think of any at the moment.
4.75,2009 Dodge Caliber SXT 2.0 CVT,Dodge Man ,07/17/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,All I can say about this car is that it has everything you need and more and for 2009 they have really cut down on wind and engine noise from 2007 and for 2010 they are getting a new interior.,Everything,None
5,This Caliber Rocks!,Bullrun ,07/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I'll say it right away... getting 33MPG and car is only two weeks old - 5 speed manual.  60% Hwy / 40% City Driving.  Ride is comfortable.  Bumps in road jolt the car, but not too bad.  Quiet ride for type of car.  Road noise is average I'd say.  Toys inside are fun.  GPS/MyGig unit is great.  Downloading music is simple.  Steering Wheel controls are great!  UConnect bluetooth is the best!  Car looks great with all the angles and wheels.  Speakers are great.  Pretty loud, no distortion.  Handles well on corners.  Headlights are nice and bright.  Engine is quiet.  Nav works great with real time traffic info.     ",GPS / Nav / 9 Speaker System!  DVD's can be played while parked. Gas Mileage is awesome!  Haven't had a $30 gas tank for a long long time! Nice looking vehicle!,"R/T version should come standard with tinted windows, adjustable pedals, rear view camera and NAV.  Turning radius is not great.  Can't turn car around in neighborhood street.  Body kits are hard to find if you're trying to make this car look even sportier."
4.875,2009 Dodge Caliber SXT,SIMO86 ,06/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After looking at the 2010 Prius, 2009 Honda Fit, I've decided on the Caliber based on its superior exterior design, economical valve (cheapest of the three), safety features and roominess. Each of these categories, I found the Caliber had the advantage. Although the other two cars beat out my sexy Dodge in fuel economy, it would take years before the fuel economy to be an advantage since this car is $4000 cheaper than the Fit and $8000 cheaper than the Prius. I love the fact that I can fit my family of four comfortably. The ride is smooth. ",Love Sirius satellite radio. Hatchback feature allows for hauling versatility. Chill Zone. 110 Power Outlet.  ,Wished Electronic Vehicle Information Center came standard. Better fuel economy to complete with other compact cars.
5,IN A CLASS ALL IT'S OWN,shelli59 ,06/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased my Caliber only 3 weeks ago. I bought the car on the spur of the moment, and am happy to say it was an excellent choice. Compared to other cars in it's class, it is comfortably roomy and has good acceleration. And I've been getting 30+ mpg, driving both city and highway!  If you can love a car, then I've met my soul mate.",Overall sporty look and handling for a car in it's class. The stereo setup is great. Free sirius radio for a year and thumping speakers!,A door lock on the passenger side would be helpful.  I would like to have more possible positions for the drivers seat as well.
4.875,A Lot of Car for the Money,tomfann ,06/05/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Most professional reviews of the Dodge Caliber complain it is underpowered, has mediocre handling, and has a cheap interior. My wife and I could not disagree more. Our car is a joy to drive! The CVT and 2.0L engine rapidly accelerate the car with turbine-like smoothness. The steering is quick and responsive. The ride is firm (though was stiff when new). The car handles very well; I can't detect any body lean going around corners. The controls are quite intuitive and well thought-out. The fit'n'finish is flawless. The interior is tasteful, restrained, very comfortable, and very high quality. We haven't yet found one manufacturing defect. 27 mpg in mostly city driving. We love our Caliber!",Small car but very roomy and versatile interior; driver's seat height adjustable; high ground clearance; 3 compartments in glove box; can plug mp3 player into sound system; front pass. seat folds flat for long cargo; easy to change oil; chair-height seats; cargo tie-downs; removeable cargo light,Separate locks on pass. door and cargo area; jointed door mirrors for careless drivers; locking gas tank door; gauge lighting (black numbers on glowing white background) not as good as Neon's (white numbers on black background); audio bass way too boomy (though some will consider this a plus!)
5,What a nice Surprise!,artist ,06/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great for transporting to art fairs large pictures, etc.  Easy getting in and out of seats - love the set up of being higher in the seats looking out the wide span windows, makes one feel like sitting in a small jet cockpit!  I did however, pinstriped the sides at the top line with gold pinstriping and it really set it off!  Did'nt realize how much I would use the cold glove box until I left them in it and came out from shopping and they were still cold!  Great stereo!  Wish I could do something with all of the lights going on after stopping and and then fading.  Great riding in it - smooth, but a little noisy than my last Toyota.  But a lot easier to drive. A well thought out car design.","roominess in the cockpit and roominess in the back seats.  A 6'5"" man can sit in it and not touch the ceiling and have comfortable leg room",Darkening the back windows more.  
5,Economic & Roomy,Jose R. Garcia ,05/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Our car performs extremely well since the first day. We have not had to worry about the car's reliability at all. The car drives safely and smoothly. Owning this vehicle has been a pleasant experience overall.,My favorite features would be how the car is roomy on the inside yet does not require much gas. ,I would not improve anything on the car. I enjoy everything about it.
4.875,I'm so happy,DJJ ,02/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I'm from Europe and I just bought Dodge Caliber. I love it, I really do. It gives security and pleasure at same time. My family is very happy with a choice. For money, there is no better choice. I search for best car for me about 6 months, and this is by far the best on the market in segment and price range. ","Sound system is excellent, seat positions, big wheels, dashboard,","Need more space in back area for thing we must have because of law and police, chains, sign, first help box, front shield wipers are small, and parking sensors"
4.875,Fun 2 drive,megrow67 ,01/27/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great gas mileage. Comfortable, 4x2 drives great in snow better than I thought. Easy to wash. Easy to get into. Have a lot of options for the price. Get up and go to be 4 clyinder","Love the dash cooler for drinks, can't wait to use in summer. Sattalite radio. The pump up seat for tall and short people. Recharge flashlight. Fold forward passenger seat.","A lock button on passenger side. The seats are hard to put back position in rear. Should equip in all bluetooth, dash shouldn't be so wide. Rear cupholders in wrong place. Acessory port in rear. Seat belt in back hard to snap in place with car seat. but when get in no slack which is a plus. Lock glove box"
5,Awesome Caliber Review,1qwalker ,12/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I've owned my Caliber for almost five months now and I love everything about it. It's fun to drive and has a great style.,The great style and the gas mileage,Better quality window seal rubber.  Mine is turning cloudy for some reason.
4.25,Awesome for Dodge!,Robbie1 ,11/17/2008,,,5,4,3,3,,5,5,4,5,"Well, what can I say. I used to hate Dodge, but I went for a Saturday drive in my SUV and came home with my 09 Caliber SRT. The exterior looks are 100% more attractive than the standard Caliber, very aggressive features; that is what caught my eye. After taking it for a test drive, I was sold. I also own a BMW and this ""little rascal"" is more fun than driving the BMW. The suspension and steering is very tight with enough power to have some man fun! This will be my weekend entertainment.   ","Interior design is outstanding. Very nice leather package, a cockpit feel.","Dodge went a little cheap on the faux metal look for the console area. If you're looking for quiet, this car is not for you. It is a bit noisy, but the sound system will drown out all noise. "
4.5,Judge by Driving!,synesthesia ,09/16/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"Sitting inside, the headroom and line of sight is higher than most other ""little cars"".  Feels like a small SUV, mileage like a sub-compact.  The long rake of the windshield, large roof pillars and long low windows gives one the feel of sitting in an aircraft cockpit.   The engine has a lovely ""throaty roar"" to it when pushed to perform. Like no other economy car I've ever heard.   ""Smooth, Sleek and Powerful"" are the best words to describe the feel of driving this car.  I love it!  ","See this car in person. It just looks wild and wonderful compared to other ""hatchbacks""!  Take it out on the highway and give it some gas...  Listen to the sound.  Nothing like it.","The small rear window will have you looking twice when backing up, but I go forward most of the time, and this is a joy in this car."
