2,Sell it before you hit 100K!,George ,08/07/2016,,3,5,,,1,5,5,5,,,"I bought my '09 2.0T with less than 30K. Never put anything but synthetic oil and premium gas in the thing. It was a dream to drive until I started blowing ignition coils close to 80K. At around 103K it started dumping oil and coolant - so much it was embarrassing to park it anywhere. Took it to two reputable shops - they both told me it wasn't worth fixing.  I just let the thing go at 106K for $2,500 as a trade in.",,

I love this car, but within two months it has broke down on me twice to include a fuel pressure regulator and a water pump. Luckily it was certified pre owned so out of pocket costs were minimal. I take great care of this car and maintenance it myself every 5000 miles with synthetic oil and have already replaced air cleaner. Hard to enjoy the car if it will keep breaking down and im only at 55000 miles. Plenty of room in the back with 2 kids and the trunk is huge.

I was skeptical at first - somewhat odd looks, VW reputation for marginal reliability, not all the luxury I really wanted. However on test drive changed that. The 2.0L turbo engine is fantastic - quick, responsive, pulls very hard when you mash the throttle. The 6 speed transmission is mated perfectly to it and is smooth and accurate in shifts. So far, so good. I've got 36K+ miles of mostly highway driving and no breakdowns/strands/failed starts. No maintenance costs either with first 2 years covered. Some trim pieces have broken due to little kiddie fingers.I would highly recommend this car for anyone looking for an alternative to ridiculously oversized SUV","Without a doubt, the power tailgate is the best feature here.

4.625,Great Car,sconner69 ,06/25/2011,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This is the first ""new"" car we have ever bought, We purchased it in April 2010 however it was a 2009 Demo so not really brand new. Anyway it had just at 5K miles on it when we purchased and since then we have driven about 23K miles. We have had not had any mechanical issues with the car. I like others would have really liked memory seats. As I am 6'5"" and y wife is 5'6"" so we are always changing the seat. The 2.0L Turbo has amazing power and we average about 24mpg I have gotten 35mpg on the highway driving at 55 and really trying to get the best milage. Overall the car has been quite nice. ","Love the power that little 4 cylinder engine puts out. Love the auto hold feature. The stereo is very nice, the trunk is nice and roomy, and we really like the looks of this Passat. Heated seats are great, and the fit and finish is really nice, no rattles, no annoyances.
This is our 2nd Passat, the first was a TDI and we really miss the TDI fuel milage, but since both of our Passats have been great vehicles we will trade up to the 2012 TDI to get the fuel milage back.","I can think of just a few things to improve upon, buy better tires to sell on your cars VW at 27K miles ours are shot. I said it earlier, memory seats. Some sort of ""sync"" system would also be nice.
Those three things would have gotten all 5's from me. Instead VW you got three 4's in my review."

So far no unscheduled trips to the dealership, which is good. Being that this is a ""performance"" German car, you have to know it will need regular maintenance.  The engine is adequate, though not at all inspiring. Does a decent job of moving along when pushed.  Int design is very nice. Leatherette works great w/o worry of ruining it with wet beach shorts, sun damage, or regular wear and tear (look at pics of older models and seats still look new). Center tunnel is a tad narrow and would be nice if it were carpeted.  I think ext looks nicer than Passat sedan. Audi-esque front grill is great!","CD changer, iPod connection, Sirius. Like the rear hatch up/down buttons. Nice storage bins. Comfy, low maintenance leatherette seats. Sleek style. Black metallic paint. Nice wheels!","Don't like the Tokyo nightclub ""blue"" radio.

The dealer can't fix. The light interior color on areas where dirty shoes will come in contact are impossible to clean. Like lower doors and where speakers are placed which also will be damaged when someone gets in and presses there shoe to hold the door open or just scrape when getting in or out.

There are options!  This car has way more room than our neighbour's Murano and is a blast to drive!  We love manual trannys and this was the only wagon we could get one in.  We got a highline with real leather, moonroof, dual climate, satellite radio.  Had an Acura TSX before and this is quicker but gets the same mileage.  It is also quieter and smoother but the leather and aesthetics were nicer in the Acura.",Love the engine and trans.

Tech wasn't required to jot down any numbers/levels when maintenance was done!! 2 days ago was the first time any problems were noticed - grinding already...Friday serviced = $350.00 just to replace pads. I've never had to worry about brakes on any of my previous cars until well over 35k. My 2000 Passat's rear brakes were done around 50k.

I looked at all of the 2009 Models (Camry, Accord, TL, Altima, etc.), and I was sold.  The Passat has more standard features than the loaded Altima and Camry.  I have averaged over 27 mpg for the first 10k miles which were mostly highway. The gas mileage in city driving is closer to 18 because I like the turbo. This car really feels a step above its major competitors (Camry, Accord and Altima) without the extra cost of a comparably equipped model (if the competition even offers the features).

This is bigger.  Miss the mileage of the diesel. Tires are expensive because of the 17"" wheels and they are a summer thead.  Needed snow right away.

4.875,German Engineering at Japanese Pricing,skyhawk182 ,11/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Admittedly have only driven the car 6K miles, but must say, am more than pleased. Well thought out with ever so many clever features that make car seem like it knows you. Sweetest engine I've driven - excellent power due to great low end torgue via turbo charger. Rides like on rails, yet seems like larger luxury ride. One needs to keep an eye on options (can escalate pricing rapidly) and bargain aggressively - with that in mind, pricing is quite attractive and competitive.      ","Honey of an engine. Great vinyl seats that look exactly like leather (I simply KNEW that was possible, but cuts into up-charging for real leather). Cavernous interior. Lots of storage space. Serious driver layout of seating and dash. GREAT handling with high end ride. Styling sophisticated.  ","Nice audio system (10 speaker/6 CD), but could use more bass, cleaner anyway. Maybe a little more throat to the engine, but that's more me than what the public probably wants. VW recommends 10K oil changes - think that's pushing the limit.

4.625,Almost perfection,spidaman ,11/01/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,4,5," The Passat Komfort Wagon offers a wonderful balance of design, performance, comfort and safety.  We traded down from an 04 Touareg, and have not been disappointed by the fit and finish of this vehicle.  The sole Achilles Heel is the powerplant.  While peppy and enjoyable on the highway (especially when passing), there is significant turbo lag, especially compared to our other driver, a Saab 9-3 with the same size 2.0 L turbo-charged engine.  Additionally, the mileage is not nearly as good as the Saab's, and gear selection in this automatic could be better tuned.  The VW shines on design, fit and finish.  The leg well is a bit narrow, but seats are comfortable, and leads to a fine day drive.","Love the Bluetooth integration for the cell phone, and remote rear liftgate opening.  Seats are comfortable.  Very roomy storage.","Automatic transmission needs to be reprogrammed.  Not a deal breaker, but other carmakers implement this better."

5,1-month review,BK ,10/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5," Purchased on September 12th, 2009. Test drove BMW 328,335; Mercedec Benz 300, 350; Acura TL; Infiniti G37. Although all of these cars were great, I found the perfect mix of driveability and fun factor in my Passat. I only have about 750 miles on it right now and I am trying to break- in the car as gently as possible. But you can feel the surge of power when you just tap the accelerator. So far I've had no problems. VW offers a 90- day or 6K miles free check up, which I intend to to take advantage of. Since I have not taken it on a long trip, I do not have true HWY mileage; however, so far, I am averaging around 25 mpg with 60/40 Hwy/city.

4.5,Fun to drive German ,psupdx ,10/01/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,3,5," Own this car for one month. It is truly fun to drive Passat compare to other imports. Love the look inside and out. It drives like 6 cylinder car, thanks to turbo. Consequently, it consumes gas like 6 cylinder. I average 22 to 23 mi/gallon on 60 freeway/40 local. My old 2000 Maxima was better than that! I had to check the car with a local dealership for rattling noise from driver side glove box and door panel. It was fixed once and came back. So it's been at service twice for the same issue.

This car breezes down the local freeway and streets effortlessly. Handline is precise\crisp and drives rock solid like a heavier car. The only real drawback thus far is the lack of bluetooth which is optional on Passat but comes standard in other cars.

Autobahn for all, after all :-)  The exterior is to fall in love for, interior is good and minimalistic, too but the drive feel...  The steering is speed sensitive and I absolutely loved it! But... The speedometer has small numbers on it that are hard to read, so it's not clear from a quick glimpse on it whether you're making 60 or 70 km/h.  The transmission is lovely, very responsive and seamless. You really cannot feel it but the engine is unrefined.  Usually, I'm a big fan of smaller engines because of their efficiency, and almost limitless possibilities for improvement. But turbo lag kills me. Not responsive at all and jolty!!!","Dashboard, transmission, suspension.",Improve fuel economy. 2.0 litre engine drinks like a herd of horse! Thirsty!

It got great mileage and was fun to drive but not quite large enough for a growing family.  We decided on the Passat Wagon because we were in no way getting a minivan nor SUV.  We wanted the performance and handling of a car and not the bulk or stigma of a van or SUV.  It was down to the Passat or Subaru Outback.  In the end we went with the Passat as VW bank was offering 60 mos at 0%. While there may be posts out there complaining about quality, we've not seen any issues yet.  The same issues were reported for my Jetta and over 5 years, few of those issues ever arose. ",2.0 T is spunky and matched with the 6 speed auto makes for lively driving.

We love the diesels but gave up on VW ever getting the Passat diesel into North America. VW always seems to be three steps behind the marketing curve. We are quite pleased with our 2009, even though it isn't a diesel and we certainly miss that mileage. It handles beautifully but is noisier than our 2004 due to the low profile tires. We bought new tires and went one size up and the noise decreased. Our big gripe is that VW dropped Homelink from the Passat but not the Passat CC. Another braindead action by VW. Their response to my inquiry: ""Our marketing plan for North America does not include the diesel or Homelink.""",..Well designed interior ..Drive quality ..Nav system is super ..New sun shade feature,"..Need a 15"" or 16"" wheel option ..Homelink on CC but not on Passat is stupid.

After 5 days in my Lexus, it's fun to drive my wife's car on the weekend. I really can't ever say I've felt that way about my other cars. If VW can solve some of it's past reliability issues ( and it looks like they are trying hard to do so) I think middle America will 'rediscover' the brand.","tight, solid ride. Clean, teutonic look and feel. Leatherette on the wagon looks better than the real thing. Despite comments to the contrary, the 2.0T engine can use regular gas ( my friend who works for Audi let me in on that little secret since the 2.0t is borrowed from previous Audi models).",none at this point

4,TDI Bluemotion,finlander ,03/24/2009,,,4,4,4,3,,4,4,5,4,"Great mileage, super low emissions, big enough to carry lots of junk, quiet for a diesel. Acceleration leaves a lot ot be desired",The display that shows your fuel economy. Often I get as low as 58 mpg... Amazing! Dont know why this car is not available in the USA,"Vehicle low to the ground, sometimes causes problems when there is lots of snow. The start-stop system did not initially work with the car so we had to take it back for repairs. Shame, because the car is brand new"

5,Best value period,mjv ,01/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Outstanding engineering, safety, and quality.  Fantastic value.  Excellent purchase experience.  Free scheduled maintenance for 3 years.  Fun to drive.  Getting 34 mpg at 70 mph.  VW is the new BMW!","Turbo 2.0 engine, bank vault feel, audio system, seat comfort, LED brake lights, chrome grill, MPG, design and quality of interior, roominess, price, 3 yrs of free maintenance, lots of storage, rubber mats, sharp handling, quiet cabin.",Add memory seats and auto headlights to the Komfort package.  Do a 2 tone interior like the CC.

5,VW the new BMW,MVBOSTON ,01/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have a BMW X5 and traded a Merc C280 4 Matic for the Passat.  The Passat is the exact size of an E350, but half the price.  You give up rain sensing wipers, memory seats, automatic headlights and a power rear sunshade.  You get just as good build quality, similar performance in crash tests, 10 more MPG, free scheduled maintenance for 3 years, and $30,000 in your pocket.  The sales experience was much better than Mercedes.  I have no regrets. I love this car.  What will I do with my $30,000?  Good time to invest.","The turbo engine, the sound system, the hold feature, the quality and design of the interior and exterior - looks like an Audi, built in Germany by 75% German parts and a Japanese Transmission, the 6 speed tiptronic transmission, the interior and cargo space, the folding rear seats.","Grippier and quieter tires, memory seats, automatic headlights."

4.75,Traded 06 Oil Burner for 09,gluiz ,11/12/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,5,5,"So far, very few problems with 09 Passat compared to 06 previously owned.  Small rattle, ipod adapter issue dealership addressed immediately.  3200 miles driven since purchased.  Keep checking my oil to make sure don't have same issue as 06 model.  Fun to drive compared to Nissan, Honda, and Toyota family sedans.  Unfortunately, my experience is that you trade performance, fit/finish for reliability.  Keeping my fingers crossed...","ipod adapter, 2.0L engine (TSI vs. FSI), gas mileage, interior fit/finish","Please keep working at making these more reliable.  Could be a great car with a little more work.  I like my service department and all, but knowing them all on a first-name basis says a lot about reliability..."

4.375,2009 Passat Wagon - Komfort,Dan P ,11/11/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,4,5,4,"Came out of a Volvo XC70.  This car has personality and is much more fun to drive.  Comfort is good.  Good acceleration.  Mileage is better then sticker.  Easily get 30-32 at 70 mph.  33-34 at 60 mph.  Average fuel mileage is 26mpg.  Kids love the rear door window shade.  I am 6'1"" and like the front seats.  Live in area that doesn't have may Passat Wagons and get many looks.  ","Handling, great sound system, gas mileage, ergonomics are generally good.  ","Cruise control design is quirky.  Would like seat memory on drive side.  Lack of Sirius controls on steering wheel. Comfort package ok, but would like another level up.   "
