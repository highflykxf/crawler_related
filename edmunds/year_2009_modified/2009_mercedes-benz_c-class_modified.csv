3,Beware -,Peggy ,10/06/2016,3,1,1,,,1,3,3,3,,,"The car dealership advisors are all paid by commission.  They are competing to change things on your car whether it's broken or not.  I'm a woman and had the windshield wipers replaced without my authority at the first service after purchase.  I've had them scare me that I needed brake jobs ""right away"" where I waited a year and it was still fine (after checked out by other source).  I bought my car brand new with Warranty for 5 years. As soon as the 5 years passed everything started breaking down from the seat belt safety light & some SRS light with other minor malfunctions ($1500), check engine light ($2200), light bulbs and batteries are normal stuff and I won't complain about that.  Finally now, I went shopping before work and came back to find I could not start my car due to ignition switch, the care died, had to be towed and service advisor tells me it's a proprietary part (which is true - verified by another trusted source) and needs to be ordered and put in by Mercedes ($2500).          In the first 3 years of ownership, the interior began looking horrible.  The interior sliver stripping around the water holders all came out just because I used it.  The radio button black coating (with the # on it) started stripping and peeled away (1/2 black and ripped white spots all over like an old car.  I was told by the service manager it's caused by lotion on your hands.  The car seats are uncomfortable no matter how you adjust it.  Not good for a very tall or heavy person.   Think twice if you purchase this vehicle. Parts are all electrical and expensive labor. It's not like getting a Toyota or Honda fixed after warranty runs out.",,

3,Do not buy c300,Ed ,03/19/2016,,,,,,,,5,5,,,I have been having this car for three years now.

Reliability was what made this car an Mercedes Benz! However, 2009 that I own is far from reliable. 1. It always had some electrical/electronic issues since I bought every 4-5 months. 2. Road Noise is unbearable. I believe this is a car-specific problem, but Service Department refuses to sees the problem. Whoever gets into my car however, asking me what the noise is coming from.3. ""SRS Malfunction"" error message appeared out of nowhere and prevents the use of the car. Let's talk about reliability! 4. Seat is ripped from stitches when the car is only 4 years old.

The dealer said it was out of warranty and suggested calling MBNA corporate.Both the agent assigend to my case and his supervisor were rude and could not care less that this would have been covered 45 days earlier, or that it was my family's 13th Benz.I told him I would never buy another - he didn't care.At least the dealer agreed to split the repair cost.Next time Porsche!

Unfortunately, I returned the next day to the dealer ship with a fuel engine issue. The car stayed over night to get some engine part replaced. A month later, I had break lights turn on due to corrosion. Another issue was a delay with car taking off, as i would press down on the accelerator the RPM would shoot up but the car wouldnt go. I took the car several times the first year, the dealer ship wasnt able to fix a few things until i escalated the issue to the dealer ship manager at Beshoff in San jose.I have taken in my car over 15 times due to repeating problems. BMW quality is much better",I like how the Monitor screen how it flips open. I like the style of the front grill. I love the tough out appearance.,"The car performance needs major improvement:
delay when accelerating, the monitor screen should be touch screen and no joy stick, needs cool air for the seats, need to significantly reduce outside noise, GPS needs to work while driving, voice activation sucks, the bottom fog lights need to both stay on when turning...there are so many issues that a lot of improvements are needed.

I've driven and rode in many different vehicles, but the C300 is hands down the quietest, best handling, and has the most buttery smooth ride. Exterior is beautiful and flawless. I've gotten countless double-takes while driving around town, and have been complimented many times by passers by. I haven't had a single issue in a year and a half and 20,000 miles.  One gripe is the car is kind of low; I've scraped the front bumper several times on curbs, causing the black paint to scrape off, showing the white underside.","- Smooth, comfortable ride.

Examples: dual climate control cannot be controlled using driver's knob (you have to turn both), there is no trunk pass through or fold down seats, the I-pod integration stinks - almost impossible to use, actually the entire sound system is difficult to use (radio presets must be accessed through the steering controls instead of the console joystick), drivers view of the windshield wiper controls are obstructed by the steering wheel, turn signal and Cruise control stalks are in weird positions. Engine needs more power and not very responsive when you Punch it. Beautiful car but needs improvement!",My sport model looks smoking hot. Fit and finish is excellent. Ride is smooth and controlled. Interior feels luxurious (tan with burled walnut is sweet). Engine has good power but is not always responsive when you need it.,"BMW 3-series performance blows this car away.  Interior controls are terrible and need a complete redesign.  This is 2010, the Ipod should work seamlessly.

Made only minor adjustments to my ratings to up the rating for exterior styling and reliability.  Car has been bulletproof; has been in the dealership only for routine service and one damaged tire.  The car isn't particularly exciting but it has a certain intangible quality.  Like an expensive suit, I feel like a better person when I drive this car.  The ride in the sport model is perfect and I like the steering feel.  The car is exceptionally smooth and quiet, and the seats, while firm, are extremely comfortable on long drives.  MB-TEX is an asset... not an ounce of wear, which you can't say about leather.  I want a new E Class!","Value.  The base stereo sounds fine, and you'll get a better GPS by buying a portable one, so don't buy the MM package (but do buy P1).  AWD was great in winter.  Car feels like it will last forever, but I only have it for two more years.",I STILL confuse cruise control stalk for turn signal sometimes.  iPod interface will not shuffle custom play lists; a major annoyance.  Gas mileage just OK for a car of this size.  Wheels hard to clean.  SIRIUS satellite reception is weak and sometimes hunts for signal on clear days.  Noisy fan.

First of all i want to list all the good things about this car.  The exterior is perfect in every way.  The interior with the exception of the cruise control lever is designed very well.  I do enjoy the fact that everything has worked like a charm without one problem...well done.  Now for the bad.  The seats are downright uncomfortable in every way.  Too hard and cramped.  The steering is just plain boring and unattached to the road.  The car is just not fun to drive.  I feel i should just buy a Honda next time and forget it if i want reliable and boring.  A good car but not what i expect.,Features and quality.  Engine is great as well as transmission.  NO problems and that says alot to the quality improvements,Steering feel needs new seat design.

Granted only driven it 3000 miles but have had absolutely no issues at all(other than the signal lever/cruise lever are too close together).

I like the more aggressive look of the C350 as compared to my Lexus, and that was the main draw as I knew I'd be giving up a bit in terms of comfort (Lexus has much softer leather and seats, and somewhat smoother ride) and horsepower (IS350 306hp v. C350 268hp).  The C350 offers a more engaging driving experience (falls between the IS350 and 3-Series). My Lexus was overly smooth which took the ""sport"" out of sport sedan. Despite 38hp less in the C350, it's more fun to drive than the Lexus and acceleration is more than adequate to get ahead of traffic.","Sound system is excellent (much more bass and 150 more watts than Lexus Mark Levinson), navigation, fit and finish, styling, handling, ride comfort. Despite complaints about rear seat legroom and trunk space, it has more than the IS350, and I can now fit average size adults in the back seats.","*Leather is underwhelming compared to the softer Lexus leather. *Missing Keyless Entry and Push Button start/stop and rear view camera my Lexus had. *When searching POIs by name, they aren't listed in order of proximity to current location, but in alphabetical order by state."

My two major gripes are the brakes and power.  I do 70% freeway driving and at 65 mph, this motor has limited passing ability.  Punch it and it makes a lot of noise, but takes an hour to get around a big rig, especially on an uphill grade. I guess it depends on what you're used to. Additionally, the car is 'underbraked'.

Then carefully planned a new purchase after having tried many similar size, entry level, luxury sedans, both German and Japanese. Went for the Mercedes for its optimal combination of smooth ride quality, plenty of power (last Honda was around 140 hp), quality built, and of course the looks.  Mine came manual (still love the thrill of shifting gears), with all the ""high end packages"", so came to about 42,000 $, pretty similar to other cars in that category.  So far driven it for a week, with a good combo of city and highway mileage, and love it. And any manual car only gets better with time! ","Ride, manual transmission, looks inside and out, navigation.",Little more interior storage space would be useful. Had trouble automatically loading phone numbers from my cell phone into the bluetooth telephone in the car.
