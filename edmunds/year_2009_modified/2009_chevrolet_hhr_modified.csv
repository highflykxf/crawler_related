5,2009 HHR - My Pride and Joy,HHR owner ,10/16/2016,5,5,4,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I bought this car with 30,000 miles for $7500. It now has 279,000 miles and the only reason why I have to put her down is because it has been hit at least 7 different times since I own her. The first time the door was hit by someone pulling of their driveway. The back truck door was hit by a car sliding in snow. The left side was hit at least three times because I had her parked at a corner. The right left side was hit on the top, not sure how that one happen. The last one was the left side of the passage door was hit by someone who decided to run a stop sign. I drove this car from Trenton NJ to the Bronx 6 days a week, and she always came through for me. It was a true wonder. I took her when there was a recall by Chevy, for the ignition problem but she manage to get through that. Though she was not the best looking car out there she continue to ride better than any other car. I never fixed the dents and continue to ride her as is until the last hit. The insurance company because of the damage ""totaled her."" In all the years that I have driven cars I have never had one as loyal and reliable as this one. I have had two Camarys and they could not even come close. I am currently looking for another HHR. Chevy did right by me when they made this one.",,
2,Don't buy this car,Linda sheppard ,07/26/2016,,,2,,,,2,2,2,,,"I have  lt2 large engine.  I bought it with 9000 miles on it.  The first year I had new struts installed. New catalitic converter, in shop now to have sensor replaced. The thing that shows tire pressure doesn't work.  Cannot keep pressure in right front tire.  This year alone I have spent one thousand dollars.  Will trade it very soon.  Beware.  It rides very rough, like a truck without shocks.  Very hard on tires.  Lots of road noise.  I hate this car. In my 76 years I've never had but one other car as bad and it was a 2981 Chevy t top Monte Carlo.  No more Chevys for me.",,
4,Good vehicle for short or long trips,Julana ,05/12/2016,4,3,4,,,5,4,5,4,,,"Have had this vehicle since 2010 and has been a very good vehicle, it travels very well and is roomy for storage, hauling things in the back and people sitting in front and back.  The only thing about an HHR is when you open the windows just a little bit in the back, you get a rumbling sound like big truck sounds, but other than that, it is a great vehicle.",,

1,Worst car ever!,Jennifer O ,10/21/2015,1,1,3,,,1,1,1,3,,,"This car has been a complete disappointment and frustration to me since day one.... I bought it used from a reputable dealer with approx. 53,000 miles. It had clean Carfax. I am a seasoned driver and drive very carefully. My car has never been involved in any accidents, floods, or serious storms as long as I have been its owner. In the 3 years I have owned it, I have had to replace the ignition cylinder (because my car wouldn't turn off), the fuse block, the BCM, the control arm- twice, the power steering motor, and the front passenger window motor. I had to have the entire electrical system re-wired. Both before and after replacing all the wiring, the ""service airbag"" icon and message have remained on constantly. Frequently, the front passenger seatbelt locks-up inside the car wall near the door, making it impossible for anyone to pull it out and fasten it to sit in the front passenger seat. I have had to replace the brakes- 3 times. I have had to purchase 5 tires in the past 3 months because it keeps coming out of alignment. I spent almost $1500 3 days ago replacing my shocks & struts, welding a crack in my exhaust, once again fixing the control arm, repairing an oil leak, and replacing spark plugs and seals ruined by the oil leak. Yesterday as I was driving to work, the ""service ESC"" light and ""reduced traction"" message appeared and never turned off. Today, the check engine icon and a ""reduced power"" message came on, while the car sputtered, lurching forward and then almost dying, then lurching, then nearly dying, in a never ending cycle. I am upside down by nearly $7000 as literally all of my savings and that of my loved ones has gone into the neverending, constant stream of repairs. It won't stop. Every time I turn around something new- serious and expensive- is wrong. It is the worst car I have ever owned in my life. I would not recommend this car to my worst enemy, and I don't feel safe driving it. I would junk it the first chance I have, but it's the only car I have, and I'll be paying for it for another 2 1/2 years- IF it makes it that long. Just the WORST!!",,
4.25,Key Stuck Problems,kingshahid ,08/01/2012,,,4,5,4,4,,4,5,4,4,"I bought this car in April 2012. My battery died and so I called GM. GM boosted the car with their roadside assistance resulting in a stiff steering wheel that couldn't be turned. My keys got stuck in the ignition as well. Both problems where resolved but my auto starter (oem) was blown in the process that was not fixed by local Chevrolet Bob Myers. So I had let the issue go with them since I thought they had done enough for me. 2 weeks later (mind you I barely drove the car in this period) the keys are stuck again in the car. Car is at 88,000 km.","Exterior appeal, big chevrolet signature steering wheel, quick pick up speed, large trunk area, comfortable drive interior feel.",Keys get stuck in ignition
3.625,LT 2.4 auto,monkfarm ,10/30/2011,,,2,4,4,5,,3,3,5,3,"I bought my HHR 2.4 LT at 8100 miles.I am a spirited driver.The suspension is antiquated.Look under the rear and discover the solid axle.(I have had 3 bmws).That said, the car starts well and is dependable, and is a good solid car for hauling my wife and 4 dogs. (the back seat folds down.)There is not enough storage in the front and the front corner of the dash tends to bother my knee on long trips.The drivers seat isn't bad, but could be improved. The dimmer switch seems to make the headlights disappear for a microsecond which is irritating. The torque steer when you really stomp on it is pronounced.This car is pretty good on long trips and doesn't handle badly.I enjoy it","The styling I like.
I do like the room in the car with the back seat folded down.
The fog-lights and headlights seem to put a good pattern on the side of the road.
 The 2.4 seems to have adequate power.
I like that I can shut off the daytime running lights with the switch.
The heater and air-conditioner are great.
(I was in oklahoma this august with 120 degree weather and it kept up. ) The steering is good, and the car works steering through heavy traffic at high speeds.
I like the flex fuel feature.
Car is relatively easy to change oil.
The car always starts no matter how cold (wisconsin).
I have 37000 now. ","More storage in front, different design on the dash (hard on the right knee).
I like the dash on my former 379 Peterbilt, flat, all the gauges, simple but elegant.
It would be beautiful with turned aluminum.
Gorgeous on this car and cheap to build.
I get some brake noise, and I am not in love with the brakes,
(just barely adequate).
I mentioned torque steer before (the tendency of the car to wander under acceleration).
This is pronounced with this car, really surprising wandering that you must stay on top of when even passing maneuvers call for massive acceleration. Stock lug bolts are cheap (kinda scary), I had to replace 3 already (stripped out).
Better fuel economy would be nice."
3.5,Thank God for a good dealership,1badstroker ,08/08/2011,,,3,3,3,3,,4,4,4,4,Bought my 2009 HHr in 4/10 and it has had more problems that all my cars I owned in 40 plus years. The pass. side power windows quit after about 4 weeks of ownership and the drivers side front and rear floors were wet. This water caused the wires to corrode and the ecm to go out which caused the windows to get no power. The dealer fixed this under good will. Then after that the dealer fixed another short and then after a time the key would not come out of the ignition. The dealer replaced the shifter and the ignition switch and that has corrected the problem. Since then Ihad to replace the battery andfront brakes. All good now. ,Fuel milage,Get rid of so much plastic and pay alittle more attention to quality.
3,Not looking forward to warranty running out,b0ds ,05/26/2011,,,3,4,2,2,,3,3,4,3,"My wife and I purchased this car new back in '09.It's good on gas and not too bad for road trips.A taller person like myself might find themselves hunched over to see out the windshield though.The ignition went bad within the first year.One day we just couldn't turn the car off, the ignition had locked up and you couldnt turn the key to shut it off.Had to pull the fuel pump fuse to kill the car.We've had to have the brake rotors and pads replaced a couple times.Most recently we had to replace a leaking front strut.All this before the car reached 27k miles.Havnt had to pay for repairs, but the warranty ends soon.I would not purchase another one.",,

4.875,What a Blast!,Tim ,10/29/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this car, used from a dealer about 2 hrs from my home. It was the closest HHR with all the things I wanted in it. It has been Great since day 1. I drive from NC to NY every 2 weeks for work and it is a pleasure to drive.I get about 28-29 mpg while cruising at about 75 mph.My dog rides in the back and is very comfortable or so he says.It gets a lot of looks but more often than not, people don't know what kind of car it is.I think that's changing because I see a lot more of them on the road these days.I know mine will be on I-95 for a long time to come.","Exterior looks, comfort, fuel economy and fun to drive.",They should make the door locks flush with the door so you could rest your arm w/o it sticking into you.

4.75,Amazing Multipurpose Vehicle,max solano ,10/11/2010,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"This started as my Monday through Friday vehicle. In the 18 months, and 65,000 miles I have owned it, it has become my weekend car as well. The sports car and the truck have been relegated to the back of the driveway. This HHR SS serves as a daily driver and a weekend hauler. Great acceleration and great gas mileage if you stay out of the turbo's maximum boost. Noisy cabin at speed and entirely too much plastic used in the interior, but still FUN to drive. Have only had one issue with the clutch slave cylinder, but Chevy covered the repair under warranty. Other than that,the vehicle has only had oil and filter changes. Changed out the Michelin tires at 45k miles, Conti's have improved ride.","Pro's - Acceleration, very good MPG, loads of passing power under load, and cargo versatility. Upgraded stereo with XM is excellent. Just hang on until you get accustomed to the torque steer.It is a surprise the first few times you go hard on the right hand pedal.Seems like a great buy at $24k.",The cruise control needs a cancel button. Needs higher quality interior materials. The door lock nob is sharp and is set where your arm rests on a windows down day.The sunroof wind deflector is noisy and aftermarket deflector is not available.
4.625,BRAKES,crybabby ,10/06/2010,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Just got it and the brakes squeak.  It seems like it may be a problem.  I am not the only one with it.  And it's funny it happened after i bought it, not on the test drive.  Didn't like the car when saw it, but after driving it and getting used to all the blind spots I fell in love.  If you are going to get on the hwy. Turn ac off, You will get more power pick up.  Oh yeah, cup holders, what were they thinking. ","Gas mileage, safety, I feel safe in this car when i have kids in it.  That is a plus.  And my warranty.  But that doesn't include brakes.  Bummer",Fix brake problem.

Fuel mileage is not terrific (18-21 on E85)(45 with my vw bug diesel), but well built, and handles well with proper tire inflation.  Light switch has odd quirk (goes off when bright to dim and dim to bright for split second). Torque steer when accelerating is startling (hang on). I like the storage in the middle of the dash, but not a whole lot of storage around the driver is available.   The small windshield takes a little getting used to. I wish the adjustment on the steering wheel was greater.This car would be great with a dash like a Peterbilt (straight dash with lots of gauges).

Actually, I purchased this with my wife's impending need to upgrade her Prism (8 yrs old). We make daily trips of 40 miles, often hauling miscellaneous things such as feed bags, plantings and assorted small gardening equipment.  The route is on both paved and unpaved roads.  This car (?) is a perfect fit of utility and grace.  The litmus test: my wife now drives this 100%!  ;) That outcome means we will purchase another - literally - because as expected, the Prism has seen the end of trails.

I reluctantly take it for a test spin.  Its really not like an SUV, but its fun to drive like an old school VW camper van.  Chrome wheels, 2.4L engine, sunroof, remote start, great XM radio, configurable seating, room for my dogs. Its really fun to drive.  Bought it a week ago, and really love the ride.","Smooth engine, traction control, XM radio, power sunroof, chrome wheels, hidden compartment for your nav, crazy amount of cargo space in a vehicle that takes up very little garage space.

I am still getting used to the style, but so far, I like it.","The floor of the trunk can be raised so that you have storage under and over the trunk floor, for much added space.  The traction control and ABS brakes give me security when driving in snow and ice.  I like the fact that I sit high, like a minivan.","The trunk hatch should raise up higher.

I can not believe how much stuff I can haul in he cargo area!  This car is so fun to drive and beats out the van on cargo space and gas mileage.  We did have to get a new battery installed within a few days of buying it but we did buy it used so I can't complain to loudly on that.  It was still under warranty so we didn't have to pay.

I drive in heavy stop and go traffic daily, but have improved my gas mileage by more than a third.  My only complaint- the basic stereo!

They claim that the microphone bug in car will not be turned unless the air bag is deployed, and being able to track the car's location within 90 feet (only if a stolen police report is filed, they claim) leaves much to be desired.  Is it possible that someone could payoff an Onstar Employee to track or turn on the onboard mike without drivers knowledge.  I believe so.  Per Chevy dealer I have disconnected the mike and 4 of the 5 plug ins to Onstar box.  One needed to start car, but can the vehicle still be tracked?","Clean design of dash layout, not like many others with cheap looking silver and shiny plastic. Smooth ride.  Decent acceleration.

I took it on a 3 hour trip and found it to be every bit as comfortable as the Lexus.  I also have a business, and the HHR's cargo capacity is what I was really searching for.

I do estimates for my business and wanted something with better mileage. I decided on the Chevy HHR LT2 because of its looks, driveability, features, comfort. I have been pleasantly surprised by its quite comfortable ride and great gas millage. This vehicle will almost pay for itself in fuel savings alone, The radio with 7 Alpine speakers sounds great. So far I love the HHR and glad I picked it over its competition.  ","Great sound system with 7 Alpine speakers,Sunroof, 17"" aluminum wheels, leather seating,seats fold down flat including front passenger seat, smooth ride, good handling, great gas mileage, remote start feature, great quality from an American company.  ",Visibility could be better hard to see traffic lights with low roof. No built in garage door button. 
5,Fast little truck,E.  LINDROS MARTUCCI ,10/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I really love this 2009 truck. I drive it daily to my home in Lake Wallenpaupack Pennsylvania and get about 27 miles per gallon highway. There is ample cargo room for a family of four and the stopping power is good due to the 4 wheel Brembo disc brakes. I have customized the exterior with chrome accents to give the truck a custom appearance. Test drive one and you will be hooked.,Great cornering ability. Great mileage. Fast little machine with the turbo,The only improvement needed would be a better back lumbar support which comes as original equipment.
4.875,Nice car,bruce ,09/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,I had 520 miles on my 09 HHR when we left on a trip to Denver NC via Norton VA. It was pretty well loaded down with luggage etc. Lots of steep hills to get to Norton but it pulled them very well. no problems with the brakes either except the pedal does feel soft. Coming back to Ohio thru the Blue Ridge on I77 it ran great with the cruise set at 70. For the trip I averaged 29.2 mpg and it was a comfortable ride. You do have to know how to set and use the outside mirrors as there are blind spots.,I love the body style and the cargo room. ,Put a coast or cancel button on the cruise so you don't have to keep tapping the brake pedal to disengage it.
