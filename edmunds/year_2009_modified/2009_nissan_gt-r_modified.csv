5,Automotive orgasm,Robert ,07/14/2016,5,5,4,,,5,5,5,4,,,"I have had my GTR for 4 months. There is an unnamed river road that is windy, twisty and has dips. There are even a few straight lines. This road brings out the best in this vehicle. It will stick like glue, easily handling anything I can dish out. Amazing! It is also my daily driver. Taking off slowly in first was initially unsettling, but you get used to it. Excellent sound system.A car like this was a dream for me. I'm really a Porsche guy, but the price of a late model turbo is out of my reach. But the GTR is the finest performance machine I've ever driven.",,
5,Awesome,Tony Leparulo ,11/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Had a lot of fast cars but none as fun. This package beats all. The car on the track is sick. you can't find, it's limit. It is the car of the decade. No one give you the performance of this car for the price nothing corners like it. the only car that even comes close is the Lexus. There taking orders now for $375, Sold my Porsche Carrera.","every thing.    The g meters it is great to see your g force, and see on a display","the over spill when filling tank, doesn't always happen looks like when you get too low it burbs fill up at the half way mark , no problem"
4.5,this is the car,g4real ,11/02/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,3,4,5,"As of this time, I put in 5,800 miles on this car & all I can say is it's worth every penny. Style of this car & the limited delivery from japan is a advantage for the consumer. a lot of head turning is going to happen once you owe this gtr. performance, can't complain. it has the power and speed that every man would want to have on a sports car. traded my sl55 amg for this & it was worth. only down side is rough & bouncy suspension. But other than that it's perfect. I wish they had a manual. Never used the launch control since it scares me already having this fast of a vehicle. took it to vegas & ran up to 160mph without a problem. i will give the gtr a 9/10 rating.","navigation, speed, descent gas mileage on the freeway","6 disc cd changer, manual transmission."
5,Phenomenal Rocket Ship with Amentities,Simone ,09/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"If anyone out there is considering a purchase of a Nissan GTR, do yourself a favor and buy it now.  No other car has the performance, suspension, technology and safety out there for the money.  I'm not into being followed by others wanting to take pics of the car but this car really has rock star status.  I cant ever go to the gas station without someone coming up and wanting to gaze or gawk at the car.  I've had it now for about six months &I have no gripes.  This thing is just an absolute awesome experience to drive &it performs on the track (both 1/4 mile and autocross) beautifully.  Simply put, the best car I've ever owned and I did test drive the M3, M5 AMG SL63 and Z06 before buying.",Favorite feature is definitely stepping all the way down on the gas pedal on watching the car pull 1G and hitting 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds.,The only improvement I would suggest is to put a back-up camera as standard equipment.  I had an aftermarket cam installed by a stereo shop and it works perfectly but this should be standard issue.
4.75,Best car I've ever driven ,bigmclargehuge ,09/15/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"It's the complete package.  Performance, handling, and comfort.  No car I have driven is a better combination.  Interior is high quality and seats are comfortable.  Comfort mode does help the harsh ride, though I like the solid stance in R-mode around corners.   Shifts when you want it to, unlike many auto/manuals.  Always ready to follow your instruction.   An excellent long-distance cruiser or boulevard blaster!  ",This car corners like it is on rails.  Very flat and stable.  The grip is incredible.   There's more power and torque than you know what to do with.  Normal acceleration is effortless.  ,"Low-speed shift action is jerky.  Very low ground clearance.   FYI, in response to a previous poster; lowering the car 2"" would cause it to sit on terra firma. Realistically, car could benefit from speed hump height adjustment like on other supercars."
4.75,great car,peter ,06/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"this car is everything that I wanted in a car.  There are a few things that can be improve like fuel economy.  I am getting about 15 miles per gallon and that is driving at normal speed, going fast maybe about 11 miles per gallon. When starting the car in the manual mode the car transmission sometimes stalls for a fraction of a second because the transmission is calculating the gears. ","The stereo system is great but tI bet the looks ion this car are the best features.  I had people following me just to take a photo of this car. Last week a policeman stopped me just to ask me what kind of car I was driving.  I never got that with a Porsche, Benz, BMW. Great looks!","More space in the back seats, If I move my seat to the front to let someone sit behind me I am on top of the wheel. Not to bad in the passenger side."
4,Disappointed,RevMatt ,05/31/2009,,,4,3,5,5,,4,4,3,4,"Too heavy, too hyped and too limited.  Nicely conceived, poorly executed.  Drop 600-700 lbs, lower two inches, get rid of the fancy tranny and eliminate the ""warranty voided if you use the launch control"" and this car could be a world class sports car!  The AWD needs some work to improve driver feedback.  I sold my GT-R in favor of a Corvette Z06.  Nissan developed some great ideas but missed the mark.",Great performance for the money! Unique styling!,"Drop 600-700 lbs, drop the fancy tranny in favor of a manual 6-7 speed.  Lower the car 2 inches.  Improve driver feedback feel through the AWD."
5,Value+,JMarcinkevich ,04/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Nothing compares to this vehicle. You cannot beat it for the dollars, almost nothing can beat it's performance, the fit and finish work very well at this price point, and it does not need to make a lot of noise to get the job done or attract attention. Looks certainly do attract attention, it is different, not for that purpose, but to again get the job done! It's the aero efficiency, the 2+2 ability, and real trunk space. The numbers are widely known, why would an informed, intelligent, and cost conscious consumer buy anything else?",Everything it has!!!,"Back up camera, radar/proximity braking, for those moments of sheer bliss, (I.E.) when distracted by that lovely passenger in the other seat (or kids in the back)!!"
4.625,Disorientingly Fast!,Nate ,03/31/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I only have 117 miles on the car so far, but what I can say is that it is really an experience.  I purchase the car for a daily driver in Wisconsin.  The ride is not that harsh, the gear box is a MANUAL for all intense purposes and the shifts feel like a good manual transmission would feel.  There is a little too much road noise for my personal taste. ","Engine, BACK SEATS! (good enough for two car seats for the kids!), and price!","Two different treatments on the premium level...a ""track version"" and a ""street version.""  That way, you could keep both the daily drivers and the weekend track guys happy at the same time!"
4.125,"Great, but a little passionless",Shawn ,02/25/2009,,,4,2,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"The GT-R is without doubt an amazing feat of engineering.  That said, I'm not sure I love it.  I've had an S2000 for four years, and like a previous reviewer I really think it is more fun to drive.  Whereas the S2000 is a fun little partner in petty 'crime', the GT-R is more akin to a nuclear weapon.  I know it's unbelievably powerful and fast, but I also get very little chance to use it on the street in a way that seems 'fun.'  But that's a knock against any supercar.  So, while I greatly respect the GT-R, I don't really lust after it, in part because it does not look good.",Engine.  Tranny in paddle/manual shift mode.  Brakes.  Awesome multi-parameter electronic instrumentation,"Automatic shifting mode should be smoother.  Car is too heavy, and feels that way."
5,THE modern era supercar!,Manraj S Dhillon ,02/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I researched this car for over a year against BMW M3, Mercedes C63 AMG, Audi RS4, Corvette Z06 and I was coming from a WRX STi and I kid you not, this car does it all. I had heard that it had a hard ride and was noisy but it is not the case. It handles beautifully and turns immediately when you want it to.The power is indescribable and the sound of the car, in my opinion, is just right (V8s are overrated). The interior is quality crafted and it has all the modern tech you could need or want. Do not buy if you need usable rear seats. It does better MPG than my STi did and the sound system is great. You had also better get used to the attention you will receive because they are so rare. The BEST","The shape, interior, fit and finish, performance, performance, performance!",none.
4.75,Godzilla worth the wait,Brian ,12/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"After ordering my car in January, it finally arrived in late October.  It was everything I expected and then some. The build quality is excellent, and the comfort and interior design are actually quite good for a supercar built at this price.  Bang for the buck can not be matched.  The only thing I would change would be to tune the exhaust.  It is nice at low RPM, but almost disappears at speed.  I don't want anything obnoxious, just some suggestion as to what the car can do. Oh well, I guess that fits in with the stealthiness of the car in general.",Engine and transmission,Exhaust note at higher RPM
5,Best in the market ,quen ,12/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Test drove every single car in 70-80k price range and this was the best. Great for long trips as well as everyday use.,"Rims, HP, the steptronic is really accurate, mpg is not that bad for the performance - 23 mpg. ",Wanted a convertible.
4.375,GT-R will GeTcha!!,GlennO ,11/11/2008,,,5,4,5,4,,5,4,3,5,"The earlier reviews cover most of the salient points, so I will comment, with a perspective as a mechanic and former SCCA racer, and to correct a couple of errors in the other reviews. First, not only is there an outside temperature gauge, but one can set an auto or manual temp at which the dash display will warn you of icy conditions. My main gripe is that doing one's own service is a challenge on this car. The underside makes it hard to get at the mechanicals, and the owner's manual is useless for the DIY'er - it reads like a BMW manual. Parts will be very expensive, as every fluid is ""special"" and costly. But the car gets better the more miles I put on it, and it IS a super car, for sure!","Engine responsiveness and power. Controls easy to follow once you get used to them - no i-Drive complaints from me. Ride is surprisingly good over most road surfaces in Comfort mode, and the paddle shift controls feel/function perfectly. This car is very easy to drive at high speeds - great brakes.","Make the manual more hands-on friendly for those of us who are experienced with car maintenance. I am forced to pay hundreds of dollars more to purchase a service DVD - at this price, that should be a no-cost option. ""Launch"" mode will likely void the warranty, and the GT-R has elect. spy circuitry. "
4.125,Godzilla invades USA!,Road Rage ,10/21/2008,,,5,3,5,5,,5,4,2,4,"Technology is amazing on this car - almost over the top, but when you add it all up, this car flat out delivers. Engine is phenomenal, with gobs of power and a flat torque curve. The two small IHI turbos spool up very quickly, so the car feels more like a V-8 than a juiced six. The DCT shifts smoothly in norm and comfort modes, and bangs swift and hard in race mode. Note I downrated the ""fun to drive"" category because this car is deadly serious, and one has to be very attentive to the power and the braking, both of which are amazing. My S2000 was more fun to drive, but I do not regret buying the GT-R one bit. It gets a lot of attention everywhere I go, and I like stealth, but I am happy.","Minimal turbo lag, super attention to detail, especially leather dash and door bits. Braking is stunning - I have to run red lights in fear that no other car behind me can stop as quickly as I can. Build quality is very good. Underside of car is completely sealed to reduce drag, which at .27 is low.","Styling is OK, far better than the giant cockroach ""Z"", but few of the lines could be called graceful. It is strictly form and function in the GT- R. I am a hands-on owner, and do not like the ""hands-off"" owner's manual. They seem to point all service to the dealer - I'll have to buy the $ tech man'l"
4.625,Meets and Exceeds Expectations,lvgtr ,09/30/2008,,,5,4,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just received my GTR.  It's always a risk to purchase based on hype, rumours and reviews but not being able to test-drive.   However, this car exceeded my expectations and is incredibly fun to drive.  Of course the power is there and I expected it.  What I didn't expect is the awesome double clutched auto-manual transmission.  It shifts so quickly and precisely!  Only problems so far are passenger door not aligned to close properly and some kind of problem with the bluetooth calling numbers without my knowledge (kind of embarrassing). Overall, a historic and great car. Engineering marvel.",Transmission.  Launch control. Obviously the twin turbos!,Door handles are awkward. No outside temp display.  Interface to satellite radio stations could be improved. rear-view reverse camera would be helpful.
4,Only the transmission,tokyogtr ,08/15/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,1,2,5,"Had the car for 5 months now with 11000 km.  Transmission started to make severe mechanical noise, couldn't shift from 1st to 2nd.  The dealer transplanted a new transmission... I still love the car, enjoy the acceleration and cornering. If not for the transmission, it's a reliable car on every aspect.  When you can beat Porsche Turbo at about 1/3 the price, I couldn't complain. ",,
