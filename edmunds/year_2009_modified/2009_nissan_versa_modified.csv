4,lightly driven.,Joe P ,10/13/2016,4,3,3,,,4,3,4,3,,,"I got this car as a spare in the 2009 cash for clunkers. drove it just now and then.  I started driving it every day, 2 month ago, 20k miles on it.  My thoughts are that my base model came with no arm rests, luckily after market ones are easy to get. Also, the electronic steering wheel causes constant interference on the aftermarket AM radio. The worst thing about this car is the front wheels are so far out in front, that there is no weight on them,  trying to accelerate into traffic causes tire spin even on dry roads, almost impossible to pull out into traffic on wet roads. I am still on factory tires so this might get better if better tires are eventually installed.",,

3,Engine literally FELL out of car driving  35 mph,Leslie W ,09/21/2016,3,3,3,,,1,1,3,3,,,"The CVT transmission went out around 96k. No problems until then. Warranty was extended and transmission fixed.  However, approximately 10k miles after transmission was fixed, the engine literally fell out of the car while I was driving down a side road, hanging 2 inches off the ground.  Neither corporate nor the dealership who originally repaired the car wouls take responsibility.  Either a mechanic made an error putting the engine back in, or Nissan is making such cheap cars, your engine may fall out when you hit a pot hole.  Very dangerous! What a horrible thing to do to a customer. I'll never buy Nissan again.",,

We bought it in Georgia (brand new) and now live in Ohio, so we've had the car in extremes of weather. We've used it to move, to drive people around town, for work, and for play. I had to replace the air conditioning compressor this summer, and just had the exhaust system redone. But those have been the only big items maintenance-wise. I love my Versa!",,

4,Nifty car with many luxury features one weakness,Randolph Selig ,03/23/2016,4,5,4,,,3,5,4,4,,,"If the fuel pump has not already been replaced, it may have to be.  It's an expensive job. This is a known vice in this model yet Nissan has not issued a TSB.That aside, this is a great small car: well designed with plenty of interior space, comfortable back seat, good brakes and steering, smooth shifting 4-speed automatic trans, adequate power and pickup though the smooth idling engine gets noisy under hard acceleration.The ride is about average for a shortish wheelbase car.  Unfortunately there are only warning lights for engine temperature and amps.  The sharply sloping hood is hard to see the end of which at the start can complicate parking.  The model I purchased has power windows and door locks and a keyless entry though to start the car the coded key is needed.",,

4,So Far So Good,Pat ,01/18/2016,4,3,4,,,4,4,3,4,,,"Car is now 7 years old w/65k miles. Purchased one year ago from an elderly family member who bought it new. Versa reliability a mixed bag from what I've read. I'm more into Toyota quality but this car came available at a great price. So far no major issues. Had to change out one strut. Still on the original set of brakes. Seems to be easy on tires. Averages about 30 MPG. Drives out pretty good. No speed demon but adequate. My impression is this is a decent economy car that does everything well. Time will tell if it lasts.Pros: Great visibility, decent MPG, fold down rear seats. Cons: Electronic steering, jittery on the highway, engine noisy when pushed.",,

4,Still going strong.,essdee ,10/14/2014,4,,5,,,4,,4,4,,,"We bought the Versa in 2009 in the cash for clunkers program in exchange for an AWD Toyota Previa (which had served us very well for 18 years and 225,000 miles) and have done about 48,000 varied miles in the Nissan.  It has been reliable , pretty economical, easy to park in little spaces, a good load carrier and enjoyable to drive.  Interior space is generous and the seats are very comfortable but the stowage space around the driver is a bit limited and there is not really anywhere to rest your elbows.  Overall build quality is high but the plastic around the heater controls has started to rot.  I also find the blue ""cold engine"" warning light unnecessary and at night easy to confuse with high beam.After a coast to coast cross country trip later, still happy with the vehicle though I read some worrying reviews of the safety of the sedan version (mine is a hatchback).  It still has the original tires and battery.  However, at around 43000 miles a big piece of the air conditioning system tucked away behind the dash needed a $600 repair, and from reading online forums it seems to have been quite a common problem.",,

4,My 2009 has been great,rock2014 ,09/21/2014,5,3,4,,,5,4,3,4,,,"I bought this car new - actually right off the truck - in 2009. For the first six years I drove 100 miles round trip to work each day, and now have about 172,000 miles. For the past year I've lived just 1.5 miles from work, so the car is getting fewer miles. It has needed nothing but routine maintenance - because I baby it, we're still on the original brakes.My wife and two daughters preferred traveling in this instead of our Ford Taurus - more roomy, especially in the back.Bottom line - especially if you're looking for what Edmunds calls a reliable ""appliance"" car, I've never had anything better than this.",,

It is sickening to think when I am driving that such a poor quality product is considered acceptable by Nissan.

3,Sad to post...,jasonmontreal ,02/08/2013,,,4,4,1,1,,3,5,3,3,"For 50,000 km (about 30,000 miles) my Versa was perfect. Then one day the problems started....1) Car started to make diesel-like noise every time I accelerated. I took it to the dealer and they informed me there was a crack in the pistons. Result=a new engine at 50,000 km2) Air conditioning pump failed about 5,000 km later. Dealer repaired under warranty3) The final draw was this week, when the car wouldn't start and left me stranded in a parking lot at night. I had the car towed to the dealer where I learned that the fuel pump was finished. As the car is out of warranty, repairs were $700I signed for a Toyota Corolla yesterday, and I feel like a huge weight has been lifted. ","This is a very comfortable car to drive, with nice seats and tons of rear leg room. The stereo and air conditioning (when it works) are also excellent. The car also offers a lot of cargo room when the rear seats are folded flat. The manual transmission is nice to operate, and the car is very quiet on the highway. ","Before I begin, I fully understand that lemons exist in the auto industry and that I very well may have a lemon. However:

1) Build quality. These cars are particularly not suitable to Canadian winters. They are built for freeway driving in Orange County. The paint scratches very easily and the interior is rickety when you drive over potholes 

2) Reliability (see review section). The 14 year-old Mazda I replaced with this vehicle is still going strong, while the Versa is practically falling apart

3) Fuel economy is very sub-par for the category. On average, the car gets about 9.5L/100 km (22mpg)

If you're in the market for a small hatchback, I suggest looking at Honda, Toyota or Mazda. "

4.875,Economic Car Great for a College student ,seunghyeon00 ,11/28/2012,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,First of all if your looking for a reliable car with great room interior AND small yet not feeling crushed in this is the car for you. I got this car from my parents in high school and I have been driving it ever since. I had it since 09 and no problems I take it to the dealer to get it serviced and my baby has not let me down.,What I really like is the space. I am a big guy and really didn't want an SUV because its too much gas. WELL THIS CAR does the job.,Some improvements would be some integration of GPS and find a way to make the car a little faster.

For such a small car with a small engine I expected better gas mileage. Driving about 75 mph on the highway gets me about 27 mpg.

This car is incredibly safe and comfortable! As soon as I found it was totaled I told my mom that I needed help looking for another one, possibly a newer one. I absolutely love my Versa! ","It was extremely roomy and easy to get it in and out of. I had plenty of room for multiple carseats in the back when needed. There is also plenty of leg room so it was great when a group of us adults went out too. It is also really easy to maneuver (parallel parking, and small areas). Even though it is tiny, there is plenty of room inside. I was able to move myself in and out of college almost completely on my own (minus the furniture of course).

4.375,"ROOMY, LOTS OF PICKUP...",capergal ,07/20/2011,,,3,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Really good mileage - lots of pep on the highway.A little concerned with the braking - mine tends to go an extra foot or so before completely stopping even after brake is fully applied.Dealer says there's no problem.Also, the CVT, although supposedly good for mileage, takes some getting used to.I'm still on the fence about that.On inclines, it does help to slow you down without braking, but this feature isn't always helpful on level ground.As soon as you take your foot off the gas pedal, there's little ""coasting"" - it stops much quicker than any other car I've driven.Not so sure I like this feature.","Love the roomy interior - lots of leg room.
Even the cargo area is spacious considering it's a hatchback.
The privacy lid over cargo is nice too.

Love the 5 disk cd player!

Plenty of cup holders including in the back seat arm rest which can fold down between passengers.
I like the look of the exterior as well.

Like the in-door storage and cup holders.

The gas tank locator arrow next to the warning light is a welcome feature esp. after buying a new car.","The electric mirror switch needs to be moved higher on the panel.
Because it is so low down, when I adjust my mirrors and sit back, they need further adjusting.

Centre console is very inadequate - not much room for storing essentials.


Cargo nets or pockets on the backs of the front seats would be welcome.

5,Best affordable car ever.,knot2b4got10 ,05/13/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I picked the Nissan Versa because of how comfortable it was, because it was several thousand cheaper than any comparable car (say the honda fit) and because of the insane amount of room on the inside. Even though it feels like a compact car, I feel like I have the space of a small SUV. I'm not sure what people are talking about it being not fun to drive. Anyone that has driven my car has mentioned how great my car handles and it has great pick up. I feel like I zip and zoom in it.

4.25,Good on gas,Dave ,10/26/2010,,,5,1,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"Bought vehicle new based on price and estimated mileage. So far, has been extremely reliable, comfortable for a small car and actually somewhat fun to drive. For a small car, it actually is quite large and has an underpowered engine. But that's where the fun comes in. Keeping the engine in the optimum rpm range for performance and economy is a game I play. If you really know how to drive a manual it's a kick. The biggest benefit of all is the gas mileage. I've kept track since new and I'm averaging over 35 mpg. That's combined driving not highway. The only negative thing I have to say about this car is that the air conditioning is not cold enough for my liking.",,

Fun driving in a stop-and-go city you probably mean gunning it to the next light and cutting people off. Whee! You want fun, Mazda 3 makes more sense. For those of us who have commute on a city grid and not pick of a stable of autos, the Versa does great and is probably a better fit than the Fit. Edmunds admits in their Fit review: ""However, more comfort-minded consumers may better appreciate the Nissan's quieter cabin, cushier seats and higher available feature content."" I saved myself $3000 over Fit prices, have more horsepower and more torque, and a 7 yr ext. warranty.","Quiet for commutes, 30 mpg city. Stereo in the S sounds great, controls obvious.

I will get the cvt instead. don't get the basic if u want more mpg. Turning is good and brake is good too. the seat is high which is good because i realized it when i was at my friend car.

With the $4500 discount, $150 additional discount for scrap value, plus the dealer's free destination fee, I paid $5340 plus tax for the basic model. Mine is dark metallic blue with a charcoal interior. I think it looks pretty sharp. The car does all the basics well, but I wouldn't want this to be my only vehicle. I am 6' 4"" tall and weigh over 300lbs. and I fit into this car easily. In fact, I find it quite comfortable. If I had to pay sticker price, I would have gone elsewhere. However, for the price I paid, I think this car is quite decent. See my specific likes/dislikes below.","Great interior head and leg room up front. Trunk is pretty large. Tilt wheel, tachometer, and six airbags all standard in base model. Gas mileage average around 33 MPG in mostly rural driving at 40-60 MPH. Gas cap on driver's side helps with less gas station waits. Best of all---CHEAP TO BUY!!!",Gear shifts way too early. You need to be in 4th gear at only 35 MPH. This leads to very noisy engine at higher speeds. Front seats could use more padding. There is no key entrance on driver's side door. So you need to open driver's door to unlock passenger's door. Gear shifter a bit balky.

I used to like Toyotas, but in comparison to the 1.5L Yaris, this thing takes the cake.  This motor, for what it is, really screams.  I drove it through 14 inches of snow without a problem last week, and am getting over 40MPG highway on long trips.  My average MPG is around 34.  It costs around 7.5 cents per mile for gas, which is better than everything else I own, other than my Harley.  I did notice a drop in mileage after the synthetic oil was put in at the dealership at 8000 miles.  You're not going to beat too many people at the drag strip in this thing, but it's a nice little car.  ","Simple car, no BS.  There aren't many vehicles out there that are simple like this.  It reminds me of my old '84 Tercel, but with some balls.","Definitely needs a 6th gear or higher final ratio.  I find myself starting out in 2nd gear for a smoother ride.  I like to go around 90MPH on the highway from time to time, and that puts me over 4000 RPM.  The car can handle it OK, but it's not geared for sustained speeds over 80."

I don't know about the 1.6, but I find the 1.8 has more than enough power. I do a lot of highway mileage, and the car never has any problem reaching highway speeds. Fuel consumption is Ok... I guess that's the price you pay for having a car with more power and that is slightly larger than the competition. Due to the car's height and it's low weight it tends to get blown around a little on windy days, but again I suppose that is to be expected. I think the interior space is exceptional. My father has a Pathfinder and  it has nowhere near the interior room that the Versa has.

We have had Nissan since there name was Datsun, and this is absolutely the worst Nissan we have had for quality.

Two examples; one the serpentine belt squeals  not all the time - not every day; two the CVT belt has a low level gone (low frequency noise), you can sometimes hear when stopped and the radio is off.

I tried Honda's, Toyota's, Hyundai's, Fords, Chevey's, Susuki's and Nissan's. Of all, the Nissan Versa was by far the most comfortable-lots of legroom, headroom, backseat room, a quiet interior and comfortable front and back seats. It also sits higher off the ground so when you get out of the car you don't have to hold onto the edges of the door frame to pull yourself up and out of the car - something that gets real old after a few days. And Consumer Reports gave most of the car's components a ""Well Above Average"" rating for durability. Plus the most inexpensive and great mileage!","Alot of the small cars come only in a dark interior. Versa has a light beige interior, which living in Florida is much cooler in the summers. ",There is no center console between the front seats. Us big guys really need a hanger for those long arms.

Although I could get in an Elantra and Spectra for a bit cheaper, I went with the Versa because we liked it so much after test drive.  Much better leg room in the rear (compared to the other cars) and a very comfy ride.  The Versa handles very well, is fun to drive, and looks quite sporty (mine is red).  We really like the extra features of the SL model (since we have 2 small boys).  So far, I've gotten excellent MPG.

I drive 42  miles round trip to work and take trips when I can. I love this car. It is 90 degrees now and I am comfortable with the air. I have only driven it on setting three once or twice. I usually drive with it on the first setting after letting the hot air out. I have moved an office in it so I know it has plenty of space. It is very comfortable for anyone sitting in the back. I drove 211 miles at 85 miles without stopping and got good gas mileage and made really great time. This will get you where you want to go. It might not be the fanciest car out there but for the price. It is hard to beat. Artic Blue my fav!,I am the person that you have to move over for in the left lane. I love to drive a minimum of 80 hr on the hwy. I know way too fast. BUT this car does it. It out manuevers anything on the road. (I drive in Atlanta) I love this car. Interior is really comfortable and really easy to keep clean.,"I have to turn off the air to go up a hill or to accelerate really quickly, so I do slow down and tax the engine. But once I get there I am flying. I get about 21 MPG. not great. I can not drive with just the back windows down. It  actually hurts my eardrum, have to roll down all of the windows ouch"

We wound up spending $1200 to get the upgraded interior, the upgraded engine, power locks/windows/doors, keyless entry, stereo, floor mats, cruise control,and alloy wheels.  Basically $3000+ worth of features for $1,200.  We love the car and wound up paying $14,200 at carmax.  With the CARS program we got $4,650 for our 1985 dodge and the Versa S only cost us $9,550.","No safety marks less than 4 out of 5 stars.  Great visibility (sits as high as some crossover models).

Now, I am OCDing about not getting the SL because I am regretting not having the CVT for the many hills on my daily commute.  I drove Hondas for 22 years, lastly a 1995 Odyssey until 180,000 miles.  I guess I miss the heaviness of that van and the fact that it seemed to downshift on hills requiring less braking.  This Versa S if fine except when going down winding hills until I get used to the difference.  Any suggestions?  I am trying to shift into 2nd gear upon descent and that helps decrease the need to brake as much.  Will I get over not having the CVT?

It's hard to find one without going hybrids which can easily cost over 20K.  This one fits my bill perfectly.  Actually not all Versa have 28 mpg or better, just the 1.6 engine or the 1.8 engine with CVT.  Unfortunately, with such saving programs in place, the whole dealership was jammed with customers.

I have purchased 4 cars in the past 10 years and was looking for that perfect fit.,Comfy large exit and entry as a result of full size doors and car height which averages 4 inches higher than normal sedan. 4 cup holders for the driver!! All at driver's reach.. many storage compartments to store my stuff.,I would like to see a sunglass compartment by itself so my glasses won't get scratched or hot.

4.75,Nissan - get with the times!,Monica ,11/20/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a cute car but I do not understand why Nissan does not make the aux port on the radio (for mp3 players) standard on all vehicles, especially the Versa which is priced for the younger crowd.  The standard radio has a six CD changer, but who listens to CDs anymore? Seriously. Also, there is no armrest in the center for the right arm, which is mildly annoying, and there are no map lights which is pretty dumb.  I'm not looking for luxury, but it would be nice if Nissan would be ahead of the curve on the cultural zeitgeist.  Other vehicles in this category come with the aux port standard.  When I asked how to upgrade the radio they said I couldn't do it.","Good looking car, lots of headroom and footroom both in front and back seats.  My 85 lb dog fits in the back hatch area with back seats up.  Nissan always makes reliable cars. Fairly peppy for a small car.  Tight turning radius.",Aux port for mp3 player standard on all models.

5,An Excellent Car for the Price,ksmith45 ,11/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"For its price, this car is undeniably a great deal. The hatchback is sporty in appearance, the interior is incredibly spacious for its overall size and the interior is very well designed. While the car is considered a compact by class, it doesn't feel so while driving as its 1.8 L engine has plenty of power for the car, and the transmission has almost seamless smooth transitions. Overall, this car is perfect for people who want a sporty commute to work and great fuel efficiency.","The seating is elevated so that a driver has a great view of the road, is comfortable, and feels like they are in a larger car. The back seat is huge and has a stadium seat feel, so that larger people won't have any issue getting out of the car as they will never has to sit up and get out.","The only improvements I'd like to see is having ABS standard. While not needed in a car of this weight, it still is almost an expected standard today. Also I'd like the S model to have an aux port on the stereo for a MP3 player."

The pros rate it as just a blah, so-so car.  But they always compare it to another one that is 2-4 thousand more.  It seems they do not have to listen to their bank account telling them a little compromise is OK.  About the only thing you have to get used to is that on the highway, doing 65-70 mph, even in 6th gear, the engine RPM are about 3K, so you always think you still have to upshift.  ",The roomy cab and comfortable seats are awesome.  The car is quiet.  ,"For a couple bucks, they could put an aux input jack on the sound system.

I have always driven a truck or SUV and was very concerned about going to a smaller car. So far I like the Versa. It rides nice and has some nice features. The seats are comfortable and the car seems very quiet. I test drove 5 other cars in its class from other makers and the versa was by far the best one in its price range. ,I like some of the features like the bluetooth and steering wheel controls. The car is comfortable and runs very smooth. ,Automatic headlights and better cargo/console lay out. (More compartments to store things out of the way.)

5,So far so good,New Nissan Owner ,10/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Well, I traded in my previous vehicle of 6 years, a 2002 Dodge Ram 1500. Do I really need to say more here? I've only owned the car less than a week but this car is terrific. It's exactly what I was looking for. I was between this and the Honda Fit. The view from the Fit's drivers seat felt like you were too far back-it just felt uncomfortable. Anyway, going from a vehicle with a mpg rating of 15/11 to 33/27 is certainly going to have an impact on my trips to the gas pump (or lack there of), not to mention how much less it will cost me per fill up. I'm very pleased with it's roominess, and the 1.8L CVT engine has more pep than most people will think. Spend the extra $$ for the SL if you can!","6 disc changer, and I can now finally play my iPod in the car without using an FM tuner! Bluetooth is excellent, love the intellikey. Having controls for the radio / bluetooth / cruise control on the steering wheel is a big bonus. Roomy interior for a sub-compact. Highly recommend!","If you can find one with ABS, get it. The one I bought does not have it. The brakes are fine, in fact right now I don't even see a difference, my concern is future reliability. "

4.75,My first Nissan ever,dkiel ,10/09/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,After having owned a Toyota Echo and a Toyota Matrix I decided to give the Nissan Versa a try. So far I must say that initially I am impressed by the smoothness of the CVT and the get up and go of the 4 cyl eng. Overall the interior is nice but the front seat armrest is a total useless joke. It is not high enough or long enough to lay your arm on. Hope they fix that in upcoming models. Haven't it it long enough to evaluate the gas mileage but hopefully it will fulfill the commuter car requirements around town and the occasional out of town trip.

This is a really well-designed car.  The interior is extraordinarily roomy and comfortable and looks and feels great; there is lots of cargo capacity; the sound system is great; the mileage is good; the air conditioning seems very efficient and has lots of different adjustment options; the ride is decent for a smallish car; the exterior (I got the sapphire blue) is snappy; lots of safety features.  I actually look forward to driving to and from work.","Interior room and comfort; cargo capacity; price, fuel efficiency, and safety.  I also like the 6-speed manual which is sometimes hard to get with cruise control and other power options.  The engine seems to have plenty of power for the size of the car.

4.375,First Nissan,fenderbass ,09/09/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,5,5,"I always avoided considering Nissans going back to the Datsun days (B210s). When I checked out the Fit, Yaris, and Accent in looking for a simple good mileage car, I almost ignored the Versa, being biased against Nissan. I did my homework on all the above cars and kept on coming back to the Versa as the best overall value. When the dealer finally had a 2009 s 6 spd available, I made the jump and after the first 1500 miles, am very glad I did. So far it's a great little car that's fun to drive. I tend to keep cars (last car 1995 Saab 9000 with 305,000 miles) and felt the engine would hold up better than the Fit or Yaris over 100,000 miles. ","Mileage! Consistent 34 mpg on the first 5 tanks, very roomy at all seats. Power package included cruise control which I couldn't get reasonably ($$) with the Fit, Yaris or Accent. Also I found out the ""V"" has a timing chain instead of a belt, which is is disaster if it breaks. I love the 6spd.

With the trend in cars that are on the road going to cars designed like the Versa, Honda Fit, and Toyota Yaris, the Versa is a winner. The design I feel is more classy than it is modern or trendy.  The tapered design is nice and economic and it most certainly is a comfortable ride.  The space is a major plus, I never thought a small car would have this much room.","Plenty of space, versatile, does well on the gas, comfortable, enjoyable to drive, quiet, will turn a few heads, handles well, controls are simple to use, classy, simple design that's functional and economic, and a great warranty from Nissan.",A center console between driver and front passenger would have been nice.
