4.875,Beautiful car!,pauly_bananas ,07/27/2012,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Sold my 04 BMW 325 conv. and got this as my upgrade. I bought it from Rallye Motors in L.I. from Marianne. Great dealer and she was great. My other car is a 08 G35. This Benz is beautiful. It rides and drives like a dream. So smooth. Quiet. Comfortable. It's a pure pleasure to drive. Only owned it 3 months but it's thus far the best car I ever owned. They did a nice job with this car.,"Design - it's black with the AMG 5 star wheels, a spoiler on the trunk and and tinted windows. Love the wood steering wheel. The braking is the finest I've ever tried. It's comfortable, smooth, etc. ",Cup holders suck but the Germans insist you shouldn't be drinking anything while driving so it's not a big issue with them. Gas mileage isn't that great either. Stereo could be better for such an expesnive car. Have a better one in my Infiniti G35.

Also for context we have a Toyota mini-van and a Prius.This current wagon only seems special when you are on the highway. There it is in it's element. Extremely smooth, quiet yet with the classic German feel. Other than price it isn't much different from the Toyotas.Overall build quality actually seems to be less than the Toyotas I am sad to say. We have had a number of minor problems with the electrical and mechanical systems. The CD player still doesn't work. The right windshield wiper stopped working etc. In general it seems as the though the car is several years behind the competitors in features.","Third seat a plus for the kids. Auto tailgate, but warning it doesn't close auto except with button on the tailgate despite what the manual says. 

HVAC is simple and easy to use. 

Nav directions int the instrument panel are great. Rear fog light is appreciated 

Exterior design is very attractive. Seats are good

Mileage is good for a large 4 wheel drive car around 20 MPG. ","Headlight range is ok, not great. 
Outside Visibility is weak not sure if the mirrors are too small or just
something about driver position
Still need to work on quality control of the little things. 
Car has bottomed out several times in places other cars don't.

The radio is very difficult to set up and switch around from AM to FM etc. NAV is also mediocre compared to the Toyota.

5,Extraordinary Automobile!,Paul ,08/21/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My 2009 E320 BlueTec is a superb automobile.  Subtle  yet classy styling (black exterior/interior/wood trimmed steering wheel) that always draws compliments.  Extraordinary performance (400 ft-lbs of torque mean effortless acceleration - the power surge is like a locomotive).  Unbelievable economy (I'm averaging 33 mpg over 25,000 miles of mixed city/highway driving in the Washington DC area).  Comfortably seats four adults - meaning large adults! - and can accommodate five.  Huge trunk.  Smooth, quick, confidence- inspiring, so solid it literally feels like a single piece of steel.  This car is an absolute bargain and I never thought I'd say that about a $50K purchase.","Performance, styling (people literally scramble to get out of the way even in DC), solid feel, economy, sound system quality, build quality (not a single flaw in 25K miles), value for money.  Speaking of value - get the MBTex (Mercedes vinyl) vice the leather and pocket the savings.  Outstanding!","The navigation system interfaces are not intuitive, but it is functional once you take the time to figure it out.  The cruise control stalk is placed a little too low and the turn signal far too low, which takes some getting used to."

Only drive about one month and 860 miles, there is a front tire pressure problem that was caused by a crack inside of the wheel (rim). We drive this new car very carefully, never hit anything since there is no damage on the outside wheel, also how to we hit or damage inside of the wheel? That is a  parts quality problem. MB's warranty should cover it but they don't. Please think about MB's wheel quality, before you plan to purchase a MB, since we found couple cases report about it already. Also, MB's customer service is not friendly, do not answer customer phone call, and do not care customer concern.",,"Please take this bad wheel of MB E350 back to MB's manufacture, try to find why this happy, and improve it.

4.125,A very solid car but horrible nav system,Jan ,01/23/2010,,,5,5,5,4,,4,4,2,4,"Bought car because of incentives (with premium I package paid only $39k AND got 2.9% financing for 5.5 years, plus sales tax write-off)!  The car feels extremely solid and stable and has a remarkable balance of comfort and sporty driving characteristics that few other cars can match. Interior and exterior design are very nice and materials and assembly are first rate. However, vinyl seats are totally out of place in car with MSRP of 57k.  They are extremely uncomfortable (sweat inducing and sticky when less than 40 degrees F).  Navigation system is a nightmare, too.  Nothing is intuitive or easy and even after studying manual for hours the system is still fury inducing.","Very solid feel, good comfort/handling balance, state of the art safety technology. Sound system has great audio quality.  Psychologically, the car imparts a sense of relaxed superiority and induces very conservative, if not slow, driving. I have rarely been so relaxed in a car psychologically.","Navigation system is a nightmare. Voice recognition doesn't work reliably and there is no touch screen, either. Commands are totally unintuitive.  Vinyl seats.  High cost of upkeep ($300 for glorified oil change every 10k miles, vs. free oil change q15k with BMW), so so fuel economy with gas engine."

The car has been back into the garage for noises coming from rear and still has not been resolved by the garage. To be honest with you I am totally fed up with this car as it has caused me so much inconvenience in time and money. Furthermore this car is totally useless in snow conditions because it is rear wheel drive. I strongly recommend consumers not to buy this model.

5,The total package,Mike ,10/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the E320 through USAA buying service through a professionally run dealership-American Service Center- Alexandria, VA. I impressed by the cars looks, engineering, fuel economy, and the torque of the turbo-diesel--it gets up and goes. The quality of the car and its materials are evident. While the controls are well-place and intuitive, this is not the case in the Command/NAV interface. In particular, the voice commands do not measure up to the technology in less expensive Japanese and Korean cars. The USAA buying service combined with Mercedes incentives made the car more affordable- -a once in a life time purchase--maybe not. I love this car. ","The torque and fuel economy delivered by the BLUETEC Turbo-Diesal Engine. The high quality vinyl seats, the Hardon Karmon Sound system, the total top sunroof, the beautiful design, and apparent quality and engineering that went into this car. ",The Command/NAV interface is limited and not intuitive as the review reads. Hyundai Genesis voice commands and interface are more advanced in technology. I think German engineering needs to take lesson from the Japanese and Koreans on this.

If the subsidies did not decrease the price by over 33%, I would not have bought the vehicle. Also, the 2009 fixed a lot of the prior model year issues (e.g., COMMAND problems), and a lot of options (iPod, bluetooth, DVD) were now free.   At this price point, the deal was a steal.   Coming from an Infiniti G (more hp and faster), I like my change.  ","Pros: Timeless exterior design, SOLID on the road, the safety measures to protect occupants, thoughtful touches like ability to change vehicle setup (exterior/interior lights-no dealer help needed), all the cool technology items (CD/DVD changer, SD reader, iPod/MP3 connectivity), AMG package free!","Cons: Xenon is an option, ""where is the beef?""-leather is not standard, expensive to maintain.

5,Vinyl vs Leather,dj ,08/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Addressing the vinyl vs leather for such expensive vehicles, please note that Mercedes has a long history of offering the best vinyl seating ever made, which is better than most cars leather.  For some reason Americans equate leather with luxury.  In Europe many of the Mercedes sold have cloth/velour seating.  A final note on the vinyl, you'll be very happy to have the vinyl 30 years from now when your E class interior looks almost as new.  History and tradition are alive at Mercedes.",,

My past Mercedes included a 1999 C 230 and a 2006 C 230 and my dream has always been to own an E Class.  Back in 2003 when Mercedes changed the body style I thought it was the most beautiful car Id ever seen. I still feel that way about it. The car just has great lines and the interior is absolutely gorgeous.  The handling and horsepower is just amazing. The fit and finish is exactly what you would expect from Mercedes- Benz. The quality and workmanship is way beyond what you get in an American or Japanese car. The deal I got on the 2009 was incredible. Ask me and Ill tell you about it. ,"I love the steering, in-dash CD changer and the quality of the car. ",Navigation should be a standard feature on this level of car.

Car drives amazing & gas mileage is great for this size car. I averaged 29 mpg combined.  However, build quality is a DISASTER.  Literally, on evening home from dealership the night of purchase, the left headlight went out and I received an LCD error warning about headlight failure.  Took it back to dealership and 3 days in shop w/$3200 bill (under warranty). The C series loaner I got had same headlight failure during loaner period.

5,So Much More Than a Luxury Wagon,mercedesfan ,04/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This really is a fantastic car.  The cargo hold is massive for a mid-size vehicle and interior passenger space is impressive plus it is really quite easy to get a child seat attached in the rear seat with little issue and it fits very firmly.  The car is a blast to drive when you push it (no wagon should be this fast or corner this well).  The build quality is also fantastic with super-soft leather and fantastic fit and finish.

I found no major driving differences, however the HD radio, the NAV system, the Voice Command and the increased response speed for all technology functions is amazing.  There is almost nothing you can't do with the voice command system.  It even has a training module to improve the voice command's understanding of your input language.  Smooth ride and handling are accomplished with the sport suspension.
