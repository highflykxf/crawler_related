5,LOVE LOVE LOVE MY SMART FOR TWO!!!!,George ,05/13/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,"Hands down this car has been the smartest vehicle purchase I have ever made. I purchased the vehicle two months ago used with 70,000 miles on it. It needed just a little TLC when I first bought it, as it appears that some maintenance was due, or neglected by the previous owner. I had the 60,000 mile service done, as it is so important to have the valves adjusted on these little cars every 60,000 miles so as to prevent burnt valves and an expensive engine rebuild. It also needed several other maintenance items including a brake job, tire alignment, new belts, and a software update for the spring shift on the transmission due to a computer glitch that cause the transmission to occasionally not shift from park without a little finagling.  Overall I am quite pleased. This ran car really great before, but once these issues were addressed, I have been given peace of mind and more confidence in my little car. It also did improve it's overall performance. I purchased the car for quite a good deal, and even with the additional money I invested in immediate maintenance needs, I still came out ahead overall, since other Smart Cars with the same mileage and year were running at a $1000 plus premium over the car I purchased. I even recently took it on a 1500 mile road trip over very mountainous terrain with a full load of cargo and my wife and I both in the car. It was like the little engine that could. It struggled a little on the hills but it managed to climb each one and return an average fuel economy of 43mpg doing it! It is easy to park, I get people stopping to stare and ask questions everywhere I go. It is small on the outside, but spacious on the inside. It is overall very comfortable to drive, even on long distances. It is a joy to drive in the city, which is where it feels most at home. The seats are firm and supportive. The interior feels like it is well built and made out of quality materials. Yes Mercedes did something right with this car. Safety, reliability, fun factor, and practicality. What more can you ask for. I am already planning an upgrade to another Smart Fortwo in a few years. They have a life time fan.",,

5,Simply a blast to drive!,franktracy ,12/01/2013,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the 2009 smart passion coupe in September of this year. It drives great on the freeways here in Southern California, including the 10, 605, 57, 60, and 15. It handles great in all lanes and is no problem next to big rigs or in the wind. Also I have never replaced shocks on any car I have ever owned. I have always enjoyed the true feel of the road. This car fits that perfectly. I never drive it in automatic, only in manual mode. It's a heck of a lot of fun to drive, and seats are extremely comfortable. I recently took a bunch of stuff to a local thrift store. The guy unloading it was amazed at how much this little car would hold. I'm 6'5"" and I've got plenty of head and leg space.","There are so many but my favorites include: the ledge on the dash. I've never before seen a car with a ledge. It's great for laying down pens, pencils smartphone, etc. And it looks awesome! Other great features are: power steering, the brake pedal look and feel, gps, iPhone calling, heated seats, slider for sun roof, and the conversations it starts. And one big one - in the 80's I had a manual transmission, but always hoped that someone would come out with a car that didn't have a clutch pedal. Smart did that and also added the steering wheel paddles, hill assist and a floor shifter that is light and changed the way I think about shifters. Also, I love how much room is freed up in my garage.","Spare tire (although the tires on my smart are top of the line - quite expensive), and offer the diesel version in the U.S. Right now I'm averaging about 44 mpg, but it would be great to get the 60-85 mpg that I here the diesel gets. Also, easier access to the battery would be nice.

5,WORLDS FINEST GO CART WITH AC AND AIR BAGS,brabus4two ,08/02/2013,,,5,,,5,,5,5,,,"I picked it up in Vegas in 2012 with only 6100mi. and went straight to the strip that evening with the top down and the Biggest Smile on my face! This Brabus stole the show from the worlds finest automobiles as everyone was looking and pointing! This car satisfies my desire for a car, a motorcycle, and a Go Cart...The transmission is ""different"" relax and let it do it's job while you do yours Smiling...Want to go faster then use the paddle shifter!And those who say AC is weak need Freon, it was 113 and I had to turn it down and windows are not tinted! After a year I still haven't hit 7,000mi yet...I love the car so much I can't bare to put miles on it...So I treat myself now and thenBRABUS LONGTERM UPDATE:Well I gave up trying to keep the miles low cause I love to drive the car so much!I've had Absolutely ZERO Problems in the last 50,000mi, all I've done is Mobile One 15W50 every 10k, and a set of tires.My wife TO THIS DAY will not admit she likes driving it!  But she's always behind the wheel for some reason???  She and my 82yr old Mom always come flying down the drive like they are in a Nascar race!And that works for me as it keeps the miles off, and holds the value of our ML350 Bluetec...Our favorite use for ""Smarty"" is driving the her into our 45' 5th Wheel Garage and using her like a golf cart when we arrive at the campgrounds!We're always the ONLY ""Golf Cart"" with AC, and the only one that can ""Legally"" leave the campgrounds and drive on the main roads!Will never sell or trade as the Current Smart is Larger and in my opinion not as cute...Lastly, I wouldn't like it nearly as much if it were not a convertible...There's nothing like crusing on a nice evening with the top down!",,

5,What a great little car,sampbris ,02/05/2013,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have owned many many vehicles in my 62 years and this is the first car ever that I have kept for over two years. I have enjoyed my smart for almost 4 years now. I have never had a problem with the car. When I bought it I had a Mercedes ML550 and a Toyota truck...I soon found that I didn't enjoy driving either one of those anymore (especially the ""repair hungry"" Mercedes) and I sold them....the smart has been my only vehicle since and the car has remained solid, reliable, economical and fun. Everyone wants to know about it and you can never get gas without ending up in a conversation about it.The outer finish never gets nicks or stone chips and looks as good as the day I bought it. ",,

5,2 year old smart passion,mech_pe ,12/31/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Best car I have owned for commuting to work.Fun to drive like a go-cart. My wife loves to drive it on the weekend. Roomy with upright seating like a pickup. Flying rocks will not dent the car. 10,000 miles between oil changes. Gas mileage consistant 42 mpg in Minneapolis. Worst was 38 mpg in the deep slushy snow plus warming up in driveway. My commute is freeway at 80mph to downtown congestion at 60 miles per day. Easy to park and manuever. Some states allow straight into the curb (no parrallel) and sharing of parking spaces with a motorcycle or two smart cars. Plastic panels resist rust and you can change the car's color in about 4 hours. Very tough little car with good acceleration.","Fun to drive. Plastic changable body panels all around. Cheap on gas!!!! CONSISTANT 42 mpg.
320 miles at 7.5 gal.
(Not like my friends with their hybrids that get 49 in the city but 26 on the highway.) Comfortable seating, easy access. Will not spin out on ice. Enough space to haul groceries and some 8 foot 2X4 boards.
When stopped on a hill and you release the brake, it stays on for 1 second while you put your foot on the accelerator. It won't roll backwards. Cheap annual tune-ups. Great workhorse.","Transmission shifts like someone driving a manual.
Takes about two weeks to not feel it. Rough ride compared to a luxury car. Similar to a truck or motorcycle.
High crosswinds may bother you, unless you have flown an airplane; then it is just fun. Like bad weather is for most guys! Only room for two. You'll need another car for the family or a truck to haul with."

I have heated seats with black leather interior and my smart car is yellow with black panels.I absolutely love it! I couldn't think of any other car to satisfy my every need on the road.I have yet to drive it on the highway, but i'm sure that day will come sometime soon! I recommend this car to EVERYONE.Unless driving small, cool, and fun just isn't your style.This car is for someone who isn't much of a business person.But It is overall and amazing car.I'm glad i purchased it.","The heated seats,
The convertible top,
The leather, that is a nice and fit interior design,
Stereo setting with 6 disc change,
The hatch back,
The exterior design,
Almost everything!

4.5,Honest Car,Greg ,11/16/2010,,,5,5,4,5,,3,4,5,5,"I own a red and black '09 Cabriolet with nearly 30,000 miles on the engine. Overall, I like the car very much. It is an honest car; honest in what it is designed to do and honest in its appeal to drivers who want sensible fun. Granted, it is not a fast car and I usually take my time to get up to highway speed. That being said, most of the lag is in the transmission so once in 5th gear the car easily dominates in traffic. The ride is stiff, not unlike a MINI Cooper and handling is crisp with perhaps a hint of its weight in the steering. The interior is brightly decorated but feels cheap for its price class. Even so, the car is very sturdy on the road, the important parts being solid as rocks.","I love its diminutive size. This is perhaps the biggest appeal of these cars. The way in which they are manufactured messages my sense of efficiency and environmental stewardship. The convertable top and heated leather seats are the best features. Really, don't buy one unless you get the Cabriolet.","The engine needs another 30 hp standard. Fuel economy is mediocre for what you have to sacrifice in comfort and ride quality. Honestly, I wonder if it wouldn't benefit from a small 4- cylinder in terms of pickup and economy. The transmission is too slow! Watch out Mercedes, Toyota is on your tail."

4.875,Much more than I expected!,jtb9265 ,10/17/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Purchased a leftover 2009 convertible with $2,500 incentive and free options. I've owned Mini Coopers, Miatas, and Honda CRXs, so I'm no stranger to small cars. I am SO pleasantly surprised with my Smart car! I was expecting a good car, and what I got is a GREAT car! The Smart is unique, fun-to-drive, and an overall joy. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","Just about everything. The exterior is completely one-of-a-kind, and the interior is one you'd expect in a much more expensive car.","I'd read a bit about the 'jerky' transmission (only in the 2 low gears), but once you drive it for a few days, the shifting becomes natural, automatic, and smooth. It's really a non-issue, though a silkier shift through the gears would be nice."

4.5,Great CITY car,BRokicki ,09/21/2010,,,5,5,4,5,,3,4,5,5,"I just bought a 4 month old 2009 with 1500 miles for a MB dealership that used it as a loaner car. After driving 5 hours back home I was impressed, this little guy keeps up with traffic just fine, cross winds at highway speeds (75 mph) are not fun, so slow down over bridges. I bought the car mainly for parking in NYC.  I can fit it every where! My Smart doesn't have power steering, it's fine for me but you do have to put a bit of muscle into it when parking in a small spot, once the car is moving, there is no difference. It has 2K miles and there are already some rattles, not good! Only buy this car if you live in a congested area, or you only want 1 passenger!  ","Parking, pano roof, mpg, it has much more cargo room than you think! It's so much fun driving in the city.","No spare tire! The transmission should be a real 5spd or a real automatic, it takes some getting used to. Passenger side should have grab handles. "

I traded my BMW 5 series in for a Smart car friends and family all called me crazy but I turned 18 and had to start paying for things on my own. This is my only car and I do a lot of driving City, Highway and suburbs daily. I love my Smart and love driving it. I do wish it did a little better on gas but compared to the BMW it rocks. Having a two seater really is not a big deal and there is plenty of storage space. The car handles great and parking is never a problem.

4.75,2009 Smart Passion Convertible,Andrea ,08/04/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I bought this car because it was so fun to drive and makes me smile every time I get in it.  I've found that shifting manually lends to a smoother ride than automatic mode.  I've driven the car on highways at 70+ mph speeds with and without tractor trailers and the drafts following the tractor trailers does create an environment that pushes the little car around, but honestly, even my Murano gets pushed around when traveling behind tractor trailers at high speeds.  A majority of the driving I intend to use this car for doesn't involve highways anyway so I feel very safe and comfortable.  ","The convertible top, of course. It is just so fun to drive. The fuel efficiency is awesome too. It handles great and the compact size is a real plus too. The automatic top is awesome. The real bonus is the ability to change the color of the car by switching out the panels.","Like the other reviewers, a smoother CVT would be nice.  The Leather seats are not as comfortable as the the cloth seat.  A Tilt wheel would also be a nice standard feature.  "

They've all been great, but there's just something about the Smart! Let's face it, it's not a car for everyone - but if you do most of your driving by yourself (or with one other person), it's a complete joy to own! I chuckle when people ask me, ""So, can you take it on the freeway?""

I loved the 2010 Prius but could not see spending $32k for a new one. After looking around, the Smart car was my answer, similar mileage as my Prius.

5,Can't Compare - MORE FUN than Disneyland,DP of Palmdale ,05/22/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The dealer went over every page in manual and every detail with me. Disregard reviewer that says it doesn't come with a manual. Transmission is very fun, but like no other - if you try to drive this car like any other car you will either hate it or become frustrated - key is to understand this car is special, but it is very reliable!!  I commute 45 miles each way to work, driving through the Angeles Forest Highway - a two lane highway that has many hills and curves.  I average 37-38 MPG driving in automatic mode without using the paddles.  What I LOVE most - how it waits patiently in the parking lot for me to take it home at the end of each day, makes me giggle every time!","I love how it shifts. It is actually a manual transmission with no clutch pedal - but, it has a automatic shifter so my head bobs like I am shifting a stick but my hands don't leave the wheel.  It get so many looks on every drive and makes others laugh and smile and me, too.  It's really fun !","The radio needs to be upgraded to show more info about the station and song you're are listening to because it has plenty of room on the LCD screen.  Also, it needs to have a handle mounted above the passenger door - many folks think they need to hold on, so they don't bump the driver on curves."

I regularly drive my smart fortwo on the NY thruway, and the garden state parkway, up to the Catskills from Philly. Yes, the handling takes a while to get used too. But for the 2010 review to state it gets tossed around on the highway is ridiculous. Perhaps people need to learn how to drive again? Steering a huge SUV is different than driving a smart. I prefer the smart. Where it excels is when I am in my row home in Philadelphia. I have never had to hunt for a parking spot, maneuverable in the city, and awesome handling makes it easy to get out of tight situations. I save $200 a month on parking. Get smart!","Maneuverability, easy parking, roomy interior, sitting up high, convertible top that I can put down whilst moving. All the smiles and thumbs up I get from strangers.

Inside it feels like any other car.  My last car was a Mazda Miata, so the interior is very comfortable and the ride is very quiet to me.  The hatchback trunk is also really great!

Every day I am more impressed with my Smart. Remember, the transmission is a manual that is automated. It shifts exactly how I would expect it to, not an automatic. It takes a little getting used to, but once you understand it, it's fun! I am impressed with the ride for a 1800lb car! I am also 6'1"" and have plenty of room!

5,Love my smart,Denise ,11/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The smart fortwo is the most unique car I've ever owned. It's not for everybody but I love mine.  I couldn't wait to get one and enjoy every moment behind the wheel.  Even just looking at it sitting in my driveway makes me smile.  I didn't buy it for the fuel economy but I average 42mpg combined city/highway.  ,It's a real attention-getter.  I get stopped with questions and comments everywhere I go.  Even in traffic! The size is deceptive because the interior has plenty of roomy comfort and sufficient cargo space. ,Possible a tilt wheel.

As a fairly fickle person when it comes to cars, I never had purchased the same make/model of car twice (let alone in a row).  It all started with a very early delivery of my 2008 SMART Passion which I enjoyed for 20K miles plus.  While debating to extend the warranty or trade to a different vehicle, I decided to take a BRABUS for a spin. The bigger rims, heated leather seats, the well sculpted body and the better suspension made it an easy decision and now my Black BRABUS hatch looks gorgeous in my driveway and it gets a lot of looks.  For those who doubt the BRABUS magic need to test drive this car. Its a truly a SMART for the guys.",- Improved and tighter suspension. - 'Special' BRABUS exterior treatment. - Surprisingly good upgraded sound system. - Heated Leather Seats (Standard) - The smirk on my face as I whip through traffic.,"Give the US models a turbo! Its a pity that such a great looking small car isn't 'finished off' with the extra power that usually follows the BRABUS name.  Well, it appears I am going to have to add an aftermarket kit. "

For a great price, it's loaded with features found on higher-end autos such as rain-sensing wipers, heated leather seats, I take it on the highway as often as I drive locally, and it is surprisingly capable.  Keeps up with traffic, responsive, good stability. I cruise at 75 mph and don't feel the speed at all. Seats are extremely comfortable. Driving locally, it is a bit sluggish to get going from a standstill, but once it's rolling it does OK. The shift changes in automatic mode are quite jerky.  Manual mode allows for smoother shifting once you get the feel for it.  Very good car.","A/C blows very cold. Interior is very roomy, doesn't feel small when you're sitting inside. Get the comfort pkg. for $850, which includes P/S, auto headlights and wipers, and heated leather seats. it's really worth it.

The smart won in the end because of its uniqueness, ""star power,"" and somewhat because it is a Mercedes.  I was concerned about it's performance in the snow but felt reassured by a few other smart owners that it is effective getting around even in a blizzard with a foot of snow.  I'll need to wait until winter to test its ability to climb grades in the snow. I'm sure the SX4 would have excelled in the snow but according to consumer reports only avg. satisfaction was achieved by Suzuki owners, whereas smart owners overwhelmingly loved their smart as do I. The Prius is just too expensive.","Aux jack for iPod. Std radio surprisingly better than expectd, 2 speakers.

Ask the semi drivers on IH-20 how ""unsuitable"" it is.  As they pass, they check their rear view mirror to see how their vortex has affected the smart.  They have to be amazed by the stability.  Drivers are also surprised that the smart can be issued a ticket for speeding.  lol  Is the smart easy to drive?  Not at first, but with practice it becomes an extension of the driver, and is a pure joy.
