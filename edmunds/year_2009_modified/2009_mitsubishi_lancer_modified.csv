4.25,Fun to Drive and Dependable!,jamster3 ,06/12/2015,,,3,4,3,5,,5,4,5,5,"I bought my lancer brand new 6 years ago.  It has 110K miles and still runs great!  In that time, I took good care of it (nothing extreme), but I replaced the air filter at least once a year, changed the oil about every 5500 miles.  Have had 3 sets of tires, changed the front brakes and battery once.  Changed the transmission oil twice and that's about it.

I still get between 30-32 miles on the highway and about 22 around town.  The car has great torque for what it is.  Though it's not a luxury vehicle (especially the interior), when I'm at a stop light, sometimes it's hard to tell if the car is still running.  that's how good the engine still is.",Hands-Free - miles per gallon - torque.,a better interior would be nice.  The speakers got a loose connection early on (after 3 years).

4.75,Awesome machine,bfrost2 ,02/17/2015,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,4,"Alright so this car is absolutely worth the money, I commute 150 miles a day round trip and it runs strong with decent comfort. The only negatives Ive found with this car are if you live where it snows you WILL be jamming out your rims with a snow brush every time you get out of the car or drive around with the car shaking so bad you cant read the guages, it also doesn't do as well as promised on gas I average 23ish. You 100% want the rockford sound system and the CVT transmission is complete junk so buy a 5 speed. (traded my automatic back after 2 weeks because it was so annoying). Other than that this car is amazing and I may buy another one when trade in time rolls around.","Zippy, looks great, drives great, was CHEAP for what you get.","Milk some better gas mileage out of it or make it faster to validate the sports car mileage. The gauges are near impossible to see in the sun for whatever reason, add an AWD option to the GTS line or add a 5 speed option to the ralliart line."

4.875,Amazing vehicle,sedanfanman ,07/02/2013,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my 2009 Mitsu Lancer ES back in July 2009 and 70K+ miles later, I still love it! I looked at similar vehicles while shopping but fell in love with the handling, performance, and value of this car. I've taken very good care of it and haven't had a single engine problem. My one complaint is the paint. Due to a design flaw there is an unusual amount of paint wear on the side skirts near the rear wheels. Countless chips all over the hood (which, yes, happens. But there is a lot more than normal). One time, while washing the car, I was scrubbing off a dead bug and a decent size paint chip came off with it! That should not happen! Regardless, I'd still recommend this car to everyone!","Handling, performance, and value. Won't have this much fun with any other vehicle under $20K and that is a FACT! I also love how spacious it is. More room than the Carrolla, Impreza, Mazda 3, or Jetta! ",Needs better quality paint or extra protective coating. I've touched up the paint several times but plan on getting the car repainted all together.

1.875,One of the worst cars ever,bolshevik ,03/26/2013,,,3,3,1,1,,3,2,1,1,"I bought this car used with little mileage, after a few months I've had to put around a thousand dollars in fixes to it. I had to clean the engine because it was clogged, it has instability problems when accelerating over 60 miles (it vibrates), I had to replace a valve and some other engine internals because they were damaged, had to do injection system cleaning, and the worst of all I have to add oil to it on a constant basis because it just simply consumes a ridiculous amount of oil.My other car a Toyota Yaris 2008 has over 115K (I drive it hard and a lot) and I haven't spent a SINGLE DOLLAR except on the normal oil and tire maintenance which I do by the book.","Really nothing. The car is so unstable and bad that I'm afraid it will leave me stranded all the time, so pretty much I'm going to just give away the account.

Objectively speaking, the exterior and interior are pretty, and it is a spacious sedan, but the mechanics and quality seem like they were made with the cheapest parts available in a third world country factory.",Buy Toyota not Mitsubishi.

4,Almost 3 years going ...thats a record,loanshark_08 ,04/15/2012,,,4,4,4,4,,3,4,5,4,I must say this car is worth my money so far. Most American cars I buy are usually in the shop more than I getto drive then trade them in and become upside down. In July it will be year 3 and that is the longest I have owned a car. This car gets me all over Texas as well as a daily commuter. The only negative I can say is it randomly won't start but then will fire right up. I thought it was a fuel filter but much to my surprise this car only has one in the fuel pump in the gas tank? Upgraded the sound system and w/ Bluetooth makes it one awesome lil car. ,,

3.875,Mitsubishi Lancer Paint Issues,asharobinson ,11/15/2011,,,5,4,3,3,,3,4,4,5,"I was initially overjoyed with my purchase of a 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer but soon noticed thousands of chips in the exterior paint. I first contacted my insurance company who said that it was a manufacturer defect and will be covered by warranty. Agreeing because of the large number of chips, I reviewed my warranty booklet and followed protocol. When the service manager shared that corporate has been choosing to ignore the paint issue I began looking further into it online. I was not alone.Mitsubishi responded taking no responsibility for the defective paint.I've also had issues with starting the vehicle which Mitsubishi blamed on the quality of gas.","Sleek design, the price, features such as bluetooth and fog lights and gas mileage.

I just wish the engine had just a bit more power, and a little more quiet, but it gets the job done. I also love the interior and the rockford fosgate sound system, it's one of the things that make this car such a great value. However, my biggest complaint is the paint. It's terrible!

4.125,Best Choice Under 20K,driveboston ,11/05/2011,,,3,5,4,5,,4,4,4,4,"I've owned this car for 2 years and 4 months, and have put 40k miles on it, so I feel it's kind of safe to say I made a wise choice that picked this car from this price range and bought it. Driving experience is very sporty. I espacially like the steering wheel which is tight enough and very accurate (hard to find on other cars I tried under 20k). Reliability is excellent, zero problem since I bought it and all I need is oil change every 3 months. Interior is no fancy leather seat or luxury things, but you can clearly feel Mitsubishi put the money saved here into things you don't see under engine hood. Overall this car is not comparable to bmw or infiniti, but best choice under 20k IMO.","Sporty driving, reliability","If you're in a city that got lots of snow like me, don't use the original tires, they're not good on snow. I bought a set of all season tires and never got any problems with winter here.
Also, be careful of some dealer service, some of them lied (but this depends, my friend got same car and he liked his dealer service a lot). I used a mechanic I trust to do all oil changes, it's safer and it's cheaper (150$ got a 15k maintaince done which costed 600$ in dealer)."

4.875,LOVE it!,Rich ,07/24/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I simply love this car. After driving for over a year now (just slightly) I can honestly say I have only ONE gripe with the car, as many here already said: THE PAINT! It has to be one of the cheapest paints on the market. The second day after I bought it, I already had 4 or 5 chip  marks on my hood. And of course, paint is not on warranty. People saying this car is bad in the winter simply don't know HOW to drive in the winter, or don't buy winter tires. I live in Quebec, and I've had no problem what-so-ever in the winter. Also, my car eats Civic SIs for breakfast, on a straight line, AND in the curves. People saying otherwise are Honda fan-boys or Mitsu haters, that simple.","Engine, sound system, exterior design, sporty suspension, leather heated seats (Mmm), sunroof, A/C, 4-disc brakes (something most cars in its class don't even offer - Civics/Corollas), oh, and the acceleration!","The paint!! Seriously, add a coat or two Mitsu. I'm almost ashamed to park next to a Hyundai because I know its paint will be perfect and my hood looks like polka-dots paint.

I do think it is important to give a review after having a car for awhile to get to know it. The Ralliart for the money was a good car. Built like a tank, quick, agile, and had good looks. It felt like you were driving around in a shell, road noise permeated the cabin, stock tires were very poor. The car improved greatly when they were replaced with Toyo T1R's. Handling and road noise were greatly reduced. Good car for the money but needs some refinements. Happy with it overall.","Looks, Stereo, performance. Not on bad on fuel 24 mpg.

However, I heard about the paint wearing around the back tires prior to buying it so I decided I'd get the mud guards and keep it real clean even in the winter. I would never let too much salt cake on it and yet I still see the paint fading there. COME ON MITSUBISHI! I also noticed the speaker covers vibrate a bit excessively though I do like the sound system. All in all I'd still highly recommend this car I would just suggest it in white or silver so you don't notice the paint wear as much.","Handling is awesome, exterior and interior looks awesome and that dashboard display is slick.

4.375,Ralliart Vs Evo,TicoRico ,03/04/2010,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"I think this car is great for the money you spend. its 10 - 15 grand cheaper than any of the Evo's (GSR/MR/MR Touring) for a difference of 50 HP (larger turbo) and different suspension, rims, and a transmission (Taken from older EVO) Your spending most of that 10 - 15 grand on the name, and the small differences listed above. I wanted the Evo, but i didn't want to spend 40 grand on the MR touring. This car is a great deal for the money. You could take that 10-15 grand you saved and make it alot nicer and or faster if you wanted to. The car is quick and fun, it gets decent gas and is big enough for a family, and can drive anywhere due to its all wheel drive and traction control.","Cheaper cost, Turbo, All wheel drive, and traction control.

4.25,Decent car for the price,savvyguy ,03/02/2010,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,4,5,"This is a review based on 5 months of driving. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. The styling was a major appeal, plus it does very well on corners. The only gripe I have about this car would be --> the paint <--, thin metal ( i have a few dents already), cheesy interior, and some-what slow performance from the cvt. The gas mileage was decent, about 23/30. Although I can't complain much since I got the car with the S&S and Nav for 22k OTD.","Exterior is awesome! I love the 18"" wheels, headlights, Nav system, Fastkey, and Moonroof. The GTS cloth seat was definitely a lot better than the ES trim.",Fix the paint. Make it a little faster.

Because i live in Maine we sand and salt the roads in the winter. This sand and salt has been chipping away at my paint. It is chipping off in front of my rear tires. Much of the paint is worn off and because it is the design and paint is not under warranty i have to fight and i don't think i will win. I did buy Mud guard prior to all the paint chipping, but the mud guards only drop like and inch. In snow storms it STINKS the tires don't grip i think it is because there is not a lot of weight but.

For one of the few AWD cars on the market with a straight 4 and the turbo provides amazing power from 20-120+mph and is a dead accurate vehicle. Shifts are precise, engine is solid, turbo  is ample. Just a true joy to drive when you are in the mood. However, it's not a great highway cruiser or Sunday driver, it's a harsh and loud ride with little insulation and driver amenities. I use this car for a 65 mile commute daily (round trip) and it has its downfalls. Noise, moderate fuel mileage, VERY SMALL GAS TANK and loud overall with performance tires. But it is what it is: performance car with  power to spare & character to match!","The power! The addictive power.

It's as quiet as any of it's competitors, as corolla, etc. It soaks up most of the bumps with minimum effect in the passenger car. It's engine, a dohc with Mitsubishi Innovative Valve Timing and it's continuously variable transmission both work to make the ride pleasant. I've had two prior generation lancers and they all were highly reliable, with minimum repairs and breakdowns under severe use. The car is very safe and sturdy - uses very strong steel. The only flaw is that the epa fuel economy is already below it's competitors and below the prior generation lancer 2007. And when you drive it - it seems like it's below the epa estimates also - especially city.","Ease of steering, ease of braking, comfort of the seats and good suspension (excluding gts which is less comfortable).  100,000 mile powertrain warranty and 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.

Gas mileage is not perfect but much better than old car by a large margin.  Interior has nice style but the quality does lack behind.  I thought interior in GTS was better than the ES model.  It is a comfortable car for me, I'm 5""10.  Spoiler does block the view but you get used to it.  For a 4 cyl it is pretty powerful, but it could have more power.  The back seat has a decent amount of room along with the trunk for a compact sedan.  Overall a pretty decent car for the price.  Got mine for a great deal so can't complain.  If looking for a cheaper compact sedan that has a little bit of sportiness, the Lancer is for you.","The bluetooth, fog lights are real nice.  The paddle shifters are a nice touch to the car.  Mitsubishi added the scuff plates, alloy fuel door and a custom pinstripe to the car which really added a lot I think. Overall the GTS is the best deal in all of the models.","GTS badges/ stickers or seats.  Improve the quality of the interior, add more power to the engine.

Ultimately this was an awesome buy, great car for the money. Its fun to drive, amazing looking, handles well, I'm averaging 26 mpgs and the warranties are great. What I have to complain about it the rear spoiler, although adds to the aggressive look I love, its does become a pain when looking in my mirror. Also this car needs a 6th gear, but then again what car doesn't? I'm so glad I got this over the Impreza, I just hope my opinion stays that way come winter.","Overall appearance, value and the information display.","Throw a 6th gear in there and trim down the spoiler just a bit.

The sound system is great, but I miss having the Bose that my Infiniti had.  For the Lancer price loaded, you can't touch a BMW or Infiniti.  I miss the leather seating.  Love the Octane Blue color.

I highly recommend the manual transmission, its smooth hydraulic clutch and short throw shifts really add some fun to the daily drives to work. Also the appearance package is a must, it gives the car a great aggressive look. The leather wrapped steering wheel has a great feel and quality to it. I think there is plenty of pickup to the 2.0. I passed on the GTS because of the 18in rims and performance tires. I live in NY I didn't want to have to buy snow tires and switch them on every year.

I liked the GTI's power and paddle shifters, the Civic EX-L with its stylish exterior, and the Zoom-zoom feedback from the 2010 Mazda3 hatchback GT. However, I've found that the perfect combination of these features exists on a Lancer GTS, with all three available packages (sun & sound, technology and touring). Sure, it hasn't got the power of a GTI, but who redlines their cars on a daily basis?

I found the Mitsubishi lancer. And I loved driving for the first 5 miles, then before I got back to the dealership I new that it was my own car already. Its a fast one, with a lot of nice stuff. I got the sport package and the sun & sound package with the bluetooth, for only 19,300! I was looking at a Honda Civic coupe but the lancer is so much more worth it. And its a perfect size for a girl too!

5,A Real Quality Car with Perks!,CHensley58 ,09/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Ok, I just bought a brand spanking new Lancer as stated above. I just love this car. I've always been more on the bigger longer taller cars but if you're looking for a super fun to drive sporty fuel saving compact then this car is in a complete league of its own. I would recommend this car 110%. I looked and test drove many of cars before making my final decision. This car beats them all. From driving to listening to your favorite tunes to just doing everyday running, you just have to drive one to know what all of these reviews are saying. How many other cars do you see where none of the reviews can really find any real problems with the car? None that I have seen! Just buy one ;-)",The sporty unique design along with the easy to drive handling. All the other feature are just a plus to make a great car even better. 650 Watt Sound with Steering Wheel Controls/Navigational System/Remote Less - Keyless Entry System are just to name a few..,The only improvement I would make is to have other Lancer owners get the word out and stop buying those Plain Corollas and Space Ship Civics and get a REAL compact car with real interior features for a really great price.

The gas mileage could be slightly better, but all is still good.  The GTS vs the ES drive is night and day.  The ES motor feels like it is winding up and going to snap, the GTS sounds great while accelerating.  If you get that sweet spot on where to rest your arm, then you will enjoy the car.  Knobs are well laid out.  ","F.A.S.T. key is awesome, key doesn't leave my pocket.  Bluetooth works and sounds great.  Navigation system is nice toy and great to have.",Wish bluetooth would allow the Nav radio to list phone contacts vs just having a recording.  FM radio needs to have RDS capability.

CVT transmission is great; very smooth. 2.4 liter sounds awesome and provides good acceleration. the car rides like a beemer; quiet in the city and on the highway with very little road, engine, or wind noise. I got it fully loaded with the nav, 650 watt sound system, FAST key, stability control and HID auto headlights. gas mileage is not the greatest, but the car makes up for it with how fun to drive it is. would recommend to any/everybody.","turning circle, nav system, sound system, stability control, 18 inch wheels, fun to drive, paddle shifters",gas mileage and a telescoping steering wheel would be VERY nice.

4.625,One to add to your shopping list,BellaCroix ,08/29/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"This was my first NEW car (7 miles at pick-up) - traded my Dodge Intrepid.  I don't know how many times I've noticed people checking the car out even a stranger at the gas station who struck up a conversation with me about the car.  It's an absolute dream to drive, a ton of fun and so packed with technology that it's like driving INSIDE a computer sometimes.  Highway MPG is very respectable, city isn't the greatest but isn't that bad either.  It's not a car to challenge other sport compacts to a race but if you're looking for a fun-to-drive car with enough get-up-and-go to get up and go this is worth adding to your short list.","Navigation, Sun & Sound Package, F.A.S.T. Key, A/V input jacks, 18"" wheels, exterior design.","My only major complaint so far is that the design is obviously done for shorter people, it's very difficult to find a comfortable driving position where you're either not stretching your arms to reach the wheel or bending your knees and hugging the dash."

5,2009 Lancer GTS,J-What ,08/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I just recently purchased a 2009 Lancer GTS loaded. It's great fun to drive extremely perky 5 speed.  My only complaint is it doesn't have a leather option and the 5 speed could easily be converted into a 6 speed which would be a lot more efficient! The car is great the performance on it is extremely good for a 168 HP 4 cylinder (beat my gf's 08 mustang (it's automatic)) the fuel economy is far better than what it's rated at! I can draft behind a semi on the highway going about 60 and get up to 45 MPG (instant icon read 50 once or twice) but it overall is an extremely fun car to drive and I would recommend it to anyone! The car is a little heavy but it handles like a dream! No cheap feel either,I love the technology! the stereo and the sunroof its all great,rear interior light leather option and lumbar adjustment

4.75,Wow,fan4life08 ,08/17/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,This is my first brand new car I have ever had. I gave up my 2003 Pontiac Vibe for this wonderful car. I do work for carmax so I had a general idea of the competition for this car and I have to say that once I jumped in this car that I had no planned on buying I just bought it. What a great car. I'm very happy and I look forward to driving it everyday. It's quiet on the highway and seems to be pretty comfortable. My first tank of gas was 26 mpg driving in a mixed driving environment. I'm sure it will do 30 no problem on the highway. Great car if your looking for a new car under 15. I'd rather have this than a civic or a corolla.,"A\C nice and cold, ride is smooth, quite on most surfaces, very fun to drive, everybody looks at it",It needs a center arm console not only for your arm but to hide all of your stuff out of site.

The interior is fairly sleek with blue accent instrument panel. The 9 speaker Rockford stereo system definitely thumps with a 10"" woofer in the trunk. The mileage is pretty good for highway driving. I've been averaging 28 mpg which is what i was getting on my ford focus but this car definitely has the fierce look to it. A real head turner.

4.25,Awesome car but lacks something,RallyRed09GTS ,07/24/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,3,4,"Mitsu could have made a winner with this lancer but have fallen short of the process. It has the looks, the killer instinct and presence that tends to say get out of the way am going through. Has all the bark but lacks some bite. It's not as slow as some people tends to believe. If it want to go fast it certainly can. It lacks acceleration though.  Highly recommended for freeway driving (goes fast and gives decent MPG). Hate it on City driving (horrible MPG). Don't get me wrong, I love my car and I have it for 4 months now. Just wish Mitsu made it a little better","Looks, toys and gadgets, way it attracts attention though not an Evo, fun to drive, awesome sound system (Rockford Fosgate), performs well on freeway (great MPG and suspension)","Improve fuel economy, interior is good just wish its been made with a better material, leather seat options, improve acceleration, Mitsu cost cutting is quite evident with the Lancer and Outlander having the same dashboard (really hate this), handling a bit harsh on city specially on bumpy road"
