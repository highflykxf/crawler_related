5,Great Car,Edwitski ,08/03/2016,,4,5,,,,5,5,5,,,Drives great! Very comfortable!,,
5,We love our Flex!!,A. Ekstrom ,04/05/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,"We were about to have our third boy and I did not want a minivan, thankfully we found the Flex! We absolutely love it!! It has so much room, the two big boys love their spots in the third row, they have their own cup holders and compartments! The second row has about 47 inches of leg room, sometimes I'll sit back there just because. I love the front heated seats, even living in Arizona I use them all the time. We love the look of it, ours is all black with black leather inside. Next time we buy one I want two colors, I'm think red and black. We also love the navigation system and back up camera, the boys call it the Flex's iPad. It's easy to use and navigate and all buttons and such are perfect.   The few cons:   We received a new big sit and stand stroller after the baby was born and it doesn't fit just in the back. We have to move one of the boys to the second row by the baby, flip down one side of the third row and put it there. Our Flex had almost 100,000 miles on it when we bought it and it was beautiful inside and out, the only it's started doing is hesitating when shifting at slower speeds. After looking this up it seems to be a common problem. Overall we will definitely be buying another Flex, we love how comfy it it, how it looks, the technology and that it's unique!!",,
1,WORST CAR I EVER OWNED!!!,Tim Chouinard ,12/31/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,"I have been buying Fords for quite some time now but I have to say this car has completely turned me off to Ford. I bought the car as a 2 year old lease return. THANK GOD, I had the sense to get the extended warranty. I paid an additional $2,000 for it and it has literally paid for itself 4 times. I have had to replace practically every component of the underbody of the carBearings, Springs, steering column (twice), Tie Rods, both tail light housings at $550 apiece (not covered under the warranty), heat stopped working on passenger side. The list goes on. And the car doesn't even have 100,000 miles on it.I am literally picking it up at the dealership tomorrow and it is going right to another dealership where I am trading it in for a Grand Caravan. GOOD BYE!!!!!! Don't buy this car!!!!!!!",,
1,Very dissapointed,Chris ,08/07/2015,1,1,3,,,1,5,2,3,,,"Where do I start, mmmmmm.  All 4 wheel bearings went bad before 90,0000. Sunroof was designed to let water in, I think. Well it had to be as bad as it leaks. Fans don't work so car overheated. Stereo would not work from steering wheel controls. Gas gauge goes from 3/4 full to empty  in a second and then the car died, TWICE. The good news about that is that it only happens when it is 20 below or colder, so it has that going for it.  Seriously. I have worked in the car industry for twenty years and I have owned many cars and this truly is the most disappointing car we have ever owned. I wanted to support Ford after they refused the bailout money. Unfortunately I will be going back to a Honda or Toyota. In my experience, these companies have given me the best value for my money. Simple as that!Back to sarcasm: All 4 wheel bearings out before 90k, really?  Ford knew they were bad during testing, they had to know. So I assume they treated it as a profit center and said the heck with the buyer.  Well, two can play that game, so the Heck with Ford!",,

It is a 2009, I get it, things will go wrong....but I wasn't anticipating all the issues we've had thus far. Here we go:

1. Clear coat began peeling.  (Almost immediately after bringing it home to AZ, coincidentally just a year or so after the paint warranty expired!)  Looks like an old, beat up junker now! EW!

2. Ball bearing issue. (Umm, yes my tire was dangerously loose and that is totally unacceptable)

3. The door handles continue to fall off (yes, these cheap, junkie, chrome wanna-be come right off!)","I think I love how the whole thing is slowly falling apart before our eyes, the terrible quality and of course I love that the leather interior is slowly coming apart (even with proper maintenance!)

I'm sad to say, after growing surrounded by Ford hater but always believing in Ford because my dad and family did....I've finally come to realize why Ford is hated by many.... sorry Ford when it comes time to buy our next vehicle I don't think I could convince myself or my husband to buy a Ford again.

3.875,No Support From Ford,swaldron ,07/07/2013,,,5,5,2,2,,4,5,4,4,"We purchased this new in 2009 and overall have been please with the vehicle.However, I had to rate build quality and reliability low here due to the following:at about 30K (warranty) it needed a new front hub & bearing; at 44K it then needed a right rear caliper ($500). We were very disappointed that the dealer would not contact Ford about what they could do about the caliper (I currently also have 2 GM vehicles with well over 100K miles on them with original hubs and calipers!).The dealer had the nerve to tell me that he had a concern about using aftermarket calipers... I just looked at him and said ""really, right now I have to pay $500 to fix a Ford OEM caliper!""Going back to GM!","Very comfortable and well designed interior.

With in the first winter I had 1/4 of a tank of gas and the reader told me there were 60 miles to E. I was in good shape to get to work then get gas at lunch. My car dinged, read 0 miles to E and then shut down. This has happened a few times since and the dealership can't pin point the problem. They have even made it die the same way too (b/c they didn't believe me). Now I am left with a solution of don't drive it under 1/4 tank and don't get down to 90 miles to E. Seriously? Is anyone else having this problem? I am the second owner and the first time it happened was at 30k. Senders have been replaced and other parts. ","Ok I have to say I LOVE my Flex.

3.75,Sticker shock,surfredski ,03/09/2013,,,4,4,2,3,,4,5,4,4,"In general my 2009 Ford Flex has been a very enjoyable car, I've almost 50,000 miles on it other than the center console latch breaking in the first year it's been a good car. Last month I had noticed two of the panels between the doors was loose. These are about the size of a bumper sticker and run vertically between the doors. The dealer said it would be $198 for each panel. Last week one of them flew off the car and I realized they are basically stickers. The plastic panels are held on with foam tape whose glue is now failing.I can't believe Ford is charging $198 for what are glorified stickers! My car was always hand washed, garaged and Seattle is a mild climate. Anyone else see this","Love the comfort and ride of the Flex. The interior is nicely done, some with not so durable materials however.

What's worse is the countless number of times we have to take it in to the dealer. They do not acknowledge the fact that this car should be considered a lemon. It has a foul smell coming from the ac/heater, the brakes grind and pulsate when you apply pressure, the interior has a constant rattling sound, the front console latch broke off within one month of buying it, the cheap plastic air vent covers fell off within 6 months of buying the vehicle, and the transmission grinds, jerks, pops, and seizes up often. We bought it from ken grody ford in carlsbad, ca and they sold it to us with electrical problems in the headrest!",Overall I hate this car. I regret buying and the pretty exterior and fancy features are not enough to make me like it!

4.375,2009 Flex Brake problems,bassguy ,02/18/2012,,,5,5,5,3,,4,5,4,4," I was happy with the ride and feel until I hit 20K, and noticed a momentary grinding when I applied the brakes.Sometimes a gaslike smell was noticed after breaking.Quite a bit of black dust seemed to accumulate on the two rear wheels.At 25K a periodic squeal was noticed but the Ford dealer inspected and said the brakes were ""good"".At 29.5K the brakes made a grinding sound and were visably scored (rear left).My Ford Dealer said that ""it wasn't a Ford problem because he didn't have a servicebulletin that dealt with this problem!"".Rather than have him repair with duplicate Ford parts, I took the car to a Goodrich dealer for new rear rotors and new upgraded pads.","The Ford Flex has a smooth ride and in a sense is a comfortable small truck (all seats fold down).
When I am transporting adults they fit comfortably in the middle set of seats.
The heated front seats are especially appreciated during the winter months. The sound system is a pleasure to use (there is no need for Sirous radio when you have a good CD player on board).","Make the steering wheel more adjustable (forward and back) so that the driver's seat doesn't need to be used to compensate for arm-length comfort.

I took it in and they said I have to pay after 15k miles.  Then the second time I took it in they said that the brakes were dirty.  Horrible wind noise. Have major trans problems.  Revs up to 6k rpm and I have to pull over and stop. (no, I did not touch the shifter).  Took it in and they said nothing is wrong.  I am taking it in again tomorrow for the 4th time in 5 months.

Like always the dealer says nothing is wrong. I feel very unsafe in this vehicle and even though it is perfect for a family of 5- it is unsafe.  I have had the transmission slip into low when I was on the fwy- my kids and I had to pull over and restart the vehicle to get it back into drive.  The brakes continually grind.  The dealer states they have dirt in them- once returned from the dealer it starts again.  The brakes smoke and smell like they are burning.  I would love to turn it back in to get my money back!

Planned to buy a used Durango, but Ford's offer was too good. My wife loved the Flex all along, I wasn't thrilled. I felt like I was ditching my ""macho"" Durango for a boxy station wagon. One year later, I couldn't be happier. I'm 6'4"" and we have two young, but tall kids. The Flex has way more passenger room than the Durango and has already payed off in the short and long run. It's also safer and gets way better Hwy and City MPG. At $2.85/gallon, it costs about $44-$45 and drives about 400 miles per tank. That's better than my wife's Mazda6. We might trade it for a second Flex","MPG, Great passenger space for tall adults and kids - including the third row. Stylish and practical.","More storage bins through out.

4.875,Fantastic Alaskan SUV,Jeremy ,12/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,I have had this vehicle a couple of months now and have really enjoyed owning it.  I previously had a Ford Freestlye and it seems the 3rd row leg room was a bit more than my new Flex.  This is not an issue for the 6 passenger Ford Flex due to the 2nd row seats slide forward.  The 7 seat configuration does not allow the 2nd row to move forward.  Transmission shifted roughly in low gears.  Buying a K&N Airfilter fixed that problem and now have smooth shifting with no problem.

4.875,Still loving it,chuck from kansas ,08/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Wrote my first review 11/08 when Flex was first purchased. Flex (Ford) has made a believer of me. I am a retired automobile sales representative and sold and drove imports.(Honda,Toyota, Nissan). Without hesitation, I would put the quality, reliability and ride of Flex against any of them. I keep looking to find some small flaw, but so far-nothing have shown. I couldn't see any way the Flex could have been improved, but Ford managed to do it with the 2010 Flex. I have never in my life been so impressed with any one car. P.S.  I sold and drove the imports for almost 30 years. ",Size of navigation screen. Makes other ones appear to be the size of postage stamps. Outstanding 2nd row legroom. Ride is excellent.,2010 Flex taking care of many of them.
4.875,Great Family Car,westwood mom ,08/11/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"  Have had this vehicle for two months and very happy.

We have taken two vacations in this car and it is extremely comfortable.  I feel very connected to the road in this car and never feel the wind as opposed to my previous 4Runner that was difficult to handle in the slightest wind.  People still are stopping me and asking me about this car.  Easily average 26 mpg on the highway and 18 around town.  Fit, finish and performance are still flawless.

Issues to date: Cracked passenger 'A' pillar cover, chips from the flat frontal area.  Pros: -Great to drive across country. -No DVD player, but use computer w/ 110V outlet and male-to-male 3.5mm audio cord to watch movies with sound system. -Sirius is nice, but a pain to pay for. -Sync works well. -Navigation is better than anything out there.  Cons: -Like driving a boat. -No telescoping steering wheel. -No cooled seats. -Gas mileage is so-so. -Luggage space with 6 persons is tight.  Overall, satisfied with build quality and features.

5,Love the Flex,Jane Nemitz ,07/31/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I owned a Ford Windstar and as I now have 2 grandchildren, wanted a car with a bench seat for the second area so as to be able to accommodate the child seats as well as accommodate the parents.  Has lots of room, is zippy, and love the style.  I can find my car in any parking lot (right now).  Head room as well as leg room is fantastic both in the front and second row.  Car is quiet on the highway.",Love the interior as well as easy click access to the tailgate.  My husband is tall and the leg and head space accommodates both of us. Quiet and tight on the highway.  ,I have removed the front headrests as I like to sit with my shoulder blades resting on the seat especially for long drives.  Too big and bulky to see around.  Passenger head rest was a bother for any of my friends who got in. Just put in the same headrests as the second row and it would be perfect.
4.875,Best By Far,Jason ,07/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"We bought the Flex after our Dodge Nitro was returned as a lemon.  The Flex, which cost us about 3k more than the Nitro, is so much nicer I cannot put it into words.  The ride is ultra quiet and interior feels very upscale.  We test drove the Acadia, Traverse, Pilot and Highlander and the Flex stood out.  Gas mileage on an all highway trip was 26mpg+.  Averaging 19+ around town.  Telescoping steering wheel would have been nice, but I can adjust the seat to accomodate (6'2"").  2nd row is huge.

My kids love the comfort and the integrated DVD.  I love the sync for hands free calling.  We got it fully- loaded and we are so happy we did.  There is even a 110v plug-in in the rear...you can blow your hair while you drive. There are two charging adapter for your devices.  We love the Sirius that was included and hooking up our ipod.

2.75,Ford Flex Windshield crack easy ,Scbetances ,07/11/2009,,,3,1,1,1,,4,5,5,2,I have had my ford flex 6 months and the windshield has cracked 4 times. It cost $363.00 for a replacement each time. Ford told me sorry the nothing they can do it is the design of the ford flex and it will crack easy because it has a large windshield and will catch more of the rocks from the road. ,Room for my family,Windshield so it does no cack so easly or put a warranty on it. 
4.625,Not  Another Mini-van,Danno ,07/11/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"As a family of 5 and needing to replace our Honda mini-van, we drove everything we could think of.  The Flex won based on the fact it didn't drive like anything else we tested. The vehicle rides great, gets decent fuel econ (18c / 23h), and has tons of room. It doesn't handle like a large vehicle which is why it is becoming the favorite car to drive even when we don't have the kids with us. The headrests and non-telescopic steering haven't bothered me like other owners (5' 10"" tall) and I find this to be one of the most comfortable cars we have ever owned. The Sync system is outstanding but I'm still learning some of the features. www.syncmyride.com has updates and useful info for owners.","Sync, vista roof, family DVD, HID headlights, quality interior materials, sweet sound system, ride / handling, NVH, doesn't look or drive like our Honda mini-van (hated it), kids love the ambient lighting.  Also love the fact that free oil changes are the only reason I've been back to the dealer.",Still not sold on the exterior looks. The driver seat has a piece of plastic trim on the left front foot that I hit every time I exit the vehicle.  I expect it to fall off soon. The factory nav system is WAY too expensive.
5,More extras than we have ever had,Dave ,07/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just bought it.  Never had so many extras as we have always been conservative, just the necesseties.  Lightinng package is great and the sun visor has a universal garage door opener which we had never seen before.  Sync is great, car runs smooth and quiet and we got a long stare from a passing car as we left the dealership."," sync, garage door opener, power lift on back, HID lights, convenience package, ice blue with white top just looks and feels cool",Head rest but I raised it up and it is not a problem
4.125,Didn't want a van again,Ron ,06/26/2009,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,4,4,"   My first new car in many years. Ford has raised the bar. This big safe car does many things well. It is smooth and quiet, with good acceleration. I wish it had a telescoping wheel, because at 6' 4"", I can move the seat back so far that the steering wheel is almost out of reach. I like the ease of folding the back seats down. It has a ton of room with them folded (not a minivan though) I added a back-up camera/gps system to my SE and it really helps backing up. Tall seats hold you in, make turning around to see difficult for me; comfortable though. Solid highway drive. Don't drive with windows open;overpressure will drive you nuts. Mileage c. 20 in town, 25 hwy. Not great, but pretty good.","Solid, safe feeling driving. Like on rails.Quiet, smooth, with good pickup."," Definitely needs a telescoping wheel. SE could be be ""gussied up"" inside- too plain. Mileage is always a suggested improvement. A light inside the console- too dark to see what's in there, especially since there are hookups for phone, ipods, coins."
4.875,GREAT FAMILY WAGON!!!,Benjamin  ,06/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I bought this for my wife to replace her minivan.  I needed an AWD people mover... we have 4 kids under 11. Thought I was going to have to go with Toyota Sienna or Honda Pilot.  I'm glad I found the Flex.  Styling is so much cooler and Sync and Audio is high tech.  Two tone & Vista roof was a must.  You can't really appreciate vehicle until you climb in.  Interior is excellent quality & design. Middle row leg room is excellent.  As Ford says DRIVE ONE.  I drove the FLEX 1st and was so impressed.  I never got around to the Toyota or Honda.,Styling: I really like: Vista Roof Two Tone color scheme. SYNC hands free phone & audio operation Leather on Limited is very high quality.,All around a SUPERIOR vehicle. Only thing I can think of would be a Mute Audio Button.  A little better MPG would be nice also.
4.5,Pros and Cons Ford Flex,a david ,06/23/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,5,4,4,4,"Have had it about 1 month just finished a long trip down to Iowa and back.  Here are my thoughts. Pros: Enormous amount of interior room esp for legs and head at all sitting positions.  Boys love the ability to sit in diff places comfortably.  AWD worked flawlessly in driving thunderstorm on highway. MPG better than expected ~23MPG @ 75mp. Rides and steers nicely.  Have towed a popup camper and gear with no problems using factory tow package. Concerns: Needs telescoping steering wheel, adjustable headrests - no excuse Ford! Finding a comfortable driver's position can take time. Cannot buy a standard roof rack w/o factory rails. Door skins curve under car, probs w/paint chipping on gravel?","Room, ride, and space.  Yes the looks it is nerdy sophistication, nothing else like it in the parking lot.","telescoping steering wheel, adjustable headrests, i would like a firmer drivers seat, my wife is fine with it.  Door skins curve under the car.  This provides cleaner lines and eliminates side rails but at what cost?  We live down a dirt road and I fear paint chips and premature rusting."
4.75,Price / safety,John ,06/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"We needed a car for 3 kids and two adults.  I did a lot of reading into crash tests -- not just the stars ratings, but the detailed crash test reports.  1.  This is about the safest vehicle on the market.  Don't overlook that it's heavy -- crash tests are about running into a car your size.  Running into a heavier car is like a higher speed collision (to the lighter car).  2.  Some complaints around the web are about MPG.  There's no alternative noticeably better in this weight class/size.  Most are worse.  3.  Another con often mentioned is price.  Flexes are quite reasonable right now.  Ours was 22% below MSRP (after 3K rebate), and just under 6% below invoice, with virtually no haggling.","Safety; really quiet inside (there's a zen-like tranquility driving, at least without kids aboard); reasonably responsive; affordable. Doesn't look, sound, or drive like a minivan.  My wife thinks it rides better than our 2004 XC70. USB drive music in and car diagnostic info out, via Sync.",Our Volvo has a folding key.  They're actually handy.  The Flex doesn't. Laminated front glass standard on all models would be nice.
4.25,Check under the hood!!!!,blueacid40 ,06/14/2009,,,5,5,1,4,,5,5,5,4,"Have put 4300 miles on Flex by now. Good vehicle so far, not happy with quality of product.  Check under your hood there is electrical tape wrapped around a piece that covers the wiring harness, it is located by the battery. Trying to get people to recognize this issue; to me this is unacceptable!  Also there is a Special Service bulletin out for the Flex, if your door pillars have dents in them call your dealership!!

4.875,Fun and Not Boring!,Scott  D. ,06/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We wanted to replace our minivan and still needed to seat at least 6. I looked at this car and many others and kept coming back to the Flex. It grows on you quickly. Two months later and 5,000 miles already - I love it. I have had at least 6 strangers stop and look and ask me about it. Never had that happen with any other new car! I like that it is different than the usual common, boring SUVs, crossovers, and sedans. Tons of interior room for family. I am 6'-5"" and this is the only car I have owned where the driver's seat is not all the way back. The boxy style helps with the engine compartment and the maintenance points (oil, battery, filters) are easily accessible.","Exterior styling, fun to drive, handles great, and has no trouble accelerating with the best of the them. Also like the Sync system (didn't think I would use it but do all the time now), four wheel auto anti-skid and anti-roll, rear backup warning, and thoughtful media control features.","It could use one more foot of depth in the cargo area, but you can fold down seats to give you the space you need if less than 7 on board."
4.875,1st time buying a new car,Mike ,06/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This was our first family new car, ever.  We looked at a bunch of models with similar features but Ford turned out to best suit our needs and budget.  The salesman was great which was a huge added bonus.  We opted for the SEL with AWD, DVD, Sync, and Lighting and Convienience package.  Haven't done much with the sync but the bluetooth feature was easy to set up and calls on the cell were easy and clear.  I would agree the headrest angle is a bit much and having a telescopic wheel would be nice, however with so many adjustments to seating this is easily overcome.  It drives like it's on rails, and very smooth and quiet with enough feel of the road to help the driver.  Very first class feel.","The audio system is excellent and I look forward to using Sync to call up our tunes. I also like how sturdy everything is, built like a tank and feels great driving.  Did I mention the audio, wow!",Some interior materials could be tweaked (plastic molding is evident) and of course the headrest and telescopic wheel improvements would make this a slam dunk.  The bottom of the doors have a seem on the exterior with a crude looking weld job.  This could have been done better.
4.75,Very Happy,Jonathan ,06/03/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I grinded over this decision for two months. I looked at Mercedes, BMW, Honda, Mazda,GM, VW,... I have never owned a Ford. I have owned all of the above.  I think we made the right choice. We git unique styling, a functional interior, tons of space, decent mpg, and a great value for the vehicle at the price.  My wife disliked the head rests, but they are are removable and or reversable. The adjustable pedals take care of the steering wheel telescoping issues.  I am proud to buy American again!",,

3.125,BIG MISTAKE!!,Tim Williams ,05/27/2009,,,4,1,3,2,,4,4,3,4,Wanted to buy American and with the problems with Chysler & GMC we went for a ford. I wanted a Explorer but needed better milage so with really looking at any vehicals we bought the Flex. Traded my 2005 JGC. 8 days old and my check engine light came on it was only a sensor but it was in the shop for 3 days because the wrong part was ordered and I had to wait until Monday. 33 days old and my anti-brake came light on. Dealer had it for 4 days and could not find anything wrong. Reset the light & gave it back. We are suppose to drive it to Iowa for a family reunion but we are going to rent a vehicle because we don't trust it. My sister got a Traverse and is rubbing it in.  Kicking my-self......,The seats and the ride are a little better then my jeep but not by much.,Several but the biggest is the outside design. You really have a problem driving when its windy goes all over. And driving into the wind with its Square pants design gas milage stinks.

Were looking at Tahoes/Traverses/Acadias/and Suburbans.  You get a lot more for your money with the flex. A fully loaded flex is about the cost of a stripped version of the above listed.  It's amazing, the dealers that are strong, Ford, are willing to work harder for your business than those not doing so well??  Maybe that's why they are staying in business.",Very comfy.  Rides like a car.  Lots of room.  Peppy engine.,"Too new, not there yet."
5,New Flex,Jake ,05/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We were looking for a car with more space and comfort than my wife's Toyota  Corolla. Which we traded on the Flex. We own a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4WD. We love it but, the Flex has way more space and comfort. We took a 325 mile trip with it straight from the dealership. 24 MPG as long as you keep it at 2000 RPM's or less. The sound system is super. The driver seat in the SEL is more comfortable than my recliner! We went to our sons house and the five of us went out to eat. They were equally impressed with the comfort and space in the Flex. The cabin is well laid out. Dual climate controls are nice. It is as advertised by Ford. If you are looking for space, comfort and fair MPG buy one!","Limo comfort in the second row. I'm 6'4"" and 250 pounds. My son is 6' 2"" and 220 pounds. We had plenty of room in the second row.  My grandson is nearly our size and was happy in the third row.  Plenty of space. Fold down the seats and it's a van. Great sound system. Handles like a sports car!","The only thing I have found to dislike so far is the hump around the cell phone AC outlet in the passenger area.

4.625,The Flex Demonstrates What's Possible,Madlock ,05/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,4,"Even if the Flex's ""love it or hate it"" looks don't appeal, its superior fit and finish, material quality, and carefully thoughtful design certainly should. And if its tremendous utility doesn't make a compelling-enough case, it's comfort certainly will.  Ford took a chance with the Flex, making tremendous investments in quality throughout, and it shows. Its styling may not suit everyone's taste, but everything else about it should. Ford has engineered the kind of ""German"" solidity rarely found in American vehicles, and doors close with a rassuring ""Shunk!"" The Flex simply feels both solid and refined, and the Limited trim meets any reasonable standards for luxury that exist. Kudos to Ford.","The Flex's best feature is its overall thoughtfulness.  Nothing is frivolous, and the designers took obvious care to ensure nothing was ""left out"". All 3 rows are perfectly usable. It is simply a very well-designed, well-built vehicle whose comfort equals its other tremendous traits.","A telescoping steering column is perhaps the most notable addition that would benefit the Flex. Otherwise, much else could be added, but very little else could be considered to be ""missing"", especially with the Limited trim."
5,Good Things from Ford,Reid Umphrey ,05/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"It looks like all the focus from Ford on Quality has really paid off for them.  I am degreed Aersospace Engineer as well as a Certificated Aircraft Mech and ASE Mech.  I was a GM guy through the first 25 years of my driving life and had an very bad lemon experience with a GM Truck.  The GM service manager actually told me that if I wanted a real truck I needed to go to the ""Blue Oval"".  Went to Ford in 2000 and never looked back.  We were looking for a replacment for my wife's 92 Astro Van.  I stopped by the Dealership and though the Flex was just awesome.  I really though she would think I had lost my mind to think she would drive it.  The rest is history.  Bought one and really like it!!!",The car drives and rides very very nice.  Get 26 MPG on road consistently.  The interior is well laid out and very comfortable.  Great auto!  Great Job Ford.,The headrest on the front seats are the only thing I dislike on the car.

5,A smart pick,Steve ,05/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just purchased the Ford Flex Ltd FWD and can not be more pleased. Avg MPG is 23 which is 3 miles better than my smaller 2006 Volvo XC70. Fit and finish is wonderful and the interior looks like it's from a car costing $10K more. For a large crossover the performance is quite good all things considered. While some do not care for the boxy look I do, as it makes it stand out in a sea of similar looking cars. ",The Sync/ Nav system. At first glance seems a little intimidating to learn but it's actually quite simple. Loaded with useful features.  Seating is also very comfortable with the LTD trim,"When playing my IPOD through the Sync system, can not find a way to get a list of songs in a playlist. Perhaps it's available but just havn't found it yet. Would have liked some space to hide packages in the back. Even a privacy shade that the volvo offers would be good"

The real surprise- my fuel economy has been a solid 21.5 mpg driving 90% city 10% highway. This car hauls large items well. I put an 8ft potted tree in the back in front of several skeptical on-lookers. I have had not one problem with this car and it was delivered with 0 defects.

4.625,Shockingly pleasant to drive!!!!!!!!,Gotchagain ,04/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"I went from a GM minivan to this Flex. What a difference! Not that I didn't like my old Montana Van. It was just that my mechanic had it more than me! The first time I seen a Flex I laughed and thought what a weird looking car! Then I sat in it.... I knew then I was going to have to find something terribly wrong with it to convince myself that it wasn't the one to buy. So I took it for a test drive. Fortunately I was able to take it overnight to test the headlights out too. I do alot of night driving and the headlights are very important for me. To make a long story short, I tested over 11 crossovers/suv's from 4 manufacturers, and the Flex's ride, fit and finish, and style was the best!","The seats, the view out, the exceptional ride, the comfort, handling, stereo, sync is a blast, the bluetooth phone hook up is nice, etc etc. There really isn't anything to complain about!","I see that other's mentioned the need for telescoping steering. I think all they need to do is have it extended about 1.5-2 inches further out. No real need to have telescoping steering then. I am 6'3"" and have gotten used to the steering but the extra 1.5"" would do nicely. Twin turbo's in 2010!"

Gas mileage ranged from 25 to 26 mpg at turnpike speeds. Better than advertised. We also own a Jaguar XJ8 and this vehicle is more comfortable on a trip than the Jag. We are planning a cross country trip in the fall and will be driving the Flex. I was a previous Jeep Grabd Cherokee owner and the Flex wins hands down in every catergory.","Comfort, handling,interior trim",Telescoping wheel

The flex is fun to drive and all of my friends cannot wait to go for a ride.",I like how the middle seat folds down with a push of a button.

Even my mother in-law (a very large woman) said it was easy to get into and out of the passenger seat and the second row. Did not attempt the third row thankfully. Decent acceleration and stopping is also good. This is not a race car after all but a family transporter so set your expectations correctly and you won't be disappointed. The sound and video systems are excellent! Usually do not even consider a Ford. I am converted.,"Room, Seat comfort and layout. Easy to configure and learn gadgets.

Here's the highlights:  Vista Roof, Sync, Sony stereo, climate control, smoooooth ride, quiet ride and great looks.  It has tons of room inside.

Ford has outdone themselves and can compete with the imports with the Flex. The ride is exceptional and the interior room is huge. I am averaging about 25.5 mpg on the road. I do not live in a congested area so gas mileage should be good for me.","The overall handling, the sound system and the vista roof are favorites along with the lighting package offered.",A front sonar sensor similar to the rear would be helpful with such a long front end.
4.125,Ford Flex ,Jerry Beltran ,04/11/2009,,,5,5,1,5,,5,5,2,5,Like others I shopped and shopped for a Vehicle primarily looked at the Acadia and similar cross overs. Finally decided on the Flex for the price and options. One major complaint is the poor quality or the paint job and body work it almost looks like the doors and side panels don't aline properly. If you look closely you can see allot of overspray and the quality of the interior carpet is horrible at best you can tell that Ford did not spend alot of time making sure that they did a quality job with the trim. Overall I love the car but would like to see Ford put a little more effort in the quality of the interior and craftsmanship.,The look and the drive,Craftsmanship and quality of interior
5,THE BEST !,Anne Ball ,04/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this automobile !!! It makes me happy ! I love to look at it, I love to drive it ! My husband has never liked any of my cars, but now he fights me to drive it.  It really is the most comfortable ---smooth.  It feels like a real car, like they used to feel. I am short and I really appreciate the automatic lift.  I do not have to jump anymore. The other real plus for me is that it looks so distinctive that I can find it right away in any parking lot. I also loved the choice of colors--different from all the others in the lot.",automatic lift no cap gas sync phone and ipod space without being too long or too wide design everything,would rather have the controls on the steering wheel so that there is more room to put things down where the controls are now.  I need some more room for my purse etc.
5,It has outperformed my first expectation,Bryan ,03/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"It looks different and it is. First off the ride, quiet, smooth and a lot of power when needed. It corners fast and smooth full control. 4 kids absolutely love it gadgets and great sound system. Spacious and comfortable short or long trips. We have no complaints only praise a job well done. Thanks Ford",Our favorite feature is the sound system. Kids ranging from 7-18 the music varies and so does the volume. The Sony system was well worth the$. Combine the sync control of the music system with 5000 songs and you get what you want when you ask for it. Great surround sound for action movies too.,All the interior from the floor edges up is A1 but the carpet In my opinion is not up to snuff for a $35-$45000 vehicle. Yes i had to think hard for a complaint.
4.875,You should really look at this car!,Robert  ,03/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just purchased this car about 10 days ago so I can't respond to all aspects.  I can tell you this.  I searched  high and low and drove so many new and used cars and kept coming back to the Flex.  I actually liked it the moment I saw it, but inside is where the real story begins.  Leg room front and back is out of this world and no other car comes close unless you want a mini van. Sync is just awesome and honestly it drives great.  People may stare but that's because they want to know more about it themselves. I can't comment on fuel and reliability because it's just to soon. However, if the total package is any indication this a real winner. Seriously, check this car out! ",Room Room Room and of course sync and power lift gate are great. I got a  higher end SEL and it has numerous features that are all very cool. Like the 10 minute radio on feature and how it cuts off when you open the driver side door.,"Yes, a telescoping steering wheel would be nice, but if you get the adjustable foot pedals no biggie.  Would love to see more SEL and Limited models with out DVD but that have Navigation system.  Bluetooth needs to go to privacy call easier."
5,The (Seemingly) Perfect Vehicle,Troy1969 ,03/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Wow! What a vehicle. After shopping almost 12 months for a new vehicle I chose the Flex. Other alternatives were a used 2007 Cadillac SRX, the Buick Enclave, the Honda Pilot, and the Toyota Highlander. The Flex was the best vehicle. It rides better, handles great, and gets great MPG for its size (I'm averaging 19 MPG City and 26 MPG on the highway!). Sync is great but Verizon (and Sprint) won't let me use the text feature. Hopefully Ford will work this out with the mobile phone dealers. The quality of the interior is impressive and even on par with the hand-crafted SRX interior. The Pilot had way too much road noise and the Highlander, compared to the Flex, felt disconnected when driving.","Luxury quietness and ride, great MPG, Sync.",Ford entered the market about $4K over- priced. Rebates have corrected this. You need to drive one prior to buying anything else.

We already have a Explorer, i decieded to check out the Ford official site. I saw this 1950ish looking wagon and click on the interior and fell in love. Went to Chicago car show, saw one!  Went to our Ford dearlship, sat behind the wheel, purrrr-fect. Drove it with the pedal to the metal,(and a prayer), purrr-fect. Went home told my husband, he said wait until fall. I didn't speak to him for 1 week.  He took me back saw the Flex, didn't like it. Sat in it, purrr-fect! We now own a Flex!","Everything, the unique overall look inside and out.

4.625,Have a family without needing a minivan,From Brooklyn ,03/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"My wife and I are expecting our third child, and with a dog in tow we needed to get a bigger vehicle than our VW Passat Wagon.  We looked at the Routan but something about the Flex caught my eye.  It's different, kind of a retro look with modern amenities--so basically it felt like us.  So far, so good, it drives very nicely.  One of the things I like best is how quiet it is, road noise isn't very present.  Our kids really love it, and the automatic seat folding in the second row make it super easy for third row egress.  Definitely roomy, smooth ride, SYNC is awesome, satellite radio 2 yr sub, panoramic sun roof...all in all a great experience so far.","It's an American car; we hadn't bought one in a while if ever and that is important to consider.  Panoramic sun roof, SYNC, comfortable seats, auto folding second row, white roof gives it a Cooper Car look...unique, not a mini- van!","I am definitely concerned about the gas mileage so far, we are averaging 13+ so far; it's supposed to get 16-22.

5,Love it,Rfcurran05 ,03/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Picked up a FWD Flex Limited in February. With all the incentives, I got a Flex with an MSRP of $35.5k for $28.3k. The interior is extremely comfortable, well thought out, and is great for long drives. I just took it on my first longer distance trip and it did quite well. I averaged 24.5 mpg heading from Boston to the Albany area. Overall, I would say that is pretty impressive considering the size of the vehicle.  I love the overall styling of the Flex and it does garner a fair share of attention. It is very low to the ground and is great for those of us that have to load car seats in/out of it.","Sync, 19"" rims, comfortable heated leather seats, built in inverter","I am happy with it and do not have any major suggestions. Would like to see the ecoboost, which is due out in '10, get better mpg than the current models."
5,From a Mini Van to a FLEX,MEM ,03/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is the first American Car I have ever purchased and I am tickled Flex! I traded a Toyota Sienna Mini Van & have never looked back. The only thing I thought I *might miss are the sliding doors but it turns out the Flex doors are so wide it's easy enough for the kiddos to get in and out. People stop and ask me about it wherever I go because there aren't many out there. I def think the white roof on colored body makes it!  This purchase was supposed to be for my hubby and yet in the end, I won.  He loves it so much that we are thinking about buying a second Flex with a few less options.  There is not one thing that I don't like about this car.","SYNC, SYNC, SYNC!!!  Sirius Radio, comfort of seats, wide doors, body style and white roof!

5,Love My Flex,FordLover ,03/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was online as soon as I saw the first TV commercial for the Flex.  Finally, they brought back the Luxury Wagon! This is not a mini-van.  The owner reviews at Edmunds.com regarding the comfort, quiet, details etc. inspired a test drive and purchase.  This is a wonderfully comfortable car!  It is a luxury sedan with room in the back!  It handles smoothly.  I am impressed with everything Ford included in this package.  For the past year, I had been feeling forced to look at different makes, models and styles that I didn't LOVE because it was time for a new car.  So glad I held out.  Love My Flex!

Got a great deal but then the issues started - body panels out of alignment, shimmy in front end upon braking, large paint chip, brake fluid leak, Sync electronics went dead in two days - all on a car with 9 miles on it!  After 3 days in the shop, all bugs have been fixed and this car can run with the best of them at a great price.  Mileage higher than posted both town & highway, comfort features galore, unbelievable Sony stereo, but we too opted for a $10 cooler instead of the $730 refrigerator.

The ride is fluid and the gas mileage is reasonable for the size of the vehicle.  The interior is very nice and the Sync system worked as advertised.  Front and Second Row legroom is expansive and I've even sat in the third row myself.  Its a little more tight but you can usefully carry around adults back there for longer stretches.

It was polarizing.  But that was the genius the designers were going for. You either loved it, or hated it. Initially I was stuck right in the middle i.e. don't love it, but don't hate it either.  But the more I saw the vehicle, it started to grow on me. Then I had an opportunity to ride in one, boy did my feelings change immediately! From that point forward it was , 'I want one.' So I bought one. Turns out to be one of the best purchase decision I've ever made. What a fabulous vehicle. Don't believe me? Drive one.","SYNC, Sirius-XM radio, navigation system is simply awesome. As a matter of fact, the entire electronics package i.e. SYNC, Nav, CD, radio et al is, simply put, outstanding!","Not a big fan of the driver's head rest.

1.625,The Worst Vehicle I owned In 24 Yrs.,vs ,02/25/2009,,,3,3,1,1,,1,2,1,1,Bought 09 Flex  on 1/21/09. From day one the truck was a nightmare. The truck spent more time in service than any car I driven in 24 years. The truck has a problem with its trans seals which leak. Brought it in to have it fixed only to have a worse leak. My husband had to bring it back because he said it could catch on fire. It has a problem with the brakes which make a noise and feel like something is wrong when braking. At first I was told that this is normal for a Ford but after insisting that it be rechecked. I was told to use my emergency brakes if I couldn't stop,None,"Fix the braking systems. Fix transmission problems. It leaks and has problems shifting. Better suspension. You feel every little bump as if it is a major pothole. Also brake and gas pedals too close. If your foot is near the edge of brake pedal when stopping, you will also press the gas pedal."
5,Falling in love is so easy to do,Gee Man ,02/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Love at first sight? Nah, quite the opposite. But that were it starts, rather than ends. It's somewhat analogous to the smirk you received when you caught the eye of a beautiful girl, who later falls head over heels in love with you.  Neither of you saw it coming.  Experiencing the Flex is a discovery of why, as teenager, you wanted to get behind the wheel and drive. Why? Because it was fun! Lot's of fun. That's the Flex. Fun, fun, fun. Ford's competitive advantage in the area of electronics shines through like a stoic lighthouse in the darkest of night! There's enough technical features to  satisfy even the most ardent technophile.

Highway straight line tracking rivals Mercedes.   Overall ""heavy"" feel is outstanding.  Did we mention the seat comfort?","Even better Gas mileage!

5,Most fun car out there,sty ,01/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"It reminded me of those ""Woody"" surfer wagons. It's a perfect combination of all the electronics you can want, plus cargo space. We have an infant and two Jack Russells, and sometimes pack bikes.  Traded an Infiniti FX that was loaded and this was 10K less but had virtually everything the FX had, except for the V8. What it did add was space, a retro cool look, the great SYNC system. This was my first American car in 30 years and I would have to say Ford is now up there with the Japanese and Germans. The only option I laid off was the 760 dollar refrigerator, opting instead for a 5 dollar cooler. Great roof windows, too.

I love how the style is unique and different. I get excited knowing there aren't that many of them on the road. We took a road trip the day after purchasing the Flex and it was so much fun discovering all the cool things the car has to offer. It is a lot of fun to drive and it's great that my husband wants to drive my car now!,We are in love with the Sync feature. I didn't even realize this kind of technology was available. The DVD player is also a must have for the kids. Everything is so easy to use from the cruise control to dual climate control to the Sync.

5,Bye Bye Mercedes!,demarlelady ,01/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"In March of 2008 I bought a Mercedes CLK 350. I drove it through out the summer in Michigan and once winter hit it became a problem. I bought the Ford Flex Limited in AWD and figured I would only drive it when the weather was bad. Now I am so obsessed with this car! I have been trying to find a way to get Mercedes Benz to take that little convertible back! It even uploaded my entire address book from my cell phone onto my screen and now I have hands free calling all the time. It's the ride, it's the comfort, it's all the luxuries rolled into one.

4.25,Flex Findings at 1500miles,Pete V. ,01/26/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,4,4,2,5,"My first impression was it's a mini hearse or Mini on steroids. It evokes a strong reaction which is mellowed after driving it. We like driving the Flex but it becomes painful on longer trips due to the lack of steering wheel length adjustment. Our fuel mileage ranges between 13-15 mpg which is of concern and not fully acknowledged by the dealer. The nav, audio, heater system and display is inoperative at cold temps (mid 20'sF) until the vehicle interior warms up. A repair of the rear exterior appliqué panel was required. Folding seat locks need a second adjustment to work properly. Overall we like it and hope to get the bugs fixed soon.  ",The roadability and quiet are great. It's a luxury ride with a lovely fit and finish. The second row power folding seat mechanism is handy.  ,A telescoping steering wheel adjustment retrofit kit. Given the current market I'll likely keep the car longer so I wouldn't trade up just to get the adjustable steering wheel. I would pay for an upgrade. Greater clearance between the driver seat and door panel when seat is fully raised.

So far the car has been a delight to own. We feel very safe riding/driving in it. I'd recommend (with one stipulation - see improvements) it to anyone. All-in-all though it really is a good solid vehicle.,The ride is great. It is very quiet & comfortable. The visibility is excellent. Sync is a really nice feature to have. I love all the hands-free features. Very spacious interior. Nice turning radius.,"I'd love to say there were known. Unfortunately, the reason I scored it a 7 in performance is because I'd like to have a little more power in reserve and the winter (snow primarily) driving performance of the FWD system is very poor versus other FWD & RWD vehicles I have owned/leased."
5,Merry Christmas to Me,clteach1 ,01/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I love this car. My husband and I were Christmas shopping and stopped to test drive a Flex just for the heck of it. We had no intention of buying one. We were just very curious as it looked so different. We were immediately sold. It is so comfortable. We had a Christmas trip planned from NH to Kentucky with our 5 kids and were a little leary of making such a trip in an unfamiliar car. It turned out to be our best trip ever. The kids didn't complain once and driving it was such a pleasure. It certainly made a 27 hour trip a lot less stressful.

The Flex rides smooth, looks nice and manuavers the road well. So far I average about 23 MPG, a disappointment comming from driving a Scion XB at 28 MPG. I bought for more room and safety issues when driving from Arizona to Californa. I have to say it is impressive, but then again I like to buy the base models because I don't want to pay for repairs of the electronics if they break. I hope my Ford Flex lives up to the quality standards Ford has been claiming.

Second and third row legroom is very strong. Vehicle tracks perfectly straight on highway!  Safety for rollover on an SUV has to be tops with this car, as center of gravity is lower. Can't believe how much this auto has won us over. Ford is definitely heading in the right direction.  Very proud we dropped Mercedes and saved $60,000.","Seats are absolutely perfect!

4.625,Flex my Christmas Present,Bigg Will ,12/23/08 14:20 PM (PST),4,5,4,5,5,5,5,4," I love my new Flex SEL (previously owned by George The Iceman Gervin). The bold new look is great, I love being different and the Ford Flex's design is just that. The comfort of the seats and the ah of the interior are excellent. Even though the vehicle is not that high and appears to be low to the ground, once inside the vehicle you feel like you are in a standard size SUV. The stereo system is wonderful and the hands free sync system is a great addition also. I welcome the tight turning ratio of the car, it mirrors my Volvo XC90.  he ride is firm, sturdy and comfortable, a lot of fun to drive. I turn heads everywhere I go!  Never thought I would own an American made automobile!","I love the bold new look!  That's the way to go Ford! I also love the seats, they remind me of the first class seats in the airplanes.",It's a little pricey and I would like to see 10 way power seats standard for both the driver and front passenger's seats.
5,You make excuses to go for a drive,Bob Rivera ,12/17/08 20:31 PM (PST),5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5," Everybody loves the Flex, the kids always want to go for a ride. Most of the time, a new car is just transportation but this vehicle looks great and rides smooth. I park it in the driveway and neighbors stop and look at it with wonder. A new Honda van would never stop traffic, but this does. If more people drove it they would fall in love with this car. ",Sound system with the DVD player and satellite radio.

4.375,This is a well built vehicle.,cpd ,12/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,3,4,"I have owned my FWD Limited for three weeks now but have already put 1500 miles on it. I traded my  2002 530 BMW for this vehicle because I wanted a vehicle that that had more rear leg room for the kids and the sports stuff they need to haul around.  The first time I got behind the wheel it was like, I can't believe this is a Ford, the fit and finish is first class and it is quieter than my old BMW. The interior space is limo like, no more kids complaining about leg room. The vista roof is awsome but I will miss using my roof top cargo carrier( no roof rails with the large glass panels, if you are traveling with more than four, there is not much room behind the third seat. Highy recommend ","Quiet, smooth ride, great vision, massive cabin space, Technology- Sat radio, travel link, blue tooth. Fit and finish. Lower door panels wrap under vehilcle so no more dirty pant legs( nice touch and good out of the box thinking)","Fuel economy could always improve, lumbar on driver seat could be better, arm rests for captain chairs, telescoping steering wheel would be nice."

4.75,Very Happy Owner,TJHahn ,12/09/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We were not completely sold on the Flex because of the boxy design. The test drive sold us within the first minute! This car is incredibly comfortable, offers outstanding build and material quality and even with AWD, still delivers a combined mpg of 19. Ford has proven that they can still build a great American car with attributes beyond the foreign offerings. At only 5 days old, someone hit our Flex while my wife was driving, she didn't even feel the impact. She only knew that someone hit her because she saw the other car (a Camry) literally bounce off the Flex.  We'd drive through a hurricane in this thing!","Seating, space for our family, traditional ""station wagon"" design is welcome change over our old Villager minivan. Very comfortable.","After driving it - nothing. At first glance, maybe a sleeker, less boxy front-end. But, don't lose the character of this great car."

It looks huge but is actually no longer, maybe wider by inches than my 2006 Freestyle SEL. I love the way it handles and so quiet! ",Instrument panel says it all. Great!,The Flex Limited should have everything standard with no options. With a one model & no options. It would be cheaper to make. FWD or AWD only.
4.75,Happy Customer,Tink ,12/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"This car is great, we searched high and low and we found nothing that had as much style, comfort and interior size.  Beyond all that it is very cool, incredible retro look, great sound system and well designed nav/data system. I have already had the misfortune of being in an accident, I was smashed almost head on by a VW. The other car was destroyed and I barely felt anything. I was stunned at how hard a hit this car took (the police officer was very impressed) and I was still able to (sadly) drive it to the shop. We are not easy to please but the Flex did what Audi, Volvo and Honda were unable to do - make us very happy customers! ",,
4.875,The Near-perfect Family Cruising Vehicle,Charles from Canada ,11/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I tested them all. Replaces LR3 and before that Honda Pilot.  Blows both those cars out of the water in almost every way.  Space, space, space, comfort, drivability, features, practicality, fit and finish, design are all superb.  Never seen a Ford like this before. Did a couple road trips with the wife and 2 kids and it was amazing for everyone. Separate seats and huge storage bin in the back for kids. Bought with separate screens in headrests so each kid could watch a movie of choice or my daughter could plug in laptap in 110V plug or son could plug in Game cube to screen. Comfortable seats, smooth drive, feeling of safety, great nav/sat radio for the adults. Outstanding vehicle!","Seat comfort, limo/BMW7-like leg room; Separate seats in 2nd row; Sync system is best entertainment/nav system in world; very quiet, smooth, ride with smooth power train that can handle anything and is still very reasonable on gas for size; automatic folding 2nd row; 110V plug; Ford brand not flashy","The only real one is the lack of telescoping steering column - this has mentioned in almost every professional review, too bad but not the end of the world;  the other issue often mentioned is headrest discomfort, but have not had this problem, perhaps because of the screens in headrest we ordered"
5,Very Fun Vehicle,Jon Grant ,11/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Wow! I am so pleased with my new Flex. My family needs a lot of  room and seating capacity. Our last vehicle was a 1994 Ford conversion van. We were looking for vehicle with better gas milage. Our van gets 12 mpg around town. We drove a lot of other SUV's and crossover's. They were all the same. I drove the Flex and was immediately impressed with the excellent layout and comfort of the interior. Ford has alot of really cool stuff like SYNC and free Sirius service for 6 months. I was suprised how much seating room the Flex has even in the third row. But the styling of the exterior makes me grin every time I look at it. I cant express how happy I am with my Flex, I highly recomend this vehicle","The looks, drive, quietness, and the cool stuff inside.",None yet.
4.875,Ex Ford Hater,Chuck from Kansas ,11/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I will start by saying that I am a retired automobile salesman. (28 yrs) I have own many new/used cars, mostly foreign. My wife picked the Flex, I reluctantly went along with it. After an 8 week wait for our ordered Flex, it was finally here.  It was well worth the wait, and I believe it will certainly change my opinion of Ford products.  We ordered a FWD limited with Nav. The Nav system will do everything but cook lunch for you. The SYNC system is surprisingly simple to operate. The second row legroom is outstanding. This car, in my opinion, is a much smoother, quieter ride than the 07 Toyota Sienna we traded in. Dont know about the mpg yet, but should be as good or better than Sienna.","Navigation, SYNC, sunroof, ambient lighting. Quality interior, comfortible seats.","Outside of what other consumers have already discussed, would like to see turn signal indicators in the exterior mirrors."
5,What a transporter!,RM ,11/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Wonderful vehicle that keeps getting better. This vehicle is very quiet on the road especially on the highway. Speed control best I have ever used. The transmission is truly flawless. The ride is well controlled and steering precise. I have owned many high marque brands including BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, and a VW Phaeton. Ford has done a tremendous job with this vehicle. Presently averaging 23 mpg with city and highway miles. Anyone interested in a people mover/ luxury drive not so full of  pomp but great fun to drive should check this vehicle out.  ",Navigation /seats,Telescopic steering wheel. Improved gas mpg
5,Even Better Than I Expected,Hazz ,11/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We bought this vehicle for practical reasons but have been impressed with how comfortable and fun to drive it is. It receives constant glances and questions - and all of them have been very favorable.,The flexibility and comfort.,Only comment is the headrests are rakes aggressively forward and can block vision when merging from the left.
5,Ford Makes a Breakthrough!,Will's Films C.E.O. ,10/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The all new Ford Flex is just what I have been waiting for from Ford. Ford has mad a tremendous effort to make good styling, comfort, good gas mileage, and advance technology and they achieved all of those goals with the Ford Flex. I am very satisfied with the Sync system. It makes driving and talking on the phone so easy. I was shocked to find so much leg room in the first, second, and third row. And the technology and devices are out of this world amazing. I love the sun roof(s) that are in each seat, navigation system, DVD players, refrigerator, the power outlets, rear view camera, power lifting tailgate, and the heating and cooling seats it surely makes my life a lot funner and easier.","My favorite features about the Flex are the navigation system, plug sockets, sync system, and sun roofs.",The only improvment that Ford should make to the Flex is the gas mileage. I figured that they could at least get into the 30+ mpg area. 
4.875,Very pleased,HRM ,10/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,So my husband went in for an oil change on his beloved Mustang a few weeks ago and I ended up with a Flex!  We were looking for a new car for me as I am requiring heated seats before moving from GA to Ohio. The consumer reviews were a main selling point. Once he drove it we were sold. It does drive remarkably well. The Sirius is addicting. I am avg height & have not noticed the issue with the headrests. My first drive was going through mountains from KY to GA. I hate driving downhill but felt way more comfortable than in my previous SUV. This week I had to drive home through flooding rain and the car handled as if the roads were dry. People at work stop me to compliment the car.,"The drive, Sirius.Red paint. Multiple temp controls. Rear door is very easy to handle. Info center on dash. Tons of space in 2nd row",Very minor:  increase size of storage compartments on doors.
4.75,Funky and Fun,k. black ,10/06/2008,,,5,3,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded an 2007 Ford Edge in on an 2009 Ford Flex. I'll be honest, I'm still unsure about the exterior appearance and have taken a lot of ribbing about it being a ""midget hearse"" but you don't ride on the outside and the interior is awesome.","Sync, vista multi panel roof",Ford needs power telescopic steering wheel on their vehicles. I would pay more to have this feature as an option.
5,The Flex Rocks!,Ludell ,09/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"It came down to the Highlander and the Flex. We went with the Flex Limited with the 2nd row bench loaded with everything except for the vista moon roof and couldn't be any happier. For the same price of a Highlander Sport, you can get a top of the line Flex with all the bells and whistles. The car breaks necks everywhere you go and people are constantly asking me questions about it. I never thought I'd ever buy a domestic car, but Ford made me a believer with the excellent quality and styling they used on the Flex. I have a 2004 Pilot and the Flex feels better, looks better, and gets the same MPG. The white roof on the dark metallic blue paint really pops. ","The navigation system is top notch, industry best. Sync and Sirius Travel link are keep me smiling. Kids love the DVD player. Best seat in the car is definitely the 2nd row; so much leg room it's unbeliveable comfy (comes with footrests too). Plenty of storage space even with 3rd row up!","I wish the Limited came with 22"" rims instead of the 19's. "
4.875,JR's Flex Review,John R. Robinson ,09/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We purchased a Ford Flex as our ""people mover"" for a family of six. Our previous work horses were a Suburban (160K miles) and a Honda Odyssey (130K miles). I loved the Suburban, the Odyssey was adequate, but am wowed so far by the Flex. We opted for 50/50 2nd row seating. This combined with the 50/50 3rd row seating has lead to little to no arguments about who sits in back!  (all seats are equally comfortable) The interior features are great. We opted for the sky lights and this really opens up the passenger seating.  My wife quickly fell in love with the bluetooth/SYNC capabilities and enjoys hands free cell phone talking while driving. 4500 miles so far and no regrets.  A winner! ","Unique styling. It's a head turner, we gets lots of comments like: ""what is this?"". Riding comfort. It's a cross between your dad's Cadailac or Lincoln and your old SUV.  Styling and fund to drive. The kids love it and my wife enjoy's Flexin'. Push button access to 3rd row seating.","Fuel economy - better than most or all in its class, but room for improvement.  You've read about the head rests by now. . .tilt your seat back slightly and the problem is less noticable.  I hope Ford provides more exterior color choices in future years. "
5,Great car,Mark ,09/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This vehicle is outstanding for the family. Second row room is uncanny. The fuel economy is excellent for such a large vehicle. I recorded 25 MPG on a road trip and averaged about 21 total MPG so far in my travels. The inside of this vehicle is so quiet, it is like driving a Lexus. I wasn't completely sold on it until I drove it. And it can tow my boat (4500 lbs) ",,
3.625,Great car with major design flaw!,Ray Thompson ,09/21/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,3,4,3,3,"Most people won't care about this, but there is a design flaw in the Flex. I ordered one and felt the vehicle was ideal for me in most ways. I'm very tall and the headroom and legroom are exceptional. Which is great, except for the fact that a tall person (I'm 6'7"") cannot comfortably drive this vehicle!  Because it lacks a telescoping steering column, even my long arms are at full extension with no bend at the elbows. This became uncomfortable even during a short drive; during a long trip it would be unbearable.","Good execution of Sync technology, much better design and fit/finish than previous Ford products, nice touches like large sunroof and rear refrigerator","Telescopic steering column, please!  Also, better engines are required ASAP; the EcoBoost or a good Euro-style diesel would transform this car into something special!"
4.75,I love it,Mike R ,09/17/2008,,,5,5,3,5,,5,5,5,5,"Ford Flex rides as smooth as a luxury vehicle. Interior is thoughtfully appointed and the electronics are fantastic.

4.875,Flex almost perfect,clanger8525 ,09/16/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just got our Flex. Took some time as we must have been one of only a few people that wanted the Limited AWD with middle row bench. Came out of an LR3, so we are getting way better mileage. 17-24 is great for a 7 passenger vehicle. Way quieter and a better drive than an 09 Pilot (our only other serious contender) Super comfortable, and the Sync Nav system is awesome.  My only complaint - The door clearance is only 9.5 inches, so it's highly likely we'll be scraping the curb on a regular basis.  To put this in perspective, my Porsche 911 has 11.5"" of clearance - so I consider that a real problem that people should know about when making their buying decisions","Styling. Sync with Nav and touch screen. Comfort. Quiet and stable on the freeway. Probably the nicest interior you can get in this price range, and it doesn't drive like a truck or mini van (unlike Pilot and Acadia). Overall 9.5 out of 10.  You won't be dissapointed!","Door clearance! I guess its a trade of for the slick design, but had i known prior to getting the car, it could have been a deal breaker, but only since i live in a city with lots of un-even sidewalks. Probably not an issue  you live in the burbs."
5,Very Happy,New Car ,09/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After looking at crossovers over the past several months, narrowed it down to Flex limited and Mercedes R350.

4.75,First Impression and Experience,Footnote ,09/07/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"We've had our Flex for about 2 months now and find it to be one of the most satisfying cars we've ever owned.  My wife's first impession was that it looked like a hearse and she wanted nothing to do with it. Once she sat in it and drove it she liked it as much as I did. It is the most comfortable and quite car we've ever owned. Recently we were caught up in a storm outside Lubbock, TX. In particular the winds were terrible. This car was rock steady on the road with no swaying at all.  Inside it was quite and relaxed. We even watched as the front move through on the doppler radar image on our navigation unit. We love this car.","Microsoft Sync system, Sirius satelite Information Link. Plush, quiet interior. Comfortable suspension. Backup camera",The only thing I wish it had is a telescoping steering column.

5,Lovin' It,bleary travelers ,09/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The week after we bought our solid silver Flex we took a 4,000 mile road trip. Had many chances to check fuel economy with the cruise control on and came up with these numbers: 80 mph - 23 mpg; 70 mph - 24 mpg; 60 mph - 28+ mpg. Very pleased! The ride is really comfortable except (as others have noted) the head rests tilt forward. I experienced the same thing when we test drove an '09 Pilot. I talked my husband into this car - he's 6'3"", I'm 5'0"" and we both love driving it. Plenty of cargo space (musician hauling keyboards & amps). Can't answer as to reliability yet, but this replaces our '99 Explorer that had 175k miles on it. I don't expect anything less from the Flex","Luxury interior feel, fold-flat 2nd & 3rd row seats, mileage for large vehicle, SYNC ","Head-rest setup is to prevent whiplash, but I see that others are doing what I do - raising the headrest, which pretty much defeats the purpose. If the rear cargo area was just 1"" wider golf clubs would lay flat behind the 3rd row. Right now mine just fit, but hubby has to take woods out of the bag"
4.875,My new Ford Flex,rgurta ,08/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I am very impressed with all aspects of my red Ford Flex SEL. It is very roomy and the quality is outstanding. My only cons on this vehicle is that I find my front seat headrests to be very uncomfortable and that the two second row captain chairs need armrests. The sync radio with bluetooth hands free cell phone features are a real plus. I can not get over how many people have asked to see my car and how many  heads it turns when being driven.  It is hard to believe that the dimensions on this roomy vehicle is almost identical to my 2005 Ford Freestyle. I am getting better than 20 miles to the gallon so far in mixed driving conditions.,"Quality, interior room, large seats, Sony sync radio, hands free cell phone hook up. My wife and I are senior citizens and have difficulty in getting in and out of sedans. Ease of getting in and out of our Flex is a blessing for us. ",Redesign front seat headrests and provide arm rests for the second row captains chairs. Increase public awareness of this great vehicle.
4.5,Flex is great,Joe ,08/25/2008,,,5,4,4,5,,4,5,4,5,Traded in 05 Navigator and now save $225/month in gas. While we will miss the Nav this car is pure fun. We've had it for a few weeks now and no less than 20 people have asked us about. Too cool!,Gas mileage. Interior room (incl. storage well behind third row!) is as good or better than Navigator (just miss seating for 8th person). Sync is way cool. Ride is a good or better than Navigator.,Love to see a fold flat center position seat in middle row to better access third row. 3 wide seating in 3rd row would make this a large SUV killer.
4.625,Flex gets it right,JC ,08/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"We were looking for a larger alternative to my wife's Lexus RX330. Wife wanted more upscale vehicle, but no SUV. Flex is technically not a ""luxury"" vehicle, it gets very close in terms of leather, materials and technology (I am referring to the ""Limited"" model). Interior was in quality to her Lexus RX.  The use of space inside the vehicle is superb, with many functions and useful touches. The seats are extremely easy to fold down for storage. The ride is very nice (better than the Lexus RX). Suspension is soft, but firm enough for good handling. Takes corners better than any SUV, little body roll. A solid vehicle - highly recommend. ","Comfortable seats, lots of storage. Also, this vehicle handles very well. You do not feel like you are driving such a large vehicle. In terms of handling, it is close to a Lexus SUV, and far superior to a Escalade, Mazda, or other SUV.","This vehicle needs a telescoping steering wheel. While it has adjustable foot pedals, the steering wheel is too far away for any driver with long arms or over 6' tall.  Ford doesn't put these in any of their cars for some reason -- must be a safety issue."

Simply put I hated the way this car looked, a cross between a hearse and a bus. My husband insisted I at least look at it, and I admit the inside and its luxurious features got me to test drive... sold! Loaded to the gills at 450/mo for a 39mo lease - the Acadia was at least 75/mo more with less features. (retiree discount helped obviously) I can't get over how I love this car (on the inside and behind the wheel) the outside, not so much. I opted for the white platinum tricoat and really like that I don't have a different color roof! Love it inside, hate it outside - you must drive it!","Split 2nd row, auto fold seating, sync (although I am confused at all it does), ambient lightinf I love and the driver display panel is amazing, tailgate seating is pretty wild too (says my 16 year old) Oh and the 'jukebox' which lets me record my cds to the car itself is the best feature ever made","Captain chairs in row 2 need armrests, headrest in front push head forward.

I now have a loaded SEL. My wife loves it, too! Finally a cool, luxury ride. Yesterday it averaged 27.9 MPG at 60MPH over a ""hilly"" 10 mile highway segment using the cruise control! Wow!

It has by far the best voice recognition system available, and an awesome 12 speaker sony sound system.  With amenities such as supple leather seats, Sirius satellite radio, enough cargo space (when the third row is down) to carry a double stroller and 12 bags of groceries, fuel eficiency (compared to other 7 seater suv's) and eye popping looks, this is an awesome ride.",The Sync voice command system is awesome. It was easy to set up all three of our cell phones (up to 12 can be linked) to the system and it even downloads your address book. The speaker phone is wonderful. The hidden touchpad keyless entry is awesome too.,My only wish is that the rear moon roofs opened up like the front moon / sun roof.  Im sure its that way for a reason (structural support etc.)  
5,Awesome Vehicle,Jeff ,07/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Quite possibly the best American vehicle that I've ever owned.  This vehicle rides smoothly and the AWD version of the vehicle got 24.6 MPG on a long distance trip of 1300 miles. This is 2.6 MPG better than the EPA sticker. The designers of the vehicle seem to have thought of everything including a 110 V AC outlet at the back of the 1st row center console. Must order sync on the vehicle too so that you can make hands free calls (legally required in some states) and also can control your music player or thumb drive with music on it. Seats are amazingly comfortable and ride quality is better than a minivan.  Buy one and you'll be impressed too.,"Sync, ride, 6 speed transmission, fun to drive, high MPG on both highway and city driving, and carries a huge quantity of cargo too.","None, vehicle is perfect."
4.75,Blue Oval is Back,Happy ,07/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Picked our new Flex and we're immediately impressed. The exterior is bold and draws looks that other crossovers wish they could get. The interior is the nicest Ford has produced to date. Plenty of room in all seats even the third row and I'm 6'2"".  Cupholders galore with six passenger seating, great options like auto- folding second row seats ambient lighting and the colors for the exterior. Some may not like the looks of the exterior but the interior is awesome, remember you sit in the car when driving. Give this car some serious consideration in your shopping.","Two-tone paint choices, interior, and the Ford quality.",None to date.
5,Jerry's Flex,jerry ,07/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I love my new Flex. The room is great and so nice to drive. People can not stop looking at it. I was filling and people ask me all about it. Ford hit a home run!,The way all the seats fold down and the low stance the Flex has.,None
4.875,Practical Ford!,new to ford! ,06/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I got my dark ink blue 09 Ford Flex SEL AWD with every option except navagation ( not available on the SEL) for $29500. I love the interior room and luxury features of this vehicle. My kids love the rear refrigerator console in the back to keep their snacks and drinks from going bad. I really like the blue and camel interior that go well together. Has a good stereo system especially with cd's but bass punch is lacking. The 265 hp 3.5l V6 and six speed automatic deliver decent power and pulls from a stop. accelerator response is good and can keep your foot slightly on the pedal. The six speed shifts smoothly but when the car is floored, there is a loud roar. Overall very good vehicle","All the options, rear refrigerator console, vista sunroof, color combination, powerful engine, smooth ride, overall good vehicle","Subwoofer, higher quality plastics, lower engine noise when stepped on, easier to park"
