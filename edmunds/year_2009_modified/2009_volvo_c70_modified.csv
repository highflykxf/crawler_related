3,2009 Volvo C70 T5 Convertible,oak7 ,03/13/2014,3,3,5,,,4,5,5,5,,,"This was my first review: ""I have had my C70 for two months. Most of that time the weather has been nasty - snow, cold, wet, with a few days of nice weather (Typical pre-spring in Alabama). So far I love it. Drives great, comfortable (54 miles one way commute) with plenty of power. Car has 110,000 miles and I have had to replace an axle and wheel bearing but it's good now. Awesome looks and very unique. Car has plenty of room inside and four adults have ridden comfortably, though getting in and out takes a bit of practice. Love my C70.""I still love the car but not the reliability I guess. It has cost us over $2,000 on tires, front end and the rims being bent when hitting a pothole, etc.  When it runs it is good but when something ""breaks"" it is costly. Not sure I'd get another one based on our history with this one. Still loving the hard-top convertible though.",,
4.5,This Car Relaxes Me,miabchdave ,04/19/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"This car will make you want to cruise, listen to good music, and enjoy the scenery.  I find it very comfy.  The trunk room and rear seats have no other competition in the hard top convertible space.  The interior storage is definitely adequate. Those three main reasons are why I went with the C70 over the BMW 328i hardtop even though the lease on the BMW worked out to be $10 cheaper a month.  It's simply a more 'usable' car... it's even rated to tow!  The car does have some oddities that need to be addressed, though.  See below. ","Radio, comfy seat, room for 4... really... if you have friends... this is the only choice so far, Turbo provides good acceleration once the auto finds its gear.  If you're into it, looks are VERY good... no bad angles (lots of thumbs up and I just got it).  Buttery smooth.",Break pedal is too close to the accelerator.  Do they have narrow feet in Scandinavia?  This is almost a safety hazard as the edge of your shoe can get stuck under the break pedal when lifting off the accelerator... BAD for quick stops. Power in center console needed. Flapping rear belts in wind.
4.625,"FUN, FUN, FUN!!!!",fragglerock414 ,04/02/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I bought the car a couple of days before Thanksgiving.  After 4 months I can honestly say that I love this car. I also own a 2002 Volvo S60.  I have always like the C70, but was concerned that I wouldn't really use it as a convertible, which would be a huge waste of money.  Worries are gone.  I can't keep the top up.  I should be arrested for indecent exposure!  This car is so much fun, handles well, is beautiful, and has great features.  The integrated Bluetooth is awesome and works well even with the top down on the highway.  Also love the integrated iPod.  The only drawback is the horrible gas mileage and small (compared to my S60)gas tank.","The integrated Bluetooth, truck access with top down, hard top convertible.","High miles per gallon, please!"
4.5,Beautiful Car Inside and Out,Magic BlueOne ,02/01/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"First off, I enjoy just looking at my C70, it is a beautiful car. Its handling, breaking and acceleration are all capable, so for my intended purpose of top down cruising it is a pleasure. For the reality as a daily driven commuter work horse the Northeast its proved both comfortable and reliable, and the hard top is a necessity. Its a sedan when I need it, a convertible when I want it. Nice job Volvo.","Its a convertible that looks great with the top up or down. The interior design is neat, tidy, attractive and easy to use.",The Blue Tooth has been problematic. 
3.5,Way behind the Technology,Steve ,12/23/2009,,,2,4,4,4,,3,4,3,4,"The looks are great, inside and out. Ride is comfortable, especially the highway driving I do. Handling is a little mushy. The car is quiet as a hardtop, top up, not bad, top down. Seats are incredibly comfortable and definitely recommend the sovereign leather. Technology is embarrassing. The Navigation is like a built is Garmin. The phone is HORRID; very few phones are compatible, and any time I have tried to upgrade phone software, won't sync to the phone book. The other problems are the gas pedal is 1-2 inches lower than the brake pedal, which is awkward, and the Climate Control is weak. After 6 months, I'm going to see if I can trade it if I can do it without losing too much money","Looks, comfort, seats","All the tech, especially the phone, align the pedals better, get a better Climate Control"
4.75,"bravo, Volvo",seye ,08/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Purchased my black C70 in August.  My initial impressions are great.  I wasn't expecting Vette performance, so acceleration/ handling are adequate. No shudders/creeks in the body top up or down.  Exterior design is beautiful-  by far the most attractive Volvo.  Interior also designed well-- drivers seat is comfortable and very adjustable.  Chose standard sound system and I am pleasantly suprised by the acoustics.  Both the iPod and Bluetooth interface are awesome.  Some of the interior bits and surfaces could be of a higher quality (dash, wheel, door trim).  The key is cumbersome, and I wish I'd opted for keyless with this car.  Overall, I love the versatility and design.","appearance inside and out, iPod interface, driver seat comfort and adjust ability",some higher quality interior materials/finishes.  Key is cumbersome
4.75,first full month of ownership,houston ,08/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,C70 is a beautiful car that exceeds my expectation of how livable a convertible can be.  The folding top is a marvel to see in operation and the interior is Scandinavian simplistic.  This car speaks of adult sophistication.,Waiting for the weather to get much nicer so that I truly enjoy the open top experience.,"More thigh support, soften the driver side door pull since my knee keeps rubbing the metal finish trim, and lighten the door for easier access since the doors are longer than standard."
4.75,Perfect Ladies Convertible,Shelly ,07/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"While not up to the performance of a BMW, this car is smooth as silk.  Acceleration and handling in normal driving are very good.  The hardtop works amazingly well.  It is quiet with the top down.  You can actually listen to music with the top down at 70 MPH or have a conversation. The seats are supportive and comfortable even for my husband at 6'2"" and 230LBS.  The car looks great with the top up and fantastic with the top down.  No fooling around with a cloth top or boot.  Sound system is quite good and I just have the standard one.  I can listen to music with top down just fine. This is not a car for a sports car enthusiast, but for me going to the golf course and work it is just great.","Hard Top, Smooth handling, quiet engine, styling, acceleration and handling in normal driving, Blue tooth phone connection, Great trunk for a convertible. 5 speed automatic transmission is very smooth","Better gas mileage, more interior storage (the glove box is a joke), lack of a spare tire. Other than that everything is fine"
3.625,c 70 weak frame and roof,frank ,07/24/2009,,,3,5,3,2,,4,4,4,4,Good experience driving top down but not when the top is up. It generates too much rattles from plastic panel door and roof,,"Make stiffer the frame, it is a disaster and a lot of rattles from the roof"
5,It is fun to drive again,cthimes ,07/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I just purchased this vehicle last week and love everything about it.  I am a big man and fit in the vehicle just fine.  It is a great car to show off and certainly gets everyone's attention when it changes.  My kids have named the car after Jazz in the Transformer movie because it really is a noticeable change.  I like the feeling of security that the car brings and I am very pleased with the performance.  The car has plenty of power actually more horsepower than the V6 Mustang convertible that I was also considering. It really is two cars built into one.,Keyless entry is an awesome feature.  it is kind of strange to not have to worry about doing anything to open or start the car.  The sound system is GREAT.  I am hearing some portions of tracks that I swear I have never heard before and it is so clear even when turned up all the way on an open road.,I cannot think of anything.
5,Just purchased this vehicle and I love i,Cthimes ,07/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I purchased this vehicle after reviewing several others including the V6 Mustang convertible.  I am pleased with the quality and luxury of the design.  The nav system is relatively simple and intuitive.  The audio system is excellent.  The aggressive ability of the acceleration is wonderful.,Nav and audio are both great.  Like the hands free key.,Have not had enough time yet but wanted to post a review since I accessed this website for information.
5,A FUTURE CLASSIC,jack ,07/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Wonderful 6 speed transmission, fantastic premium sound system, somewhat Rare, not too many on the road. A joy to own and drive...","Great MPG on Reg. Fuel, Quality of Build, Style.",Key should be smaller
4.75,BOM BOM POW!,MYVOLVOC70 ,07/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I am a loyal Volvo customer and have owned a Volvo since 2001.  My latest purchase exceeds my expectation.  The car has a well thought out design both inside and out.  The ""tranformer"" like hardtop puts on a fun show.  My car is smooth as silk.  And the bass on the audio is awesome.   The turbo has a nice punch and you can pick up speed pretty well, but I don't think I will be drag racing this car.   The room in this car for a convertible is surprising and even my over 6ft men in my life have leg room.   The safety features that Volvo has included along with that smooth ride makes you feel safe and secure even with the top down. ","The sound system is superb.  We like that you can customer set the surround sound.  The speakers in the back seat ""tickle your bottom"" if the song has a strong base.  This car is meant for cruising!  The design of the valet key is SMART.  I LOVE THIS CAR!  ",More glove compartment and back seat storage would be nice.  Would like to have consistent pick up once you hit 45 mph...it feels like the turbo looses a little of its spunk at 45 mph.   
4.875,Perfect car (cars),Larry ,07/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Like 2 cars in one- coupe and convertible- Beautiful looking- great interior-very comfortable- fun to drive- people stop to watch the top go up and down- No problems in over a year- and best of all it gets the highest safety ratings unlike BMW which I eliminated because of its safety ratings- Love theVolvo,everything about the car,
4.375,Head Turning Convertible,Gilbert Rivera ,06/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,3,4,"As a life-long Honda lover this is my first Volvo.  The fit and quality sold me on the vehicle. Love the top fold- down, and the trunk space for a convertible.  Best feature: DynAudio stereo, great sound and bass. The car turns heads with the top is down.  Got 24K miles on the car and no problems. Two gripes: 1. Pirelli tires a (18 in. wheels) don't last beyond 30K miles (cost $300 a pop). 2. Navigation system stinks.  An address has to be manually entered.  No voice activated features (like my Honda). For a premium brand this is a surprise. ",DynAudio Stereo,Fix the navigation software; add voice activation.  Increase gas tank size by a couple of gallons.  Tank is inadequate for long trips.  
4.5,Love it to death!,majajh ,06/18/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,We absolutely love this car. Wonderful to ride in this thing.,hardtop convertible,Bigger cup holders.
4.125,Professional Convertible,PJ ,05/30/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,3,5,4,3,"As a VW driver for years, I talked myself out of another VW when my last lease expired. I do like my C70 and find it stylish, but I miss the zip of my 4cylinder turbo charged VW Passat.I test drove an Eos in my search for a new car, and bowed out due to unsteady feeling of that car. In retrospect, I'd have given this purchase more thought....","The hardtop roof, trunk space is awesome for a convertible",Needs simultaneous artist and song on Sirius
5,The C70 is awesome,Jersey Girl ,05/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The C70 handles beautiful and is fun to drive.  I was very surprised at how large the trunk actually is.  The interior is comfortable and quite.  The blue tooth connection is also a great feature.,The retractable hard-top is great.  Operates quickly and looks so much better than a rag-top convertible.,So far I love everything about the car.
4.75,Unique and Beautiful,Pete ,04/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"   Excellent exterior and interior styling; interior is understated and straightforward with intuitive controls.  Trunk and backseat are both surprisingly roomy (best in class) for a retractable hardtop.  Roof function is smooth and quick.    Low-end torque is a little weak, but the turbo makes for a zippy little passer once it is underway.  Fuel economy is great.  This car is a well- kept secret, making it pretty unique.  ",Styling. Fantastic sound system. Big trunk and backseat. ,The key!  I hate having a grapefruit in my pocket.  Please Volvo...make the stupid key a little smaller.
5,A blast to drive!,Ken ,04/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Smooth handling and head-turning style go hand-in-hand in my 2009 Volvo C70. On a recent trip to Southern California, the C70 averaged 32.6 mpg. The car has plenty of low end acceleration and if one is not careful, it can creep up to 75-80 (or faster) mph very quickly. Interior styling, while conservative, is ergonomically sound. When the metal top is lowered, people stand and stare as the jigsaw puzzle neatly tucks into the trunk. For a convertible, the C70 does not disappoint in adequate trunk space. I carted two full sized reptile tanks and two pieces of luggage with no difficulty. Compared to an Audi A4 or BMW 3 series (both more expensive), the C70 holds its own very nicely!","Broad shouldered styling,a dynamic audio system, and the slick folding roof design should keep any convertible lover happy. Handling is another strong feature of the Volvo C70. Also, the C70 runs nicely on regular unleaded.","The wind deflector should not have to be purchased as an accessory.  The rear turn signals need to be vertically increased in size.  Cream colored leather seats are fine, but the accompanying white floor mats show dirt and grime immediately. Charcoal colored mats would have been a much better idea."
4.75,Fun convertible,Fin ,03/11/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Smooth as silk when shifting this manual 6 speed. Excellent interior headroom, not a claustrophobic feeling like some front windshields give you in convertibles. The hardtop splits into three pieces which still allows for excellent storage in the boot.",Huge trunk. Smooth 6 speed shifting. Nice dolby speakers,"A little more storage space in the glove box, ability to view artist and song simultaneously on satellite radio"
