1,HUNK OF JUNK,Al Carl ,04/12/2016,,1,,,,,,1,3,,,"I purchased my 2009 Tiguan used in 2012 and it only had 20k miles on it.  Now I'm pushing 90k miles and sadly I still owe 6K.It all started in September when the timing chain mysteriously jumped, basically destroying the top end of the motor.  The VW dealership fixed all that for 5.3k.  I complained so loudly to VW of America they actually sent me a check for 2K because they know their car is a lemon.  Even the guys at my dealership in Topeka, Kansas are saying ""oh yes, these Tiguan engines have a lot of problems""  Thanks Captain Obvious!6 weeks after that disaster the transmission fluid cooler springs a leak, draining all the fluid, and destroying the transmission.  No dash lights came on!  That was another 25 hundred including a deal on a junk yard tranny and a hook up with a local mechanic, not the dealership.I tried to get VW of American to pony up some money to help with the transmission.  Their response:  ""We made one good will payment for the last problem, we won't be doing it again.""Now there's an oil leak.  Dave at VW & BMW of Topeka tells me that the crank case vent valve went bad causing the rear main seal to blow out spewing oil all over the undercarriage of the car and on any parking spot I use.  That's another 18hundred.  Not under warranty.  A terrible car.  A bad experience.  Never VW again.  Ever.",,

1,DO NOT BUY A TIGUAN!!MONEY PITS,whitney ,04/01/2016,1,3,3,,,1,1,3,3,,,"I purchased this car used a month ago and I wish I  did my homework before buying this car.We have owned it for little of a month and have put in $1100 for a seat belt sensor and now it is again at vw for breaking down on us for a time chain that broke that was fixed 10 months ago.Time Chains are very expensive and should last well over 100,000 miles on a car not 8,000 miles 10 months ago.I have owned many vw and this one is unbelievable.I will never again buy a vw very unhappy with vw of america and vw customer service.We have owned it for a month and have already put well over $4000 into it.",,

4,16 Months of Funs,Phil ,03/31/2016,4,4,3,,,4,,4,4,,,"I bought this car with just over 60,000 miles and it now has 75,000 miles on it, so I thought I would chime in here.   So far this has been a great car, and after about $1,000 in maintenance since I've owned it, it seems like it will be good to hit the 100,000 mark, like many of the other 2009 Tiguans for sale around Northern VA right now.   It's a really fun car to drive, and I keep my Acura TL in the driveway on most days now.   It has breezed through two state inspections.  We love the larger, optional sunroof.   It turns on a dime and is so much quieter than our 2012 Subaru Outback and my previous small SUV, a 2001 Mazda Tribute that the Tiguan replaced as our  ""3rd"" car.  The styling is somewhat timeless too -- when I got it in late 2014, my co-workers and neighbors thought it was a brand new car! The only real con is no bluetooth -- although it does have the phone icon on the steering wheel -- and it does have an aux in, so there's that.  I did have a pesky EPC light come on intermittently, which cost about $600 to fix, so that was the bulk of the expense over 16 months.  The local VW dealer has been good, even though I didn't buy the car there.",,

3,Be Cautious & Do your homework,Ms Shay ,03/08/2016,3,3,3,,,3,3,4,4,,,If you're interested in the Tiguan I strongly suggest you make sure the models are 2012 and above b/c anything later seems like the ball was dropped on mechanical issues and wasn't addressed until the reproduction of the later models i.e. rear main seal or coolant hose. Due to my consecutive visits majority of the dealership knows me by name and face,,

1,Some of these reviews are like looking in a mirror,Afiah A. ,11/06/2015,1,1,3,,,1,5,2,5,,,"If at all you are on the fence about this car, hope off the fence and go in another direction. Up until about 82,000 this car was great, some minor interior wear and tear, but I attributed that to having kids. Well in on year, I have replaced my lights four or more times, my intake manifold and pumps have been replaced, and my entire door latch system has been changed on the drives side door. In all, this year alone this car has cost me over 3000. I am floored. When I had a note on this car, I did not even spend that in total.  Every day I now get in the car and pray no dash lights come on, and the car just drives. Owning this car is pushing me to begin looking for another car, and definitely not another VW. I feel this car is made of glorified plastic. I see VW on the road from the late '80's and early '90's. I am so dismayed as to why my vehicle isn't hanging on. Had I been given just a glimpse into the future with this car, I would have chosen a Toyota or a Honda.",,

3,Great if you only want to lease it but donâ€™t keep,mike z ,10/16/2015,1,1,4,,,,2,3,5,,,"I have a 2009 Tiguan. It was a great car until it hit 55,000 miles. First the Freon leaked out due to a faulty pressure switch. A few months later the check engine light came on indicating a cylinder misfire. Dealer said it was due to carbon on the valves and it needed an $800.00 service. Shortly after that the front crankcase seal went. Total for the 2 repairs $1423.11 for a car with 66,000 miles on it. From reading other comments on the internet this is a common occurrence for this vehicle.",,

I am so sad to get rid of this car. It is stylish and performs, but I have poured more than $4k into in in 3 years and I am now facing needing to replace the engine because there is no compression.

1,My best driving car ever... but I can't keep it,Daryl N. ,09/19/2015,2,3,4,,,1,4,5,4,,,"I love driving this car... I've even posted glowing reviews on Facebook about how great it drives on the open highway, on twisting roads, and in the city.   But, at 89,000 miles, I've spent more money on maintenance than I spent in 250,000 miles on my last car, a Toyota Camry.     Unfortunately, the tales of woe on Edmunds seem to be true....  replaced the intake manifold, replaced a door handle, had many lights burn out, replaced water pump, thermostat, and cooling fans.   And a few other things.    Check engine light is glowing about 20% of the time.     I'm very sad about needing to give up on this car, but I can't imagine the coming problems if I hold onto it.    It might work out OK for those who drive fewer miles but I need my car for some long distance trips.   Ultimately, reliability trumps performance.      VW really needs to deal with this.     I'll never buy another one.",,

OK, no biggie, $50 co-pay and i'm good to go. Next, the car starts to overheat when the AC is on. I bring it in, they can't find anything wrong, I drive it, it gets hot, I bring it back, etc. Eventually they replace one of the fans. Then the other fan. Then the water pump, then the radiator. OK, that seems to do it. But then, what is that moldy smell and why is there an inch of water on the floor boards? OMG, there is mold growing under all of the floor mats.

Also felt the handling was above average.

I wish VW would have worked out these issues before coming out with the N.A version of this car.

I will try to list them all to help others.

Â• some leakage in hoses
Â• clean up of carbon buildup that I was advised to do for the car to run smoother.

Â• An electrical problem due to a short from the wiring with the throttle.

Â• A spark plug misfire problem due to oil leaking

Took a road trip in June through the Rocky mountains and got awesome fuel economy! Winter driving we swap out our 18inch rims for 16inch aluminum ones with Gislavid winter tires (from Finland) and can plow through snow that the bottom of the chassis is dragging on.

Sure, the service teams get it taken care of and paperwork is smoothed over.Driving it out of the dealership on Day 1 was pure bliss, but one seriously short-lived.

5,The cutest CUV around,T ,02/24/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Love x 100. We looked at the Rav4, CRV, before deciding on the Tiguan. We have the SE with upgraded seats, pano roof, etc. Looks great, drives great with the fun, peppy 2.0T engine. The suspension seems sporty, so it might be too stiff for some people. We get great MPG (averaging around 28MPG combined!). Seats are comfy & the roof is gorgeous. Interior is great - typical VW quality, lots of storage space too (esp. compared to VW's sedans). Good leg room in the back & plenty of space in the front. Cargo space is a little limited when compared to other CUVs, but it's more than adequate for us and the rear seats fold down easily. Haven't done anything but basic maintenance so far. ","multifunction display, panoramic sunroof, exterior design (reminds me of a RC with the funny little antenna in the back!), comfy seats, 2.0T engine found in Audi models","Leatherette/V-tex should've been standard on SE model, maybe more cargo room to compete with the other CUVs, requires premium gas (but we get better mileage with it, so it's a decent trade-off)"

After years of driving ""luxory"" AWD vehicles I was looking to simplify ... but didn't want to sacrifice the quality I had grown accustomed to.  The SEL Tig was a perfect fit ... simple interior but top notch quality (no cheap plastic dashboards here), comfortable, tight as a drum, good Nav, incredible sunroof, and no real lack of ""toys"" (bluetooth, backup camera, etc.).

Bad sensor in trans, missing parts under front end, gas pedal got stuck under center console trim (VW has no answer on this one, almost killed us!) Power window modulator failure, doors that do not close correctly, and the list goes on.  We do not use the panoramic sunroof as it has failed twice and the dealership claims it is fine... okay, right on!  Many issues come and go, and it is horrible in the cold and all around a clunker!

Great performance, excellent braking /handling, and fantastic ride.  Gas mileage could better, but I have a bit of a heavy foot. Elderly friend said it was smoother and quieter than her Lincoln.

4.5,6 Month Review,NMar ,10/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,3,5,"After researching what kind of SUV I wanted, I decided on the Tiguan. Happen to be in Florida on vac, they had a good deal, I bought and drove the car to New York. Drive was a lot of fun. Vehicle seems solid, firm ride. I get asked about it by passerbys. Brake is very responsive, quite interior. Some minor issues I do have: motorized driver reclining seat, but manual pump lever to elevate and move seat..why not motorize all, summer humidity seems to bring out a bad smell from air exhaust when it's not on a/c, engine is powerful, but there seems to be a delay in responsiveness when u go from braking to quickly accelerating, but then it eventually picks up when you press harder on the pedal","I like the interior and exterior look, Good quality interior finish even with the cloth option, 6 mo free satellite radio, firm ride, minimal road noise, sturdy roof frame construction. SE was the better option for me since it came with many standards.","Motorize all driver seat adjustment, not just back support. Do same on pass side. I need to investigate unpleasant humidity smell. I do wish the rear luggage compartment is a bit larger. Also, need to improve gas mileage a bit more. I do get 22mpg city which is ok, I guess."

The car is great in city and hwy and I'm amazed at how well it insulates outside noise. Feels very solid throughout. I agree with some comments about the black upholstery, it is a hair magnet.

Took car back to find lights were ill- positioned. 6 months later I had to get the fuel pump replaced. Already had to get burned out drivers head lamp replaced and there is an awful squeek inside that I can't seem to find/fix. I like the car but am wary about what to expect in year 2.

I sold my 9 year old Camry and do not miss it one bit (it was very reliable but BORING, yet the gas mileage was great).  I can't rate the reliability yet, but so far I am very pleased, and no real quality issues to address, but I do agree that the Turbo is rather jerky at times and leaving from a stop light turning right it is jerky accelerating to get going, almost like I am driving a stick in a low gear (which I do not have the manual, and I have no need or desire to use the shifting option). The dealer really came down on the sticker price - I got the pricing below a comparable Honda CRV/or RAV4. ","The Cabin is very quiet which I love.  Very peppy, fast and fun.

Love the same features of the Land Rover, but disappointed about the room inside.  I have (2) dogs and cannot fit much else except them.  Also cannot get over the fact there are no armrests in the middle, having to use the console seems odd.  Also just ran over a nail on one of the tires and have to have it replaced.  The 18"" Pirelli's that are on the Tiguan are on national backorder - odd sized tire as well.  Not sure if they are good snow tires from what I have researched on the Pirelli website.

I thought I would get a CRV, but the power isn't there and there are far too many on the road.  I wanted to like the Acura RDX as an Acura TL owner.  While I liked it, the gas mileage (poor) and cost (high) prevented the deal.  The Ford Escape Hybrid just didn't have the fit and finish.

The steering freaked me out a bit at first but I'm getting used to it. I don't understand why at times it feels disconnected from the car. It does drive like a car and I like the boost from the turbo engine.

Overall I'm happy with this car.","Back seats slide forward up to 6"" which may not seem like a lot but it really is when you need it.  This car can get up and go.  Has the same engine as my husbands 2006 GTI.","Gas mileage.  I'm fine with having to use premium in it if I could get a trade off with miles per gallon, 18mpg (city) is not cutting it.  "

4.75,Most fun to drive CUV under $35K,newjerseyguy ,04/13/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"It's no GTI, but for a CUV it is the best out there in its price range. Handling and composure on all road surfaces is excellent.  Not skittish like the RAV4 V6, and better gas mileage than the Acura RDX. Fit and finish is better than the Honda CRV. Comfortable and quiet interior, controls are simple and in the right places. The 2.0T motor is smooth and refined with plenty of kick when you need it. And don't be put off by the high MSRP as large discounts can be had.  Flemington VW was awesome, with no pressure and knowledgeable salespeople.","Handling/ride balance.  Smooth engine and the comparatively slick 6 speed automatic transmission. Simple controls, panoramic sunroof, and seat heaters (with cloth seats) are nice interior features.",TDI engine as gas mileage could be better and the 2.0T likes premium gas. Longer bumper to bumper warranty - the 3 year free maintenance deal currently offered is a bit of a joke since we are talking about 3 oil changes.

I researched cars for about 6 months prior to test-driving and this was one of my top pics.

For me, it was this or a CRV, and the deal I received from VW just crushed what Honda was willing to do.  Sticker on my SE was 29,115.  Final purchase price was 25,604.  Both of the preceding figures are pretax.  I put $2000 down and financed the remainder @ 0% for 60 months.  Honda thought I was making stuff up, $3600 off MSRP plus 0% for 5 years. VW is definitely trying to move inventory, I guess Honda isn't desperate enough yet.  I absolutely love the vehicle though, but I've only had it for a week so reliability is tough to judge at this point.  Absolutely zero buyer's remorse to this point.","Sunroof, engine, fit & finish (very impressive), exterior styling versus the competition, quiet ride & cabin","Maybe a tad larger cargo area (about the only real shortcoming versus the CRV), but I knew this going into the deal"

Manual transmission and higher ingress/egress makes this fit my desire for fun and my need for comfort.  Would have preferred a manual transmission with the ability to also have nav, sunroof, heated seats and AWD, but VW did not give me that option.  I have found base 'S' model's cloth seats do not get as cold as leather seats so I have not yet gone to the aftermarket for heated seats.  It is more quiet than my BMW and Chevy Tahoe.  It tracks well and has lots of storage cubbies, including a hidden one to the left of steering wheel.  Drawers under the seats like the European models would have been nice. Bring on the TDI with a stick!","Auto Hold feature is great for teaching my daughter to drive a stick.  All controls are intuitive to use and right where they should be.  Smooth manual transmission is great, but the power and handling is what sold me.  Came down to  2009 Subaru Forester or Tiguan and VW was just more fun to drive.","Make the ""VW"" logo on hatch the opener like on the GTI and Rabbit.  TDI would be perfect.

Very sure-footed in this slop, & a real hoot to drive.  The kids love the panoramic moon-roof... it is about as much exposure one can have to the sky without getting a convertible.   The Tiguan's Xenon headlamps have peripheral sidelights which activate and illuminate the sides of the road whenever you make a turn.  Very nice to have on twisting roads, sharp corners, dark parking lots, city streets, etc.  The Tiguan is also a very quiet car for the small SUV/CUV segment.  No  high pitched whine & road-noise like I experienced with the Toyota RAV4 and CRV.     ","The interior and exterior fit & finish is flawless & well thought-out.  No confusing & gratuitous console arrays of knobs or clunky plastic buttons that plague other cars in this segment.   Controls are clean, functional, & exactly where they should be.  The back seat compartment is cavernous.","I really can't think of any.  Perhaps more thigh-support in the front seats.   The Tiguan has the best NAV system on the market so if you like this type of electronic, get it.   The 4-Motion is a great ski-car.

The style is still cool and I don't regret one thing about this car. The quality is great, the ride is smooth, and its still fun for me.

Great vehicle and I broke a personal cardinal rule about buying a car the first year it's offered because I was so impressed with it.  The rear-view camera didn't work but the techs at my local dealer found a loose connection behind the radio. They rebuilt the connection and it works just fine. There is also some wind noise from the roof rails. There is plenty of room and comfort front and back and the acceleration & handling is fantastic. We'll see how the mileage works out as it breaks in over the next month or so,What's not to love?  Will post more as we get used to the car.,"-Offer SEL options as an upgrade for SE models - leather, power seats, etc. -Provide Volk'l hands free phone system as standard with the premium sound system, especially if you're paying for the NAV.

The transmission is smooth and the turbo gives you that needed boast in passing or that extra acceleration you need when youÂ’re entering a busy highway, and beats out all the competitors when it comes to acceleration.  A little pricey, but the Tiguan S isnÂ’t badly priced considering all the standard features and the quality of the build.  The interior is nicely done and has actual aluminum trim vice the aluminum looking plastic you find in the competitors.  DidnÂ’t ever care for the color red, but the Black Cherry Metallic (which I purchased) is exceptional.","2.0 Turbo, transmission, radio, and looks.",Put Leatherette seats in the S and SE versions instead of the cloth.

Drives and rides very good plus the 2.0 gives good acceleration when merging on the highway. The roof was not on the wish list but is a nice feature. Spent hours researching all the other competitors models and felt this Tiguan stood out. So far only one gas fill up and was mainly city driving, gas mileage to be determined.

I'm only 21 but I do my research & I wasn't about to blow my money and money that my grandma had given me for a car. It came down to a Vue 08 or a Tiguan the Vue was roughly $4000 cheaper but after long nights of thinking about the reviews on this website on the vue and the tiguan I decided to get the tiguan & bought one on 9/12/08. I'm so glad I made the right choice it is so much fun to drive and so far I have only had one problem which is the sat. radio & it has nothing to do with vw it is some technical issue with Sirius that is supposed to be fixed in a week..I really have nothing but good things to say. Great SUV! I will write an updated review later,"the sunroof is amazing..the easy control buttons. steering wheel buttons, the bench seat in the back that can fold down and push forward for extra trunk room and the peppy 4 cyl. engine..to many favorite features to list",the only suggested improvement is to have blue tooth standard on all models. and all way powered driver seat

After hearing everyone here rave about the sunroof I kinda wish I would've bought the next trim level up, but it was a little pricier. Also I think the bigger wheels look better. Fuel economy is good for this size vehicle, but if they ever bring the TDI version, that will be awesome... I don't know what the MPG would be on that, but the TDI Jetta gets close to 44 MPG!

However, nothing comes close to German style and especially the interior comfort and technology. My favorite feature is the sunroof which allows for a very nice view of the sky for both front and rear passengers. The gas mileage is respectable compared to the Mercury Mountaineer I traded in. The response to the accelerator is also respectable. ",I decided to get the leather because I had problems with my last VW's leather chaffing and peeling. You gotta love the heated seats VW and Audi offer. Slick front end which classy chrome trim make is easy on the eyes. I also like how the rear seats recline and can be adjusted for more foot room.,Improve the looks of the back end. The rear lights could be a little more bold and not bland. The rear middle seat needs to fold down into a bigger arm rest. I think VW can do better with designing that.
