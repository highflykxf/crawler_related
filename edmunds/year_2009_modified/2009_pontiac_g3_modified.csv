5,Awesome little car!,Sil Rom ,08/18/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I've had it since August 2009. It only had 14 miles, when I got it. It now has a little over 52K and its has never been at the dealer except for oil changes and two alignments! It's due for a tune up this month... It still runs great! About 270 to 300 miles per tank of gas! Best car I've ever had, and I will keep it for as long as I can! üöó‚ù§Ô∏è",,
1.875,Cheap unreliable car,chente1 ,04/22/2013,,,2,3,1,1,,2,3,1,2,"My wife got this car new on a emergency.( Cheap and need it a car right away). Since she got it, it had problems with the electrical system. She took it to the dealer several times but they always give her excuses not to fix it, even thoug it was under guarranty. Car have 80000 miles and already need it a new tranny and radiator, which GM didn't want it to fix, even thoug it was under warranty, 100,000 miles power train.($5500.00 repair) at this point, the A/C is acting up, even thoug we took it to the dealer before the end of warranty, but they didn't want to fix it. So now we have a car with bad sensors ( four total at $150.00 a piece) plus airbag and tire sensors all acting up. Thanks GM!",None,"There is not place for improvement since GM stop making Pontiac, and even thoug they told my wife she could have the asurence that they would deal with any issues, this is not been the case. At least the transmission job was cover by GM, but only after the dealer that we took the car covince theme to do so.( Not the ORIGINAL dealer that we took it). My suggestion if you have the same car, connect the transmission lines to a separate cooling system or it will be a spensive repair."
3.375,Well...it's a cheap car,axle2152 ,04/12/2012,,,4,5,4,3,,2,4,3,2,"I bought my G3 in August of 2009. I currently have 71,100 miles. I have not had any mechanical problems, however I have 2 camshaft position sensors go bad. This causes the car to sputter and lose power and causes a lot of jerking which is bad for the transmission. The ride is a little rough, about what you would expect in a sub-compact. Power is a joke, 12 seconds to 60 MPH, and fuel economy could be better, and other cars in it's class (from the same year model) get better gas mileage and still have better performance. On-Star never worked from the start and the dealership gave me the run around about fixing it, so it never was, not that I would subscribe to a nonsense service anyway.","Power Windows pretty handy in a cheap car, CD/MP3 player and exception FM reception with static reduction. Can easily tune in FM stations 80+ miles away in clear stereo. Very good head lights, decent Air Conditioning, surprisingly good heater for a small engine. Seats are reasonably comfortable, even on longer drives, however we'll discuss comfort shortly. One of the few cars today that still have an ashtray and cigarette lighter, also has an extra 12V outlet between driver and passenger.","Better electronics. While the car is mechanically sound and proven reliable, some electronic/computer related issues have arisen (thankfully) during the warranty period. The factory stereo has 180 watts of power, however the 6 1/2"" speakers cannot handle bass due to lack of cabinet volume which results in distortion, even at low volumes, I would recommend a small sub-woofer to improve sound quality, and it won't take much to do the trick. I'm 5'9"" and my knee is right against the center console and becomes notably uncomfortable on long trips. I would suggest a engine that can deliver more torque at lower rpm's to give better performance at highway speeds."
2.875,"Serios coil, plug and onbard computer problems",g3_neveragain ,12/31/2011,,,4,4,2,1,,4,3,2,3,"DON""T BUY THESE CARS!!!! Yes, they look nicer than the Honda Fit and Yaris, and mine even came with power windows, moon roof, on-Star, sports interior and stylish wheels, BUT it is all show and no substance. The car is not even 3 years old and has had the PCM computer changed (the computer that controls EVERYTHING on the car - and would cost around $1000 if not covered by warranty, the ignition coil changed twice (each costing around $300 if not covered by warranty), and the oxygen sensors changed (each costing around $300 if not covered by warranty). Look online and the problems with the ignition coil, spark plugs and oxygen sensors are commonplace. I WILL NEVER BUY A GM AGAIN. Wake up GM!!",,Do some serious testing of your cars before selling them with problems that are widespread and then deny that the problem exists. Cheap and unreliable parts with fancy looks means nothing. I am going to Japanese cars now - they might not look at flash but at least they will last.
4.5,LOVE MY G3,tonidale ,08/30/2011,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,3,4,"I bought my g3 new july of 09, and love it, i have over 20,000 already have to have new tires :(. other than that i love it, i am a large size woman and when dealer showed me that car i laughed at him and said no way i can be comfy in that car, he proved me wrong. i only had i small thing wrong with it when i fisrt bought it. and since then it has been fine. i don't think i get that great of gas milage. but love the car.",,better tires
4.25,Great car for the money.,bigwillyz ,03/26/2011,,,4,5,4,4,,4,3,5,5,"I've had this car since Sept 2009 and aside from a transmission cooler line not tightend enough at the factory (noticed the first couple of days I had it) I have had no problems. I have over 20,000 miles on it and it runs like a clock. I have not noticed any of the issues noted in other posts but I was dissappointed in the mileage I got out of the OE tires. I have already replaced them and the alignment showed everything was within spec. It's a bit of a rough ride but to be expected in this small of a car. Based on what I paid for this car brand new with full warranty I'm thrilled with it. ","Seat adjustments, mp3 player, ASHTRAY! (I haven't seen an ashtray in cars for years) Lot of room in engine compartment so in a few more years when I have to start working on it I'll have room to do it.","Better OE tires, the visors could be a little more adjustable, folding the rear seats could be a little easier."
2.25,Not a happy camper,Not a happy camper ,11/06/2010,,,3,5,1,1,,1,3,2,2,"I have now had this car about a year in a half! Mind you it's my first brand new car! I thought i picked a great choice for my first new car. Well I was WRONG! My car has been to the shop 8 times! Front end problems pulling me to the left hard, driver side mirror shakes so bad i cant even see out of it when it rains or on im on the high way! Thermostat has gone out. And just yesterday i had to get the heater blower thing fix! I am trading this car in! They will not see me again!nor get my business again! It sucks gas! It doesn't ride smoothly! Worst choice i could have ever made buying that car!! I regret every day of it!",The color orbit blue (changes from blue to purple,If you are going to make a car why dont you drive it for a year before you put it on the darn market! Because now you have some unhappy customers!
2.75,1st time buyer,tcunningham ,02/23/2010,,,4,4,2,1,,2,4,2,3,"I brought this car in Aug 09 and in Sept 09 the 1st accelerator chip was replaced and was assured it would not happen again.  I have had the accelerator chip replaced two times in this car.  Went out on the expressway.  This was my first new car and now I'm scared to drive it.  The car doesn't save me gas because I drive more and fill up at lease 2 to 3 times a week.  The chip will go out without warning while on the highway.  This last time I was almost hit by a truck.  This is not a reliable car, it is almost like a death trap.","The car overall looks good and the interior is good, if you spill something it is easy to clean up and the on-star is good.",
4,2009 Pontiac G3,2009 Pontiac G3 ,01/16/2010,,,4,4,4,3,,4,5,4,4,"I bought this ""used"" with 1200 miles. I now have 3000 miles on it. Like the car - however, having similar issues with the check engine light keeps coming on. In 2 weeks, I have driven the car for 1.5 days. It is BACK at the dealership and they can't figure out why it keeps coming on. Changed coils and wire and not happy that I am driving a G6. I bought the G3 for better gas - but so far, I am spending more money on the loaner car this year than I would've saved keeping my other car. If they can fix this, I will be happy very happy. ",,
4.625,Cheap fun,djehall ,12/26/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,5,5,"Bought this three weeks ago.  I traded in a Nissan Frontier  I wanted better gas mileage and no longer needed a pickup.  My local Pontiac dealer had one left, with every toy I wanted (sunroof, cruise), and toys I didn't know I wanted until I had them (OnStar, XM, lumbar support).  I liked the interior, especially the seats.  Sad that Pontiac is going the way of the DeSoto, but decided to take up GM's offer on remaining Pontiacs.  This is fun to drive, gets good gas mileage, and I'm not worried about finding replacement parts, since it's a rebadged Aveo.  Wife likes it as well, and offered to give me her Jeep Patriot for it (I turned her down).  All in all, a great and easy choice for me. ","Sunroof.  Seats that are actually comfortable.  Fun to drive, compared to the pickup I was driving and the SUVs I have to drive at work.  The sunglasses holder is a nice touch.","Not that it matters now, but  more center console storage would have been nice."
4.875,Nice for what it is.,Small town fool ,12/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Tried to get a Vibe but for the price, this was better.  Great handling and fuel mileage.",Easy to drive,Better cup holders
4.375,just got it,sm ,11/25/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,4,4,4,5,"We needed better gas mileage. I never liked hatchbacks. We were looking at the Corolla, Prius or Civic when the G3 was shown to us. Someone had it for 3 mos and put in an in dash navigation system/sirius radio, etc. We looked at it, test drove it - took it him that night. We just got it, but I really like driving it. Roomier than it looks. ",Fun to drive - love the metallic black - good looking hatchback,
2.5,Very disappointed,BB ,11/02/2009,,,3,3,3,1,,1,3,3,3,Thinking of heading to the Lemon Law on this car...going in for the 3rd time in 6 months for check engine light having to do with the gas vac. canister...Won't take this on any kind of a trip and would like nothing better than to be rid of it...Hate to look at the dashboard when we turn it on.,,
5,have you driven a PONTIAC lately?,Pontifan ,09/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Traded in a '95 Jeep Cherokee for this beauty!  Anything better than 12mpg in town was worth it.  But this car is amazing!  Love the interior, only it needed a full center console for storage.  Love the lumbar support. It really is FUN to drive.  I look forward to going to work every morning just to get in it!  I, too would like to have tinted windows. I'm down south, and it makes a difference. Got it fully loaded for $10,200!!   By the way, I was going to get a g5, but muuuch less head room!  Thanks, Pontiac, for the great car.","FUN, FUN, FUN!!! Lumbar support, comfortable seats, peppy, metallic black paint looks awesome!  Looks better than the Fit or Prius, or the horrible Accent",Center console instead of a tray. Center console instead of a tray! Center console instead of a tray!!

4.625,Low cost transportation,doug casey ,09/21/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,4,5,"I bought this car with the cash for clunkers program, so the price was $7600 and my now crushed Cherokee. The only option I bought was the AC. The first tank of gas I got 32 combined MPG, mostly highway. I am a conservative driver. All I wanted was good cheap transportation, and I am VERY happy with this purchase. If you want a Cadillac, buy a Cadillac. This car rides and handle fine, good headroom, and is kind of cute. The engine RPM seems high on the highway, but it rides good and is not very noisy. If it is reliable for years, I would buy another.","Low Price, comfortable",5th gear could be higher to slow down the engine on the hiway. Maybe the larger tire option would help this.
4,Excellent choice for North America,Eather ,08/31/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,3,4,5,4,"Best car for the money.  Honda, Toyota, and Nissan should be real scared right now.  This car is stellar.  I had no idea Daewoo could make such a great set of wheels at such a low price tag too.  I can't say what reliability is since we only had it for about a month now if that.  We got this car under the cash for clunkers program as a ""bridge"" vehicle until the plug in hybrids come out.  Looks like someone else reviewing this vehicle is doing the same thing as well.",Stereo doesn't switch off when I turn the engine off.  Rear window wiper and washer.  Heated side view mirrors.,Daewoo/GM need to make side view mirrors that don't vibrate from wind and engine vibration.  This car needs a better way to unlock and lock the front doors.  The automatic door locks are not in easy reach.
5,"Green Machine, not a gas guzzlin SUV",Janko ,08/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I'm giving this car a 10 across the board.  I'm doing this with the mindset of my expectations of a compact economy car.  It met my expectations 100%.  I'm 6'6"" tall and cannot believe how comfortable the seats are.  I love this car and it's exactly as I expected.  For the people who rate the performance anything less than a 10, go buy a Corvette.  I had a Honda and am soooo happy I sold it to buy the G3.  No complaints, very happy!!!",Big comfortable seats,Tinted windows because I get so many looks.
3.75,Not a happy camper with the G3 mileage,John ,08/20/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,1,4,I am not satisfied with the gas mileage that I am getting on my new g3. I am only getting 24 in the city and 29 on the highway. The rating on the car when I bought it stated 29 city and 34 highway and in small print at the bottom it stated up to 40 mile per gal.  Well I am not coming close  and I gave up an hhr which was getting 33 per gal. Not a happy camper. I fell like trading it in but would take too much of a hit.,Comfortable seats.,Mileage needs a great deal of work for such a small car. Getting 29 miles per gal highway is not going to cut it.

1.625,Is this a joke?,HUMMER OWNER ,07/23/2009,,,1,1,1,3,,1,1,4,1,"So i have a new 09 Hummer and due to the deteriorating economy the dealership has the G3 as their loaner fleet.  Not a big deal since I anly (cross my fingers) have to drive this thing for a few days...  Honestly GM rebadging a DAEWOO is about as lame as watching TV without TiVo...  how can you people say that you like this gocart with a straight face??? its slower than molasses in winter, about as much sind noise as a motorcycle doin 90 the AC is horrible the seats belong in a john boat, this thing reminds me of cheap toys made in china - when you buy them new do they come in a box with crappy assembly instructions and plastic tools??",the fact that its just a loaner!!  this thing FAILs so well that it could be considered a WIN,
