4,It drives forever,Elijah Meadows ,07/03/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,"My friend got a new car and let me use his 2009 ford escape until I could get a car of my own. It had about 199,000 miles on it when I took over. It wasn't too much longer until the power steering malfunctioned. There was a recall on them apparently but my VIN wasn't included when I called Ford. It made it hard to turn the wheel and especially hard to get in and out of parking spots at grocery stores and such. It's about $700+ to fix the problem. It's at 220,000k miles now and still runs great. Has an oil leak. Had to replace the wheel bearing, brakes and battery in the last year. Other than that it's a great car. Take care of it and keep the oil changed",,

4,6 years and going strong,Texas Chemist ,04/04/2016,5,3,3,,,5,5,4,3,,,"I bought my Escape used in Sep 2010 to replace my 98 Grand Prix. These are the only two vehicles I've ever owned and I've been driving 15 years. The Escape is a challenge to rate for two main reasons: It is extremely reliable, has almost no mechanical issues, is smooth and fluid on the road and provides almost everything I need as far as cargo and transportation goes. On the other hand, it is uncomfortable to sit in. I mean, the seats are not good. In 6 years I've yet to get the seat/steering position perfect. My legs get cramped up or my back starts to hurt a little after only 20 minutes of driving. But this thing is so smooth and nice on the road, the road noise is low (compared to my wife's Civic which is ridiculously loud), and the steering is so soft and fluid you can control the the vehicle with a single finger. Other than some pretty stupid interior design (center stack mainly) and cheap materials, as well as an occasionally jerky transmission the vehicle is near perfect. Pros: - Extremely reliable- Drives very well- Easy to control- Excellent in snow/ice/rain- Great exterior stylingCons:- Jerky transmission when starting from a stop- Horrible interior stying/center stack design- Cheap plastic materials inside- Very uncomfortable seats- Lack of telescoping steering",,

3,No more Ford products,cmrakers ,03/19/2016,2,3,3,,,2,4,3,3,,,"Ok, I've been a Ford supporter for 40+ years, all the while enduring the Chevy, Toyota, Honda owners snide comments.  As of todayI'll never buy another Ford.First, the 1998 F150 XLT airconditioning and electrical system began failing at 40k miles (I didn't keep track of how much those repairs cost) so at 80k I finally traded that in for the 2009 Escape.  The first Escape under warrenty transmission was installed in 2012, and now at 77k miles I'm faced with another failed transmission.  Included in the decision NOT TO BUY FORD is the fact that this Escape cost me about $900 in repairs every freaking year since hitting the 36k warranty mark (sometime in 2013), and I'm good to my vehicles--regular maintenance, don't drive like a maniac.   The new tires will outlast the engine/transmission and that's freaking sad and not cost effective.  I'm switching to Honda or Toyota.",,

2,"Do yourself a favor, don't buy it.",Curt ,01/05/2016,1,3,3,,,2,3,3,4,,,"If there was a lower rating for transmissions I would have given it. This car seems to have a ton of recalls, which the techs like to tell me that Ford is looking out for its customers. I like to view it as, a lot of poor design choices from a company who has been making cars to long. I get being new and innovative, but how about making a car that doesn't have the worst transmission in the world?!? Did they even test the damn thing before they threw it into cars? I realize that all cars have their issues, but this car seems to be the worst I have ever dealt with (don't believe me? just google it).",,

4.625,Awesome little SUV,tugboat95 ,01/16/2015,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I love this truck! I bought this with 33k miles to replace a Durango I could no longer afford to feed.  It was an adjustment to go that small.  I chose the Escape because it had the most interior room of the small SUV's.  I'm 6'5 and I sit comfortably in it for an 8 hour drive twice a month.  I have the XLT V-6.  I get 28mpg round trip on that drive and I see 33 in certain spots where I behave with the throttle. It now has 75k miles on it and the only thing I have touched is the oil and transmission fluid and a new set of tires. Most dependable vehicle I've ever owned.  And it pulls a 3050lbs RV and gets 12mpg doing it.  I've been offroading in WV with it and even just 2wd, it holds its own.",Love the SYNC system.  Easy to drive and park.  handles well on the highway.  Really good on gas and when you punch it the throttle responds very well. First gear has some power to get going and take off. 4-6 gears have good response on the highway.  Adaptive transmission takes about 30 miles to learn it has an RV behind it and makes required adjustments and changes shift points.  Very surprised at how easily it tows my 3000lbs camper.  But 3500lbs is the max and the engine is working really hard but she handles it like a champ.,"Overall the ride is pretty good, but when its loaded with cargo or a trailer the ride gets a little bouncy.  Not sure how this can be improved on such a short wheelbase.  Its not bad, but like all 6'5"" guys a little more legroom is always nice.  I fit,but just barely."

The only issues I have had with the vehicles is with the Fan motor, in which a resister went bad. Otherwise, I have had no issues with either vehicle. The vehicles offered me the features I wanted, with few I did not want. The acceleration, handling, braking were good enough for me. I was impressed with the gas mileages, I topped 32 MPG, door to door, with both vehicles on long trips, a number of times.",The gas mileage.,"The Drum brakes in the rear are a concern to me, though I have not noticed any issues with normal braking.

I bought the car and I thought it needed a blend door motor on the passenger side (~$900) I replaced it and turns out it was a HVAC module (this was free after a letter to the owner of the Ford dealership because they misdiagnosed it the first time). I now have intermittent power steering (~$1500 to fix) This is my biggest issue because it appears to be a safety issue. So if you buy this car beware and have that money ready! Also paint is starting to chip off the top of the liftgate for no apparent reason (only 12 inches is covered by paint anymore)","I love the leather interior, heated seats, moonroof, ambient lighting, satellite radio, bigger than my saturn was ","The steering problem is a common issue and can be dangerous since it is intermittent.

3.5,Good so far.,texaschemist ,03/25/2011,,,3,4,3,4,,3,4,4,3,I bought my Escape used in June 2010.The Escape handles and accelerates well and has an overall powerful feeling. It was after 2 months of routine driving that I noticed the first problems. The transmission would hesitate when accelerating from a stop and jerk into gear. There was no noise and afterward the transmission was smooth. When it started doing this while making left turns through 4-way stops I decided to take it in and have it looked at. Turns out the transmission was failing to downshift from 2nd to 1st quick enough. A technical bulletin fixed this. I've also noticed that my MPG in winter are much worse than summer (2-4 mpg). Otherwise its a great SUV for the value. ,Excellent 4WD response. Great in snow and rain. Quick acceleration. Aesthetic value. Turning and handling responsivness. ,"Transmission leaves something to be desired. Improved computer control of downshifting and accelerator response time.

There's not much we don't like other than the gas mileage & the paint surface is already scratched.

Also glare on tach/speedometer plastic at certain times of day.  Seats are fairly comfortable even though there is no lumbar support offered. Surprised about that.

I think i love my truck so much because i bought it BSN (brand spankin' new) so Im very please. After two trips to the service department my truck was diagnosed with a bad instrument panel which caused Candy (Shes red) spedometer and tachometer to go off by themselves just with the turn of the key and rev up as if you were pressing on the gas, all the way up 120 mph!!

Besides the comfort, the street appeal and the reliability ratings, this FWD,4 cyl. 6 speed trans. is getting nearly 27 mpg! It's only 4 days old and supposed to have even better mileage when broken in.  We live in the Ozarks where it's all mountain driving and the car handles like it was a V6!  There's no road noise and the automatic shifting is effortless.  The front seats are ample and the Sirius music is awesome!

I drove this vehicle off the lot with 100 miles and a bad drivers door seal that leaked and you can hear air whisping by. It didnt worry me much because the waranty would cover the repair. It was taken to the shop the next week and I picked it up four days later. The problem was still not fixed. The next day the check engine light came on. I took it back to the shop they said that the fuel cap seal was not working properly. I took it right bck to the dealership and returned it with 500 miles on it.Ford should have put more time into testing this vehicle before letting it out for consumers to purchase.,Great gas mileage. Fun options. SYNC was great.,Better quality!!!!! Ill never buy another Ford.

Once it got hot and I started running the A/C, the vibration spread to the entire dash.  My passengers could feel it.  It was getting worse and the dealer said all the V4's did it, and they wouldn't do anything to fix it.  ""The car operates in the manner in which it was designed"" was what the service reps and all the Ford reps said.  Eventually the vibration got so bad that the antenna on the passenger side OUTSIDE the car would vibrate with the inside of the car.  Ford said that was normal.  I gave up and traded it in for a Mazda.","leather seats were great, the 6 cd changer and satellite radio was great.",there is no excuse for Ford to let an obvious vibration slide like that.

4.75,Growing Pains,BitterSweet ,07/14/2009,,,5,5,5,3,,5,5,5,5," I have enjoyed driving the Escape, but disappointed in its reliability.   A bad wheel bearing was replaced at 3000 miles. A part for the steering wheel shaft was ordered at the same time.  The airtime/rollercoaster feeling when driving over 'dips' in country roads was unexpected. Removable cup holders and easy to vacuum interior makes upkeep of the interior simple.  Folding down the rear seats is easy, but I have had to search for the seat belts after setting the seats back up.  Currently, 26mpg is it's avg highway mileage, I expect to see this increase with the recent repairs.  Finally, I keep window cleaner in the suv due to significant drop in visability with any dirt on the windshield.

The 2009 has a great 4 cylinder engine that has almost the equivalent power of the 2008 V6, with much better fuel consumption (or should I say conservation).  We average 24 mpg with mostly city driving, and almost 30 mpg on our last all-highway road trip! It does great in the snow and handles the bumpy roads and potholes with ease.  The 4 cyl. doesn't have the fastest acceleration but the mpg more than makes up for that shortcoming (and is to be expected).  Nice amount of storage space and cup holders, plenty of room for all your stuff.  SYNC is awesome - just plug in your iPod/mp3 player and use your voice to control it!",The SYNC technology is the coolest on any vehicle (voice-activated stereo controls as well as cell phone controls).  Ambient lighting (different colors throughout the vehicle) is fun.  Huge center compartment (removable inserts) - could probably fit a large purse/bag in there.,"Seats could be more comfortable. A bit cramped between the armrest and center compartment. Sunroof is really loud when open, there should be a deflector that pops up. SYNC voice is way too loud.

The build quality is horrible. The shut lines on the doors are way to big and inconsistent. I can fit my finger in the one at the top of the back hatch. The rear folding seat design is horrible. The interior is cheap and plastic abundant. The rear window sounds like it is going to fall out. The rear suspension booms over anything but the smallest bumps. The doors don't shut fully unless you slam them. I could go on and on. I can't deny the fact that it gets good gas mileage for an SUV.  ""Drive Quality"" clearly does not apply to the Escape.

But, to my great surprise this is a very peppy SUV and I honestly only notice a difference going up steep hills.  I love the SYNC option (an option I actually could have cared less about when buying this--but--it works flawlessly with my iPod) and the updates to this are great.

So far, I've gotten 26 mpg's but it's still adjusting. I saw where Edmunds said getting the rear seat down was difficult -not so- lift a handle and down it folds. I'm loving the Siris radio that comes free for 6 months. I will subscribe when it runs out. The fit of the car is great. My husband loves it too. I bought this car because when I researched cars on Edmnds, the people who had bought this car gave it such high marks. They were right. No complaints at all. ",I love all the technology located on the steering wheel. I'm not a techy but I'm learning to love it. I love my bluetooth phone-quick note- if you buy this car and your blue tooth doesn't work- it's the phone. Mine was defective so I got a new phone and it worked.

I was impressed by the safety ratings (my number one priority), and liked the safety features available. The SYNC system is great, its easy to see all the way around the vehicle (no blind spots and easy to back up). At 60 mph I get 31 mpg, at 80 mph 25mpg; not bad for an SUV.

The interior is spacious and well thought out, and the seats are comfortable. The buttons on the center console are pretty crowded.

Fuel economy is just as advertised at this point. In traffic-clogged downtown Madison, WI I'm getting 19 mpg. It's much more efficient on the highway however, as it edges towards the advertised 26 mpg. Sunroof is a particularly great addition in this car. Really opens up the car. Light interior also makes the car open up ""bigger""","Sync, Comfortable soybean-based seats, sunroof, powerful V6, Cargo Package (especially the built in trunk storage), MP3 player compatibility, arm rest console is big, well thought-out, and can be used in many different ways, MPG meter in center display is fun and helpful in conserving gas  ","Gas mileage could be better yet, better quality materials for some of the door handles and door paneling, the trunk storage in the cargo pack would benefit hugely from a drainage hole so it could be used as a small cooler, smoother transitions between gears -- can feel it in the pedal just slightly"

Some nice improvements over the 08's with the extra HP, new transmission, and other minor tweaks. Getting about 23mpg mixed driving (30city/70highway mix). Nice looking inside and out for what it is. Still a lot of cheapness though with some of the plastics used. Even with the 240hp v6, still not impressed with everyday driving power. Still feels like an overburdened 4cyl unless you really get on it. Transmission has trouble finding the right gear a lot of times, particularly at lower speeds. Has the potential to be very quiet but excessive wind noise comes noticeably from side windows and rear hatch. This isnt a lexus after all though.","Ground clearance, Sync, good MPG for what it is. Styling inside and out.","You can tell the cabin is well insulated from noise, but the excessive wind noise from front windows and hatch ruin it. Such pin pointed sources of noise is annoying.

I drove quite a few of them and gave Ford another look. The Escape drives a lot smother, the Crv was bumpy, had less leg room, noisey 4 cylinder, and the styling was sort of ugly. My Escape is loaded, the stereo is 320 wts. Leather is very comfortable, steering great, ride quiet, got the 17"" wheels, so handling is sports car like, shifts very smooth, so far I love the Escape. I hope it's as reliable as the Honda. Every time I pass a Crv I say to myself, glad I didn't buy one. Get the locking lugs for the expensive mags and cargo mat. I got the 4 cyl. for mileage.","Moon roof, elec. steering, leather, audiofile stereo, looks, ride, handling, 17"" wheels, comfort, quiet ride, and back up alarm.
