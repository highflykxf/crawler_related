5,Alot of car for a subcompact,Laurie Harrington ,12/10/2016,5,5,4,,,5,5,4,5,,,The O2 sensor was bad when I bought it but after that was repaired it's been a great little car. I changed the timing belt at 88k. Use copper spark plugs. She hates platinum. Freeway travel at speeds above sixty are noisy.,,
5,chevy aveo,rodericka ,09/02/2016,5,5,,,,,,5,5,,,"I love my new car , its a great Starr for me to start building my credit. Plus the workers will work with you as much as possible to get you driving the same day. The financing is great & reasonable I'm glad to pay a car note on something I can afford thanks to the good workers.",,
4,Happy with the purchase of my first new car,T. Jacklin ,10/21/2015,4,3,3,,,4,4,4,4,,,"I bought this car new off the lot.  Within a few months I noticed a screeching noise out on the open highway in a cross wind.  Come to find out it was something to do with the design of the vehicle (not safety) and after a quick fix at the shop, the noise was gone.  I wanted a bare bones car.  Lets features, less to go wrong, less expense.  This car is perfect for me.  It can be parked anywhere, not overly spunky but can whip it on the highway.  The fuel mileage is great, only a few minor repairs (mostly from lack of use, not over use) like creaky doors, a rear hatch release that sticks, heater only works on blast (at least it works).If you are looking for something to get you from point A to B without a lot of bells and whistles, this is your ride.  It now has 78,000kms on her, just had the control arm replaced today, new water pump a couple weeks ago.  These are things that are going to need replacing regardless, and I think after 6 years that is fair. Still has original brakes, clutch, wipers, numerous other things.  I am more than happy with 'The Intimidator'.   I would buy another one in a minute.  It's GREAT in the snow! (Granted you know how to drive in it.  I am Canadian.  I have this skill)",,
3,Maybe I should have spent a little more,Rob ,09/30/2015,,,2,,,,,3,3,,,"I bought my aveo new in 2009, taking advantage of cash for clunkers got it for about 8k new so I really can't complain about the price. Over the years ita has treated me alright. During the warranty period I did have to have a gear in the manual transmission replaced which would have been pretty costly if I had to pay for it. Had a spark plug boot recall also which was apparently causing some vehicles to run poorly...never noticed that but got it fixed nonetheless. This car does go through a set of tires in about 30k miles, even less for the cheap ones that came on it new....think I replaced those at about 20k. I have done all maintenance routinely, haven't really had any engine trouble. Did have a phantom check engine light at one point and dealer charged me 100$ to tell me that oxygen sensor was stuck in the open position, quoted me about 500$ to fix but after I reset the light the issue never returned. Had to replace a rear axle bushing to the tune of $300 at about 60k. Front disc breaks have held up well still haven't even had to change the pads at 65kk, mechanic says they have plenty of life left. Although the rear drums are currently getting replaced along with shoes for $400 because the shoe came off one locking up my wheel and not allowing me to go home from work last night. This car is 6 years old and has 65k miles. For the most part it has been reliable and I plan on getting another couple years out of it, but I do feel like I have had to fix more than should have been necessary on such a new car that has been well taken care of.  Next time I will go with something a little higher end. Forgot to mention I average about 30 mpg or a little over so can't complain about that!",,
1,I paid for this!!,Rick ,08/18/2015,1,1,1,,,1,5,1,1,,,"This car sucks giant piles of rehashed rubber tires.   Worthless.  Malfunctions all the time.  The latest is the awesome engineering where they put the transmission cooler inside the radiator... YES, inside it.  6 years old, 38k miles and the cooler erodes inside the radiator sending trans fluid into radiator and radiator juice into the tranny.  Brilliant!!!  Jack wagons.  This car was built to fall to pieces so that the consumer is forced to buy a new vehicle.  This car is criminal and GM should repay everyone of us who bought the scrap heap.  I will NEVER buy a Chevy again.  E V E R ! ! ! ! ! !   Tempted to leave that pos at the dealership!",,
2,Gives Cheap a whole new meaning.,David Albee ,07/25/2015,2,3,3,,,2,3,3,3,,,"I have had my Aveo for going on 5 years now.  I should have walked past it the moment that I ran my fingers over the grill and the black paint powder that came off on my finger was present.Now the entire reason for my purchase was that I needed a vehicle that I could drive into the dirt.  I commute to work everyday and any vehicle was going to be getting aged prematurely.  However, this does not excuse the wiper blades disintegrating in the second month of ownership.  I understand that Korea may not have the winters that we Canadians do but wow!  Anyhow, new blades on moving forward.  Wait, what is that awe-full racket?  It can't be the engine already...  For crying out loud it sounds like the engine is trying to leap out from under the hood....   Notice in the mail, ""Dear Aveo owner please proceed to your nearest Chev dealer to get your wiring replaced as the engineers have discovered an issue with the gaps of your spark plug and wiring harness.""As my car is lurching and crying ""No kidding there is an issue."" .  Okay so contact my dealer that I purchased my car from, ""Sorry, we can't help you with that.""  ""We don't have the parts to fix it right now."".  Click...   Wait, what?  Yo Rick, I need you to put new plugs in and wiring.  ""Isn't that a recall?  Shouldn't your dealer do that?"", to which I replied.  ""Yes"", ""Yes they should."" ""So can you do this?""Driving my now behaving Aveo out of Rick's shop and noting the it will be a cold day in hell before I go back to the dealer.   Not long later.""Hmmm, are my headlights dirty?""  After looking I realized they were not dirty just one of the bulbs had burned out.  No big deal, I have now replaced 3 bulbs.The creme de la creme had to be driving to work one morning and there was a little bit of snow on the road.  I am Canadian and have been driving this road since 1989.  No problem........So why am I now staring at a terrified lady facing me and we are traveling in the same direction.  I mean her eyes were like dinner plates.  After I hit the drifted snow on the side of the road I have come to realize yet another issue with the Aveo.The rear brake has a tendency to lock.  Terrifying right...   I mean the freaking pad came off the shoe inside the drum......  Think about that for a second..They are supposed to be molecular bonded to the shoe to prevent that sort of thing from happening.  ""Yo, Rick!!"" ""I need you to take a look at this rear brake, something is definitely [non-permissible content removed]!""""Umm, Dave the drum is really stuck on there."" - ""I know, I scared the H*** out of some lady in a SUV that was behind me, I was looking at her while i was going backward.""A couple hours later... ""Dave, I have never even heard of this happening.""  ""Once i manage to get the drum off the pad was off the shoe..""Do not under any circumstance buy this vehicle, it redefines cheap and I would swear substandard parts.  I honestly can not express how confused I am about how this actually made it to market.Oh and now the screws to the air filter have corroded and I will have to likely cut them and tap them to change the air filter.",,
2.625,Least reliable I've ever owned,bandit96 ,04/08/2015,,,4,4,1,1,,3,4,1,3,"I bought this car new in 2009, knowing full well that I was making a trade off on some of the bells and whistles offered in other models. That's not an issue; if it wasn't for it being an unreliable and expensive piece of junk to run I would still be driving it.

I have a mechanical background, and know about driving and maintaining a car to make it last. Unfortunately, in the six years of ownership and only 70k kilometers (43k miles) this heap was in and out of the shop at least a dozen times. The last year of ownership, when it was out of warranty cost me more in repairs then my last GM vehicle did in 10 years and over 350k kms (210k miles).

In short, never again a GM for me.","It was the simple machine I wanted. I liked the look, and the feel of it.",Let GM go bankrupt for real this time. If this is the dreck they bring to market and sell to people they deserve to fail. Chevy was once the best car a working man could buy. Those days are now a distant memory.
3.25,Not too bad for the price,misslil ,06/12/2014,,,3,3,3,4,,3,3,3,4,"Purchased new in 2009 and have put mostly highway miles on it - up to 93,300 now. Get about 33 mpg. Did really great the first 4 years except for having alignment problems. Finally got that worked out. Had problems with AC last summer..fans not blowing much air out of vents. Had to have the rear O2 sensor replaced last month and then the air intake hose this month. Biggest problem is the parts had to come from the dealer and they are outrageously expensive! Approx. $240 for each part. Just read review on another website that the air intake hose was made in 2 parts, but you must buy the whole assembly. Not cool GM. My next car probably won't be a Chevy.",Good mpg. My car has good acceleration for a small car (have read other reviews where that's a problem).,Seats are not that comfortable.

It was thousands cheaper than the stripped toyota and we have cruise, tilt power everything and on star. Overall its ok 3 out of 5.

After a year finally got a dealer tech. to admit is was a poor design from chevy & they stopped making such. However, chevy never told us about this problem or did a recall.Also the dealers now tell us that they only can change the oil as the whole clutch assembly must be dropped and the filter itself cost extra. Also there is always residual oil drops from the change and the burning smell in the engine. Our idea was to have an inexpensive & easily maintained car, which it is not, it is just cheap!

Last night, I was in a horrendous car accident. The entire front of my car was taken off even at 7 mph (an Acura MDX slammed into me- not my fault). I was not hurt and neither was my passenger. My airbags did not deploy and Onstar never called. I called to complain to Chevy and all they could do was say I wasn't hit in the right spot for the air bags to deploy. The pick up is garbage and I am often beeped at for not being able to accelerate. I also get about 16-18 mpg city. I use a gallon of gas each day going 20 miles. I will NEVER buy another Chevy. ",I can fit into small parking spaces.,"This car needs a serious amount of work, and from what I have seen with the Sonic, the Sonic is no better. It needs better pick up (the Sonic offers 138 horsepower- that's a joke for a 'turbocharged' car especially when the Aveo only has 107), air bags that actually work, and cup holders in a place where I can actually insert a cup."

Aveo is made of poor quality and backed by dealerships and GM who will not admit there are HUGE problems with this car (see the Forum on the Aveo for the tons of issues).

2,Already want to trade in after only 3 months.,bkm89 ,04/03/2011,,,2,3,1,3,,1,3,2,1,"Three months ago I traded in my truck to find a car with better gas mileage. We found an aveo. My parents really liked it, and the dealer(my fathers cousin) also told us it was a very good car.Not the case. I have no good things to say. The gas mileage is nowhere near the expected I get no better than 25, and all my driving is highway or back roads. Not good in the snow even with studded directionals. The heater makes a ticking noise, very loud especially on highway.

Even the tires were an oddball size. To get the gas mileage that was stated. My fiances car is said to get in the upper 30s per gallon and he easily gets 40 to 42. Our cars are the same year. Guess I should have bought a toyota since an Aveo isn't even American made after all."

I'm averaging 31 mpg on the highway and that's not enough.  It's loud, not really well-built and to be honest, it's easy to imagine heavy damage meeting anything larger than a mailbox, should you get in an accident.  The oil filters are spendy.

4.5,So far So good,Jonathon Peterson ,02/25/2010,,,5,4,4,5,,5,4,5,4,"We hesitated to purchase a new vehicle since 1981 due to the huge drop in value.  The Aveo is a replacement for an ageing Subaru Justy being towed by our motor home.  First we were very surprised that the Aveo was not designed to be towed with drive wheels on the ground.  A tow dolly fixed the problem. The economy is right on the numbers with our 5 speed manual and keeping the speed under 60 mph.  At 75-80 we still average near 30 mpg.  Learn to drive the RPMs not the economy marks on the dash and you get reasonable power.  Handling is better than our old Metro, not as quick as the old Subaru, not near as fun (but a much better car) than our 1972 Honda 600.  So far, good value for the money ","Interior room and most of all the Price.  All in all, great value for the money.  I like a 5 speed transmission.
