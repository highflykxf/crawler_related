The only maintenance performed have been oil changes and front brake pads once. Drives great on highways and passes other cars easily.

4.75,Mitsubishi is a good option,sumncguy ,05/01/2013,,,3,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We bought our Gallant new in 2008 and have over 130k trouble free miles on it. NO. Let me say this again NO Major problems with this car. We simply do the planned maintenance. One downside is with the wrong tires, the car is loud. Alot of interior noise. Something just started rattling around in the trunk area .. sounds like something body related. I had a mitsubishi engine in my 1999 Grand Voyager and we ran that to almost 300k. 2 FOR 2, Mitsubishi has been good to me. A great alternative to the overpriced Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans.

4,Overall a decent car - Needs many small improvements,diesengine ,01/02/2012,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Overall quite pleased. Car yields about 25 mpg in 90% city, 10% highway driving. Like the sound of the engine when accelerating. Not that many on the road so it stands out with its sporty styling. Random noises occasionally come from the cabin. Can hear sound of gas sloshing around in back when filled full. Rear was redesigned in 2009 which looks somewhat like Lexus IS although with larger tail lights. Also added for 2009 was 4-wheel ABS, Tire pressure monitor, shiftable transmission and daytime running lights. The car sits lower to the ground than other midsize sedans and is more fun to drive than just about all except for the Mazda6. Has tight steering which lets you feel the road. ","MIVEC Engine, Sturdy feel, low to the ground, good crash test ratings, Strong Heat / AC, Orange-Red Instrument panel at night, Roomy, Steel wheels.","Shave few hundred pounds off the curb weight for better pickup and mpg, Needs projector headlights, MPG computer, miles until empty, temperature display, timing chain instead of timing belt, dual exhaust, double wishbone suspension, 4-speed transmission??, upgrade to at least 5-speed, needs slightly more torque down low."
3.125,Could have been better,nick_ole ,03/27/2011,,,3,3,2,3,,4,3,4,3,"I bought the base version of this car... It's very plastic, especially the trunk that sounds like a tin-can when you close it. Vehicle has lots of blind spots but for the money, it's still okay to drive. One morning, transmission started shifting heavy, took it to the dealer and after 2 days I find out that a squirrel had chewed off a wire that was supplying power to the onboard computer.. My question is, whey leave such an important cable exposed to the element through the vehicle design in the 1st place.Most annoying issue was the squeal of the car when I reverse right after starting the vehicle. Dealer says is happens to all Gallants.Just traded in...",Acceleration.... Very well for a 2.4 - V4 engine,
4.375,Superb Value,Mngoodtimes ,12/02/2010,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,4,4,"Excellent acceleration for a 4- banger.  Wish the MPG were a bit better, have been averaging 22 miles with combo driving.  It's been freezing here in MN so I'm hoping the MPG will tick up a bit in the spring/summer.   Drivers seat is very comfortable and has great leg room (I'm 6'1, 220 lbs).  Rear leg room space is great but the seats are a bit low.  My 10 yr old has starting using her booster seat again in order to see out the window better.  Purchased new, the 2009 Galant ES was $22K.  I purchased mine a couple weeks ago with 49k miles for $9991...not too shabby!!!",Exterior styling is sharp....really like the back end.  Great space and value for a 4-door family sedan.  Don't see many of them on the road...it's nice to be different.  AC and heat are A+.,Improve MPG.  My 1999 Camry avg'd 25 MPG in combo driving.  You'd think a car that is 10 yrs newer would be able to improve upon this.  All black dashboard is a dust magnet.  Rear seating could use some improvement.
4.5,Superb Value,Placenshow ,11/26/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Just purchased a used 2009 Galant ES with 49,xxx miles for $9991, brand new, this car was $22k! Traded in a 1999 Camry LE, which we loved, but were looking for a new model family sedan. So far so good. Plenty of space, decent acceleration for a 4 cylinder, and driver seat is quite comfortable. Doesn't have all the bells & whistles of Camry/Accord but pricing is a definite plus and reliability is above avg from what I've read on numerous sites. Looking forward to many happy years of worry free driving. ","Driver's seat, exterior looks, value.",Nothing comes to mind yet.  Ask me again in 3-4 years.
5,I like my Galant,Julie ,11/13/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I really like my 2009 Mitsubishi Galant. I have been driving it for a little over a month, and have no complaints. It had 29,000 miles on it when I bought, and now has 31,000 miles on it. I was driving a 1986 Lincoln town car, so it is a new experience. Other than feeling every little bump on the road, compared to the smooth ride of the Lincoln, it is a dream. The pick-up (acceleration) getting on the freeway is great, even before it's completely warmed up. The rear window defogger works pretty fast. The defrost works good, and the air-conditioning will freeze you out of there. The stereo system is good, with a nice cd player and radio, and the handling is good. I wouldn't trade it. ","My favorite features are the overall handling, and anti-lock brakes.  The stereo has great sound.  I also like the feature for low tires, with the sign that comes on when you need to add air.","The only improvements I could suggest would be a better shock system for a smoother ride.  However, this would probably increase the price, and it had a good price."
4.875,Best car you might not know about,happykamper ,08/10/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was reading all of these reviews and I wanted to agree with what everyone was saying. I have had this car for almost 2 years now. I bought it used with 17,000 miles. The reason why I purchased this vehicle was its low sticker price. I must admit I liked it from the beginning the 4 clyinder has power. The reliability is great all I have done is its recommended oil changes and that's it. Very roomy, let me tell you that's really important to me since I'm 6' 250 pounds! I live in Vegas and with all the driving through the snow on the mountains or the 100 plus degree temps. This vehicle has performed just great! I'm about to do my 60,000 mile service!

5,SECRETS OUT - SMART MAN'S ACCORD!,blb ,06/27/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've looked for over 4 months for a used mid-size car, I looked at 2008 Accord, I wasn't pleased with the road noise and the asking/selling price tag of $17,000+. My research began again, back to square one back to crash test ratings sites/edmunds.com and that's when I found the Galant. I liked how it drove more than the Accord and the price was over $8,000 less! Most used Galants for sale had been rental cars and with over 35,000 miles on them, but I kept looking and found some with less than 18,000 miles and for below $12,000! So I was sold! I couldnt be happier - I did my research and I have saved over $8,000.00! I may do an update review if Im still pleased with my poor/smart's Accord!:)",,"Auto locks once car begins to drive, lock on glove compartment, lighted vanity mirror."
5,Impulse buy - turned out GREAT!,Brandon in Jersey ,05/20/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I saw this car in the show room (black w/ black leather, 18's. )  gorgeous. Made my heart stop.  Sitting in it, I thought, ""I can't afford this"" . Killer sale, got it for like 22k and had them drive it out of the showroom.  So far, so good, been almost 13 months.  No problems, almost 14k miles.  I'm loving it.  Definitely a head-Turner.  Have not see others like mine on the road thus far!  Unsung hero. I think Mitsubishi has a lifer now.  Definitely would recommend!  ","The wheels!  Heated seats, sunroof.","I didn't find my steering wheel radio controls for 2 months!  Would like power passenger seat, too. Radio is not loud enough (Came from 99 Max w/Bose)."
4.5,Better than the reviews I've read,Jamie in Las Vegas ,02/08/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,5,5,"I've had a 98 Jeep Wrangler for a decade. So moving to a sedan is an upgrade in most ways. Interior, styling, ride, acceleration; ALL are an improvement for me.  I know a Camry or Accord might be better outfitted, but so far, I'm digging it. It is at once distinctive AND doesn't call attention to itself. 2009 restyle fixes design incongruities from earlier models. 4 cyl engine does much better than I thought it would. I'm very pleased.  If you are moving from a lesser car you won't have many complaints. I test drove a 2010 Kia Optima before this one, and the 2009 Galant kicks its behind. But then, I guess it should. Love it right now. We'll see if I feel the same after 9 years.",Controls are laid out well. Wheels are nice. I really like the improved lines of the 2009 front end and grille. Tail lights look really cool. Comfy seats. Very smooth ride. I don't see many on the road and kinda like that not everyone else has one. Mine has no badging except Mitsu logos. Love that.,"Front passenger footroom will cramp long legged, big footed riders. Fabrics are kinda blah. MP3 input would be nice, bluetooth too. Button controls in door aren't intuitive. Folding back seat would've been nice too."
4.75,A Good Value,Bruce ,02/01/2010,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"This is my first Mitsu (prior Camry & Accord owner).  Not as refined as a Camry/Accord, but with rebate and deal, a far better value for the money.   However, I'll be bringing it back for third service to hunt down an intermittent engine noise.  Although disappointing on that one issue, it has been otherwise a good car (so far).  A comfortable fit for a tall person.  I purchase a car and drive it into it's grave. Camry's and Accords have gone the distance for me (10-15 reliable years).  I'm hoping the Gallant will go the same distance.   ",Nice exterior styling that stands out in the current Camry/Accord crowd.  Good leg-room.  Longer warranty period than the competition.      ,Needs rear fold-down seats.        
4.875,The most UNDERRATED car on the market,mike ,11/18/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"For the price, this car will take on Toyota, Nissan, Honda and all. Best price period? YES. Ride, comfort, room.This is my first Mitsubishi and it won't be my last. They have a customer for life. The power of this 4 cyl will fly. Mileage is 26 in town.

4.5,Best Bang for the Buck,Mitsu Believer ,10/30/2009,,,4,4,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I am a car guy.  I bought the Ralliart used surprisingly.  It looks great, drives and is simply a rocket ship.  The Liquid Silver is a great paint and the wheels are nice.  Leather is comfortable.  The Navi is okay with accuracy but the features of the Navi and radio are terrific.  My wife even enjoys the ride of the car.  Winter is almost here and I'm curious to see how it handles snow.  I am averaging between 420-450 miles a fill up.",Engine is very strong.  FWD feel is solid as well.  Seats are very comfortable and instrumentation is great.  Satellite radio is good.  Looks are sporty.  Love the headlights.,"Premium unleaded needed with the high compression engine.  Gas fill ups get expensive.  Gas gauge when empty seems inconsistent. Sometimes it has almost 2 gallons left, which is okay so you don't run out but annoying to me.  Some interior plastics are a bit too much in spots."
4.375,Great Car at Great Price,KzooFan ,10/01/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,4,4,"This is the second Galant I have owned (previously had 2003 with 95,000 miles and that was a great car). Have had this 2009 ES for one month and have put 2,000 miles on it so far. Not a problem, not a strange noise, nothing. Very nice car. Great styling. Nice to have something a little different than everyone else has. Nice ride, love that ABS is standard. Comfortable seats. Very roomy. Very pleased so far.","Comfortable, love the satin mesai color (kind of changes from gray to blue to green depending on the light). Love the safety features and warranty, just in case.","Don't care for the dash (will probably be a dust collector). Wish it had a second power outlet, but not a big deal. Feel like it should have a fifth- gear, but not a big deal there either. Nice car, good price."
4.25,"Overall, Love It!",GrandTurk ,09/22/2009,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"I bought this car new one month ago and enjoy the ride to work everyday (city driving).  My 6'3"" tall but lean body build fits into the drivers seat with just enough headroom.  The ride is a tad noisy from the engine, particularly with the high rpm's upon acceleration, but not so much to be bothersome.  I don't care about the ""plastic"" interior comments from some of the reviewers.  I care more about the small side-view mirrors and wonder why nobody has mentioned this.  Also, the turning radius leaves a lot to be desired.  Why can't I turn into tight parking spots? The trunk is roomy.  The rear passenger space is roomy for a small car.  The good crash test performance gives you confidence.","Attractive, sporty look.  Zips around town and pulls out onto the highway nicely (for a 4-cyl).  Adequate gas mileage.  Nice sound system.  Good handling on winding roads.  Confident, low-to-the-ground  feel of the road. Fog lights.  Roomy enough for occasional 5-passengers.","Turning radius is terrible.  Steering maxes out when you need to cut the wheels tighter.  You have to do multi-point parking maneuvers. Side-view mirrors are too small, making visibility with mirrors poor.  Door handles have cheap feel to them."
5,Good contender,yubilo ,09/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my first Mitsu. Ive been driving it for about 2 months now in summer weather on both city and highway. Im combining about 25 MPG on 91 octane gas, which I think is great due to the elements. The car feels sturdy and 2.4 MIVEC engine picks up well on sportronic mode. It has a roomy interior and comfortable front and back seats. The controls are well laid out for easy access on the go. It comes with high performance all season tires which comes handy on the east coast changing seasons. This car is great buy! Everything sums up to a comfortable, reliable, spacious, sporty fun vehicle to drive. I would recommended this vehicle to a small to mid size family looking for a 4 door sedan. ","Ive got the leather, sun and sound package on the base model. The 8 speaker sound is exceptional responsive. The heated seats, side mirrors and dimming rear view mirror are some of the features that I enjoy the most. Its SOCH MIVEC engine proves awesome low end torque and HP for a great drive!","Somewhat better feel for the interior materials, auxiliary port, and  a manual transmission option will do for me! "
3.125,It's just OK,Chuck ,09/14/2009,,,3,4,4,4,,3,2,2,3,"Mitsubishi did a good job on the rear end of the 09, but hardly did anything to the front. The Sports Edition that I have does have the chrome top to the grill and darkened headlights but that's it. Its ok on gas and ok on comfort. On a recent trip, my backside really got sore so I assume the seats could have been made better. I do not like the waffle like dash, I can already see where dust settles on it. When in idle, you can't turn the headlights off, like when you're waiting for someone. To me that's irritating. There is not an accessory adapter in the console like the prior years did. Engine is very noisy compared to my 08 Camry, and the doors sound tinny compared to the Camry.",Rear of the car. ,"Availability to turn off the headlights at idle time.

4.875,Value plus,princmd ,07/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I just picked mine up today. After you factor price, 10 yr 100000 mile warranty, then Toyota, Nissan and Honda just don't  make sense. So far, I've enjoyed driving it around. It's comfy and the 4 cylinder feels as good as any on the market. If you are in the market for a comfortable, modestly priced, long term family vehicle, not another run of the mil ""Camry"" like the neighbors, then buy this car.","I like the center dash, exterior design and wood grain accents. The stereo is pretty good and the seats are comfortable. I like the cloth seats in this car more so than Camry, Accord and Altima. The pearl white paint is classy. ","I-pod port should be standard. Interior materials are okay and you would not know any better until you sit in the Lancer. The wiper blades also should be better integrated to ""hide"" from view."

4.25,I Love my Ralliart!,Brett Gordon ,03/30/2009,,,3,4,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"The Galant Ralliart '09 is a very powerful and beautiful car; I love it. High points are acceleration, cruising power, sport leather seats, aluminum pedals, 20"" alum. alloy wheels, stereo system, GPS system with many additional (and helpful) applications. Low points include cheap plastic interior, VERY tight suspension system giving a bumpy (and noisy) ride, adjustable seat limitation set too high, rattling seat belt mechanism, over-sized tail lights, and the GPS DVD player in the trunk is set in a very poor location. However, the Pros far outweigh the Cons. As an all-around sport edition of a mid-size car, I'm very pleased with it, but hopefully, the 2010 will address the low points.","Incredible acceleration; it takes off like a rocket in both automatic and manual shift combo. Leather seats, steering wheel, and shift. GPS system with extra features. Fuel economy. 3.8L MIVEC engine provide low RPM cruising power, gorgeous stereo system with Serius Satellite, and truck space. ",Total redesign of the interior - get rid of the plastic! Improve sound proofing to neutralize excessive road noise. Improve suspension system to give it a smoother ride. Lower the driver seat limitation for tall people. Give the Ralliart a more sporty exterior design - it's still too tame for the $.
4.625,Pleasantly Surprised,zjdewitz ,03/27/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"Before I test drive my Galant, I had preconceived notions about the Mitsubishi brand. I'd always heard that they were unreliable, underpowered, and boring. But, once I put my foot on the gas, all of that flew out the window. The 2.4L has plenty of power, and has more pickup than my previous car, a 1999 Saab 9-3 turbo, even though it has less horsepower.  The Galant rides perfectly on the highway, with some wind noise that some of my other cars didn't have. But, it handles better than I could have expected. Braking, accelerating, and cruising are all top notch.","Lots of head room and leg room, good sized trunk, good fuel economy, and mp3 CD player with good sounding speakers.","I would have liked to have seen more standard options, like fog lights, seat warmers, and a sunroof. Also, the radio doesn't get the best FM radio reception."
4.875,First new car,Amanda ,03/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After 3 used cars, the 09 Galant became my first new one and I love it! I came out of a 98 Galant and what a difference.  I've racked up over 12000 miles in 5 months so I have a good feel for all aspects of the car's performance.  I could nitpick and agree about the lower quality plastic interior and stuff, but that's not what I rely on to get me around town. The interior is driver friendly, spacious, and comfortable in any type climate.  It pulls well going up mountains, downshifts nicely in bad weather and has smooth acceleration.  I would wish for a few more horses on those short on ramps, but otherwise, it has plenty of get up and go.","I love the sunroof and heated seats!  I wasn't too keen on the sport wheels, but when my friends told me how sharp they looked I decided to keep them.  I also really like the overall body design.  It tickles me to see people's faces when I tell them it's not a Lexus.","Perhaps better quality interior components and more user friendly cupholders; other than that, none!"

I'm about 6'1"" and it fits me perfectly. I had a 02 Eclipse and 00 Linc Continental. This Galant is perfectly wedged between those cars in terms of performance, ride quality, features, gas mileage and size. The Galant gets me from A to B with good sound from the 140w system, decent pep when passing hwys, great safety features.","Look for 09. Ton of safety features.

There really was no contest, Mitsubishi wins again. I purchased the 2009 Galant Sports edition 4 cylinder model. I am a big guy and have plenty of room anywhere in the car. The trunk space is huge. There are plenty of comfort features, heated leather seats, tire pressure. This model drives like a 6 cylinder and feels very sporty and has a comfortable sedan feel at the same time. The Galant is very reliable. For the money I feel this is a winner all the way.","I love the sound system, heated leather seats, the room and comfort. I also love the drivability and the feel of the car. The car drives like a dream and is very reliable, with a great warranty to go with it.",There are a few quirks I would like to see changed or improved upon. There is no gas locking feature for the gas door. The mirrors can be a little bigger and maybe movable for parking. The plastic by the doors scratch easily. The gas mileage can be better. Overall I am very happy. It's a winner.
5,Best buy in class,Best Buy ,09/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I looked at the Camry because of styling, but after driving it I could feel the car felt more like a GM than a Toyota.  I then looked at the new Accord and was overall impressed with the car, except for the comfort of the vehicle and ease of access to the controls.  I even looked at Nissan which I said I'd never do again.  The plastic interior still needs major improvement.  Finally I figured I would look at the Mitsubishi Galant.  The sport edition pulled  me right in and for a 4 cylinder it has PLENTY pep.  The handling is great and the car is extremely comfortable.  Even the interior is top notch.  I love my Galant.  Toyota just lost another loyal customer and Mitsubishi gained a new one!","Mivec engine, handling, comfort and gas mileage.

The plastics are cheap and that cheapness is everywhere. The plastic scratches very very easily. My car has 4000 miles and looks like it has 50,000. It has only one 12 V adapter. Cup holders are way to far back, seat heater buttons are in a horrible location. The car runs and drives great with the 4cyl motor. This motor does take a bit to rev up but then the power kicks in. By no means is this car fast from the stop, if you want that get that Raliart model. I have already had the turn signal break and the rubber on the brake pedal fall off ( warranty items). The gas mileage is not that great in town.","Heated seats, Stereo system, reliability","To much cheap plastics, much needed upgrades to the materials. Leather seats don't even smell or feel like leather. Stereo controls have very small display and no artist name on Sirius stations. Dashboard/Door panel material is like sandpaper and attracts stuff like a lint roller. Larger mirrors."
4.625,Pleased as punch,orotunds ,06/30/2008,,,5,5,2,5,,5,5,5,5,"Having driven many different rental vehicles in the past two years, I had a good idea of what I wanted, and didn't want, in the vehicle I was buying. The 2009 Sports Galant from Mitsubishi motors is a great sedan with a moderate price. It reminds me of the Hyundai Azera but it costs several thousand dollars less. The 4 cylinder has good get up and go, and it accelerates quickly. The car handles well and the ride is very smooth. The car has a big trunk with the option of gaining more length by accessing the back seat interior. The car is the new canyon beige color and the exterior and interior is stylish. I am very satisfied with the car, and  would have paid even more for it if I had to","sun roof, instrument cluster panel, ",glass holder is  cheap plastic and doesn't match the rest of the design
5,Ralliart Fun,Wayne ,02/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We owned a Mitsubishi Diamante VRX 03 model and were looking to replace it after 5 years of trouble free driving, and found out the Diamante was discontinued. The other car makes were all test driven and some stood out more than others, like the Passat and Maxima sedans, and then my wife and I drove the 09 Gallant Ralliart. Well it rekindled our love for Mitsubishi with the build quality in the car plus the wonderful 258 horsepower 3.8 MIVEC engine and sport shift automatic transmission. All we can say is we recieved more for our money and fun for our dollar!","Engine, transmission, new body style, projector headlamps, interior comfort and room, 360 watt 6cd satellite stereo system, heated seats, nice wheels and goodyears with tire pressure monitors.",None @ this time.
5,Great job!,John ,02/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Although Mitsubishi only made slight changes to the 2009 Galant, they seemed to pick the best features to improve.  The ride is smoother and quieter.  The new sport fabric seat is very comfortable and they even have power and 2-part heated fabric seats.  They did away with the cheap plastic console and it look very tastefully elegant.  A+ overall!","The seats and the interior, plus the tail lights look similar to the current trend.",Need bluetooth and the 30 gig hard drive navi system that they offer on the Lancer.
