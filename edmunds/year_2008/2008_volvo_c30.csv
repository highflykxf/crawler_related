My previous car are all Japanese and I consider myself a conservative driver. Never had an accident with this car yet. I like this car as it is fun to drive, great handling, solid on the turns. The down side is reliability. Up to now I had temperature sensor replaced, 12V plug replaced, front passenger seat unable to re track properly and the front left axle/hub seems to be clicking on certain right turns. Just like a problematic cv joint problem. brought to the mechanic and he has no clue even the issue is duplicated.

It is practical (overall small size, with easy back seat conversion to increased cargo volume), well balance (power and mileage), and simple inside. I used it to transport tools and materials for home improvement, to take my dog to the park, to go skiing (roof ski rack), and to go on hikes from trail heads far into the Washington state Cascade mountain roads. This car does all of this at good mileage, reliable services, and sporty feel. At 85K, so far I have had door auto lock relays replaced on warranty (it was locking door without command to do so). Windshield was replaced at 60K.","Front brakes were replaced at 35K. I have to remove and reinsert key for car to start (getting key error). Otherwise, no other issues that would make me even come close to regret I bought this wonderful speedster.

The turbo and handling are TT class and I know enough now to want all the airbags and doors so solid it takes help to open them.   So why aren't they selling?  Too much for the money.

I also considered, Audi A3 and the Volkswagen Golf. This car had better feeling materials inside then the VW. It handles very well.

It could use some extra torque though, and you should do everything in your power to stay away from potholes (I cringe at the slam of my 18 inch wheels over concrete expansion joints), but luckily with its superb handling, you can avoid them without difficulty. The sound system is unreal, the car is just one huge menu system. Everything can be changed, adjusted, and tweaked to your exact specifications. I wish the front didn't look exactly the same as the S40 and V50, but it's a small price to pay for having the coolest car around.","The stereo is spectacular, the myriad controls over everything are like I've never seen in any car.","More standard equipment would be nice, and although this is a tall order, All-Wheel Drive would be great. Also, with more torque would come better fuel economy, which should be a reality in a car of its size. Unfortunately, Volvo has never been king of the mpg hill, but we forgive them "
4.875,Hands down fantastic auto,Yoquiero Unapatada ,06/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The C30 handles beautifully. Fast. Super zippy! I live in Los Angeles, where quick acceleration is part of the traffic landscape. The design of the C30 is purely amazing! Also, many people are under the impression that this vehicle costs more than 40k. These things matter to a 40 yr old  like me..","The R Design interior is stunning. Leather, dash. Stereo is great. Really cool storage area behind the dash.","The lights are continuously on. There's no sensor for automatic shut off. If you attempt to turn the lightswitch, you arrive at another setting that remains on when you park the vehicle. You can't win. Also, the stereo's great, but there's no Bluetooth pairing... What happened Volvo?"
5,"Wow, definitely worh every penny!",efrazier ,06/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased this car after looking at a SRT4 Caliber and a Mazda Speed 3. I was just about set on the Mazda when I found this car by accident, as soon as I saw it and started researching it was a done deal without the test drive. Then I drove it...wow!  This car is probably one of the most well balanced cars I have ever owned..even better than a BMW! I have no faults with this car whatsoever from an engineering perspective. The power, handling, comfort and design of the car are all superb!  Once I drove it I was done..no need to drive anything else because nothing else compares. I actually can't wait to take it on a long trip.","Inline 5 cyl turbo engine, memory foam seats, legroom in back seats, unigue styling, upgraded stereo and smooth/quite ride.  Chances are you will not see another C30 like yours, or see another one period.  The cool factor of this car is off the charts, this is one cool Volvo!","Some of the a la carte options really should be standard, like a trip computer (MPG, DTE, etc). Seats that have memory on ptting back to original position. 6 CD indash changer would be nice."
4.875,Reliable and Fun,Stephanie ,06/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased this car the minute it came out in October. I have put 17,000 miles on the car and have driven it across country 3 times. I was disappointed that cruise control was not standard  but I added it for 250 dollars after my first cross country trip. It has been extremely reliable and handles beautifully.  It handles mountain roads smoothly and never loses acceleration no matter what the grade is. It is extremely comfortable and spacious and I have sat in it for 12 hours at a time. It also has amazing cargo capacity once seats are folded down.  My only problem is that ulphostery beneath the glove compartment did come undone but it was easily repaired. ","Console, stereo system, heated seats",Cruise control should be a standard feature.  
5,Tons of Fun,BB ,05/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Lots of zip! Handles great! Grabs the road! Comfortable! Good mileage! Gets lots of compliments! Great price! Overall - great buy!,,
4.75,Unique and fabulous,rwisem ,04/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Fell in love with the design and the test drive clinched the deal.  Ordered custom built.  Terrific to drive, comfortable and quiet, but is a tiger when you step on it.

For just 1 day of rain, storm and a lil snow huu surprise!, when I open the the door water was all over my seats, take note both driver side and passenger side, so instead of enjoying the car, the mechanics are enjoying it at the dealer trying to find out where the leak is coming from so basically perfect for a car under 30g.

4.625,My Baby,drsherry ,03/30/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,3,5,"""Baby"" drives like a luxury car, which took a little getting used to (heated leather seats, smooth steering, quiet engine, etc). She can take off like a space rocket, especially going uphill, pushing me back into the seat. It makes me laugh right out loud--as does the incredible sound system! The BLIS system is very useful, as are the front and rear fog lights. The backseat is suprisingly roomy. Overally, I'm very happy.",I have the upgraded sound system with the ipod connection. The sound quality is so good that sometimes I look around thinking someone in the car with me. This is especially so regarding guitars and drums. That was absolutely worth the price.,No more Michellin tires! The frame on the driver's side windshield blocks a bit of my view (similar to a PT Cruiser). The doors are so big that it's hard to open the door without either hitting someone parked next to me or trying to slide in the car sideways.
5,Awesome Car,S.M. ,03/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Got the car last week. I love it, it is so much fun to drive. I also love that you don't see many on the street so you find people looking at your car wondering what it is. It has the perfect balance of a sports car and yet keeps the sophisticated feel of a Volvo. Much better buy than other cars in its class such as the volvo GTI, Civic SI, Mazda Speed 3, or Mini Cooper S. Test drove the rest and thought this one was the best choice.",2.5 liter turbocharged engine.  The console is also pretty sweet.,Not much leg room in the back seats. Maybe cut down on some trunk space and add some more room for back seats.  But I'm not sitting in the back so I don't care too much.
4.5,A Driver's Fun Vehicle,greenweenie ,03/12/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,3,5,"This vehicle was acquired in Jan 08. The worst winter in recent times for Michigan soon made it painfully obvious that the high performance Pirelli Rosso tires are not proper for locales that receive any measureable amount of snow. These tires immediately become road slicks and the vehicle will go nowhere. On dry or wet pavement, they are outstanding. Potholes are deadly for any tire, but for these Pirellis, it is certain immediate bankruptcy! ","Ride and handling tuning, while far from a Lotus Elise, is a good compromise for average driving conditions. One can have fun on mundane commutes.",
4.875,Fun and Safety,chefdude ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Oh what fun it is to ride... knowing you're surrounded by all those safety features! Had the C30 for a month and love it. The seats are unbelievably comfy and the front legroom is spacious (if no one is in the back seat). If you have a dog check to see if he can get climb up the hatch because is quite high off the ground. Power and handling are super. Engine and transmission feel responsive yet flexible; can shift from 2nd straight to 6th gear on freeway, no problem. Clutch is easy to push, won't fatigue leg. Stock stereo is powerful and has aux input for any mp3 player. Cabin storage a little tight but helps with clutter. Altogether a nice car, I'm very happy with my purchase.  ","Compact size, easy to park. Stereo system is fantastic (stock). Seats are great, manual even better than electric (too slow for rear access). Doors are HUGE for easy entry/exit (but heavy). Center ""floating"" console too cool for words and easy to use. Power is clearly there when you need it!","Optional cruise and back seat arm rest? The ""customization"" program is a joke."
4.875,Great car for the price,Scott ,03/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I bought this car mainly because no other car looks like it and it has the power when you need it. I test drove several other cars but this one just got me from the first drive. I am 38 years old with a wife and 2 kids. I did not want the boring family car or the SUV.  The wife has the SUV so we take her truck when we go out or travel. I travel about 70-100 miles per day so I need a car with good gas mileage.  I am getting over 25 miles on mixed driving which is good for a turbo car. Volvo wanted a car where the consumer can customize the car with the options you want.     ,"I love the power when you step on the gas.  There is nothing worse than a car who cannot get out of its own way. The radio, power sunroof, comfortable seats/ride are several great features.  ","I added the trip computer after for about $90 (worth it). I do wish the cruise control, 6 CD, hard load cover were standard but they are all options. The handling could be better, the car does not stick to the ground when you are going over bumps.  Volvo needs to work on the suspension/handling."
4.625,Wheeeee!  Fun and luxury.,lola ,02/22/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I haven't had this much fun with a car since I traded in my '72 Volvo 144 for a 1982 Rabbit.  Acceleration in 3rd gear pushes me back in the seat and I'm practically giggling when I have the excuse to lean on the gas to merge onto the highway.  Once there, it's incredibly quiet, 6th gear keeps the revs down, and handling is reliable and predictable.  I got the non-sports (1.0) model and the ride is very comfy. This car is great.  It's got the original tires which aren't great in snow, but they're not bad either.  Mileage depends on how you drive (duh).  I can push it some and still get the 20 mpg the EPA promises. I've only had it for 1000 miles; I'm infatuated.","Love the aux stereo/iPod connector in the armrest, and the floating dash. Overseas delivery was a great experience.","There should be a power connector in the armrest along with the audio, for those of us with washed-up batteries in our ancient iPods."
4.625,"A niche, but if you fit, this is the car",CarDude ,02/12/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I wanted something fun, but not one of the Racer Boy cars.  I have kids, but I'm more likely to be alone and take the wife's VW Passat with the family.  This car just FIT.  Excellent fuel economy, power when you want it, and space to take things.  Can even tow or mount stuff on the roof if needed.  Interior is very unique.  Some buttons take some getting used to, but overall a really nice stylish design.  I like the two rear seats as they didn't try to squeeze in 3.  Access with manual seats is great.  Comfort is good as long as you put the short people in back.  Volvo seats just seem to fit really nice for the long haul.  Even the carpet in the back doesn't seem to be a dog hair magnet.","Engine - torque from 1500 rpm.  Seats, great cloth and comfort.  Visibility - what blind spot?  Handling - tires grip great and suspension allows fun while still being comfy.  60"" of cargo with seats down - fit more than I thought. All kinds of tech available.  Regular maint is fairly easy for DIY.","While the list of options is impressive, many like cruise control, trip computer, and auto-dimming mirror should be standard equipment at this price point.  GPS looks like an afterthought.  Lose the $300 surcharge to add options. Screams for a DSG transmission.  Power seats slow for rear access."
4.75,Great Combo,Young 40 ,02/01/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I spent many hours on the internet and many weeks preparing to buy this car. Our family has a minivan and needs an Accord but this car won me over big time. There are many practical reasons to get a Honda, but the C30 adds so much to my driving experience while maintaining a sense of class that it became a perfect fit. I am 40, but not ready to drive a 40 year old no matter how much ""sense"" it makes. The C30 has a simple but well built and easy to use interior. The exterior styling is very unique. The T5 mated to the MT is the way to go. Almost got the AT at wife's request but the MT was too fun to drive and brought the car to life even more. Chose the 2.0 for styling and audio reasons.","dynaudio stereo rocks. stock stereo is great too. driver seat comfort. aggressive but sophisticated styling. safety technology. power. combo of sporty but comfortable drive. control of custom build feature.

4.875,First Small Hatchback,lgibsonjr ,01/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I read all the reviews and test drove several small hatchbacks before selecting the Volvo C30 (with only one option - automatic transmission). The C30 standard features met all my other requirements. Overall, it cost less than the Audi A3, has more comfort than the Volkswagon GTI, and enough power to compete with both. Personally I don't like to ""feel the road"" as much as some, and I enjoy the unique styling. The C30 is a nice blend of sportiness and comfort at a reasonable price. One added benefit is the fact you don't see many of them on the road (yet) so it stands out in the crowd.",Interior design - interesting and unique but still simple and clean. The all glass hatch provides incredible rear visibility. A long list of standard safety features.,A version with two more doors would be nice. Maybe some larger sideview mirrors. I've only have my C30 for a week so I'm still learning about it.
4.875,Wow,annabelle ,12/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I struggled between getting a Mini Cooper S and this car, and couldn't be happier with my choice. Add fun factor to smoother ride, a powerful motor, great sound system and easy to use. Suddenly, I love to drive!  And let's not forget ergonomic seats (great on long drives) and good trunk space, especially with seats down - fit a massage table, luggage for two, gifts and a large reclining beach chair no problem!","I can count on this car to do what I need it to do, which makes me feel safe and confident on the road.",Does it have cruise control?

I'm use to cars with much larger engines however this car motors effortlessly without much engine noise.  The controls are easy to manage and the upgraded sound system is great!  A must have!  The only one thing I dislike is that you feel every bump in the road.  Otherwise great car.,"Color, styling, sound system.",Bigger gas tank. 
5,I love it!,Pete ,11/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I considered buying Impreza WRX or Mazda Speed3, have driven both.

4.875,Volvo Smooth,Dave ,10/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is great.  It zips around like a sportster, while being extremely comfortable, smooth riding and safe.  It has average acceleration and fuel economy if you accelerate at 2,500 - 3,000 rpms.  But hammer down the gas pedal and at 5,000 - 5,500 rpms you are getting a thrust of acceleration.  Of course that thrust comes at a price of lower fuel economy.","Seats, styling and engine.",Standard cruise control and a cheaper non-turbo version for those who want a great car at a lower price.
