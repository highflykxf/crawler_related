Outside of oil changes, tires and brakes, it required absolutely no major repairs.  The vehicle was great for traveling with a family.  It has tons of cargo room and is comfortable.  It averaged between 19.5 - 21.0 miles to the gallon the entire life of the car.  One of the top features is the third row seating.  That came in handy in a multitude of situations.",,

I then duct-taped foam to three planks I got from walmart and wrapped in blanket material to match the vehicle interior. The planks fit over the ridge (where the cupholders are) so they are perfectly flat and sit without moving.

4.625,Great car??,Eric E ,04/29/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I have had people ask about the car. What is it? Who makes it? Ford!? Is it a wagon? is it a suv? is it a crossover? I say yes!!  This has the best of all three. Space for 6, good styling, strong V6. Rides really good. not spongy like a minivan and not rough like a full size suv. It's small enough to be a grocery getter yet big enough to fit a new dishwasher with out needing to remove the car seats. This wagon/crossover/suv has a lot to offer. You must check this one out. It has fit all my needs/wants. ","I like the memory seats( the wife is 5' and I am 6'2) so it saves a lot of time adjusting. The third seat that folds down and can be stowed flat if needed. Ride hight, the kids and mother-in-law can get in with out ""climbing in.""","Get rid of the daytime running lights. Get a second lever to control the wind shield wipers. I don't like needing take my hand off the wheel to get them on. The climate controls a to low. A little narrow in the trunk area, it a tight squeeze to get the clubs in. This is just nit picking."

Not a big fan, but the chrome helps. I own a 2000 Ford Taurus sedan. I was set on buying another one until I saw the Taurus-X. 2 problems so far. The first is the knocking sound that comes from the engine. I've been told that this is normal. The second is the manual latches on the seats. I've had nothing but problems w/the 2nd row driver side. It is very difficult to release and does not operate properly. They have not fixed or replaced the seat. I think they are waiting for my warrantly to run out. Other owners have had the same issues. I'm hoping enough people will complain to prompt a recall.",7 passenger seating,Need to consider changing seat latches. Cross Over Bars would be nice.

The Ford Taurus X is my favorite so far. The ride is smooth, the handling and braking exceed my expectations, and it is so comfortable.",My favorite feature is the ease of entrance and exit. My 92 year old father has difficulty getting into and out of other cars; they either sit too high or too low. The Ford Taurus X is just right. He loves the bar on the passenger side of the dashboard (What a great idea!!).,A passenger seat that rotated toward the door would make this a great choice of vehicle for aging baby boomers or people with disabilities.

A bit heavy on fuel, but it is a heavy vehicle. One pet peeve:  The keypad mastercode is NOT user changable!  It is permanent! Protect this code or one may face a security risk. Even if you program another code, the master code still works. Thieves may not be able to steal your car, but can steal what ever is inside. Ford needs to make the mastercode user changable and resetable in the event one forgets the programmed master code.  You can change the module to get another code, but it costs around $700 cdn.","There's only one name in tires and that is Pirelli.

Impressed with the leg room in all seats, and my kids love all of the compartments to put their stuff.  It has 12 cup holders!  The third row is easily accessible with a kid-friendly pop-up middle seat.  This was an improvement over other makes we looked at.  From a driver's standpoint, I am having trouble getting used to a middle console.  I miss the floor space in my minivan.  I also do not care for the steering wheel.  It doesn't adjust very much.  I do love the adjustable gas pedal and brake pedal.  This keeps me from having to sit so close to the steering wheel, making the airbag safer. ","All of the cubbies for stuff and the adjustable foot pedals.  I also love the way it looks, and the fact that it's a less popular crossover.  I don't see my vehicle coming and going like I did with my minivan.  ","Definitely needs a steering wheel with adjustments up, down, in and out. I also do not like the gas tank on the right side of the vehicle.  Maybe this is a Ford thing, but I have never owned a vehicle with the tank on the right.

I am a part time coach, and need the room, because it is hard to estimate how many players I need to get to and from the games including their equipment. I have the 7 passenger seating. The fold down seats make it a breeze for all seating/cargo possibilities. Plenty of power, (even fully loaded), the AWD is has never let us down, (even in a raging blizzard of snow and ice).

I had a 4X4 Expedition, and this car plows through all road conditions like a big SUV, but has crisp handling, and shorter braking distances.","Would like to see the climate control buttons up higher in the dash to make them easier to see while driving, or use the old rotary dials to adjust temperature, and heat/cooling direction."
4.75,Just a great car,reeger ,01/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"We purchased a used 2008 X Eddie AWD for a song. I guess Ford's poor decision not to market this car is a big plus for the pre-owned market. My wife loves it, period. Other than the noisy Perelli tires the car drives great.

We did experience paying less at the pump for obvious reasons.  With only 5900 miles on the car, however, the engine has now been torn apart twice with 9 parts being replaced, including the gaskets, valves, and the housing.  Initial indications were a timing issue around a phaser.  Seven and a half weeks later and two car payments for air, the car is finally fixed.  We will see what the future brings...probably a Toyota!","Theatre seating & independent wheel control.  I'd love to try the independent wheel control, but the dealer has had the car all winter...so far. ",I'm guessing an engine that does not fall apart while driving.  Not a real trustworthy car.

I had been aware of this Ford design since it debuted as the '05 Freestyle. Found a pristine '08 (19K mi) at the dealer, test-drove it several times and finally bought it.  It's hard to imagine a more versatile daily driver -- RAV4 and CRV, maybe.  What is just amazing to me is how incompetently Ford marketed and advertised this vehicle. We've received nothing but compliments and admiring questions from total strangers, and they invariably say ""Never heard of it."" Sadly, Ford is killing production in Feb 2009 after only two model years.  This is tragic and stupid.

EPA numbers (17/24) are almost exactly what we get, although careful and sensible highway cruising may squeeze a little more.

4.875,The Name Sold Me,julie ,01/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Owned a Taurus sadan for 10 years, looked for replacement, found X, love it. We have had it just over a year and wouldn't have changed it. When it is clean it sparkles (Black shows everything) We added a tow hitch and it is great to tow small trailer for vacations. We have owned a Ford for the past 20 years and will continue it quality continues. Gas mileage runs about 21-24 mpg, with living in a rual area. ","I love the heated seats, the dual control heating. Kids can control what they want- cooling or heating. Husband loves Sirius radio. I like the push button to lift middle seat to get in back. We had car 5 months before we found it.

The second row seats are an easier height to get into than a van, but I miss the armrests, as my Taurus X doesn't have them. I was told mileage would be 25-30 on highway, but I don't get that good.  About 23.3 catches me most of the time as I live in a rural area, and do small-town driving plus some highway. I have only driven about 4000 miles so far, and have had no problems.","Engine is pretty snappy, turning radius is very good, interior is nice.

The Eddie Bauer comes in two tone and has a distictive look. I love the car but one has to understand that with all this it is not going to get 30 miles to the gallon, I am seeing what they say around 24 on the road.

4.875,Wife and I pleased with the X,George Skeirik ,09/17/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"Purchased our X a month ago. Loved it on the test drive but now even more so. We traded a 2004 Mountaineer AWD V8 which we enjoyed quite a bit, but was heavy on gas ( it avg. 14.8 mpg winter - 16.5 mpg summer ). We're averaging 21.4 mpg with the X. Straight highway driving the X gets 26+ mpg and it's very spirited. There are a lot more storage bins and cup holders and getting to the rear seat is very easy. Love the way the seats fold down. Ford has a winner here and I do hope they continue to make this model. But Ford also has winners with the Edge and Flex. My feeling is, the Taurus X is much better looking than the other two. ","SYNC (mp3 player ), quantity of bins and cup holders, 6 speed transmission, 50/50 third row seat, the outside visibility is excellent, the H rated Pirelli tires ( I do believe they help with the highway gas mileage ). It's just a great vehicle.","The front to back roof rails, I believe, are there for looks. Without the cross rails they're not very functional. At this price the quality of the interior material should be upgraded to be on a par with the Ford Flex. With SYNC  the radio volume can not be ajusted via the steering wheel controls."

When I got my 500 I passed on the Freestyle because it lacked power but I loved the package. The new v6 and 6 speed makes up for that sin. Smooth, powerful. This is one of the very few crossovers that drives like a sedan. Steering feel and ride is dead on.  All seating is comfortable and firm. Ergonomics are spot on. Controls are easy to use.

Car is very comfortable and spacious. I recently went on a 5 hour trip with 4 adults and 2 kids (in car seats). Packed the car full, but enough room all and plenty comfortable.

Rated at 24 mpg highway, I should reach 28 mpg the way I drive. I have only gotten near 25 mpg in limited driving but it may increase. With high gas Ford should increase fuel 2-3 mpg without problem.

The Taurus X does everything I was hoping for and more. It's fun to drive with more than enough power and superb steering and handling. The mileage is better than I expected 23 overall and 29-31 on the highway (cruise control set at 60). I opted for the cloth seats and put sheepskin covers on them- I find them to be as comfortable as my Mercedes.

4.375,"Great Car, Horrible Customer relations",rbuse46 ,05/01/2008,,,5,5,2,5,,5,5,3,5,"This car is everything I was looking for, I love it. Shortly after buying it I went on a trip and noticed a burning electrical smell, turned out the passenger side mirror mirror frame rippled and melted. Got it fixed under warranty when I got home. 2 months later, it happened again. This time, they took pics and sent them to Ford. While awaiting the outcome, the drivers side mirror started to do the same thing. Ford will not fix it.They say it's vandalism! After hours on the phone and sleepless nights, I've gotten nowhere. I've taken it to an independent body shop and they are positive that something is overheating on the inside and causing the problem. Next step is Consumer Protection.","Third row seats, overall look, quiet, great ride and comfort",Better customer service from Ford
4.5,Bang for the Buck,bandyt74 ,04/18/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"My wife and I needed a vehicle that offers great amount of space, but still remains practical. After two weeks of looking, we saw the light! The Taurus X limited. This vehicle offers great space, performance, and looks. Gas mileage isn't bad considering the amount of cargo this can carry. We also like the fact that it is not the big bulky SUV that is hard to park or fit into the average parking spot. All in all, the great thing about the Taurus X is the amount of standard features that are included. Wow! Lets just say for the competition, they are just base models for the price we paid. Great bang for the buck. Thanks Ford!","Third row, heated seats, adjustable second row, engine performance","Roof rack cross bars (not out yet), "
4.875,The best crossover nobody knows about.,UltimateX ,03/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I really like this vehicle, it drives like a car, has room for 6 adults. The kids really like their heated seats and 2nd row center console, and I really like the Sync and power liftgate. The AWD system is seamless, really the only indication that it is working is the fact that you are accelerating effortlessly in heavy snow when everyone else is spinning.  This vehicle is an ideal blend of car, mini van, wagon and SUV. I highly recommend this vehicle.",The handling is excellent for a vehicle of this type.  Power liftgate and Sync are really cool.,Hybrid or diesel option would be good.
4.875,Our New X-Car,DrRick54 ,03/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We wanted a car to replace our old Villager that was more sedan than minivan but w/ more seating than a SUV - the answer was the Taurus X.  3rd row seats are real and fits our family of 5 perfectly with lots of room for the gear (ski, scuba, camping, etc) for the long haul (Mammoth, Lake Tahoe, etc).  The new engine is smooth and does not hesitate. Good mpg for the type of car (beats 8-12 for most SUVs).","SYNC, cup holders, fold flat seats (great for sleeping when not tenting).",None
4.75,Favorite Car in Senior Years,rcoogan1 ,03/04/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I had a 2006 Ford Freestyle and loved it, but after about 35,000 miles the CVT transmission started acting up. I had it fixed, but I didn't trust it anymore...so I traded it in on the new Taurus X and I'm now in heaven. This car is even better than the Freestyle with new improvements like the better horsepower, 6 speed transmission on the AWD, heated seats in the back, easier access to the third row seats, better styling, and many other improvements. This car is my personal space for long drives to my cottage or any other excuse to drive somewhere. The sound system and navigational system is great and the comfort is the best for my bad back. I've tried Mazda & Cadillac, and Taurus X wins.",The comfort of the front seats and the navigational system along with the great sound from the Audiophile system. This car is the best value I've found for what you get. The Mazda CX-9 and the Cadillac SRX isn't nearly as comfortable to me. The only thing they have that the X doesn't is styling.,Better styling on the outside (although the inside is why I love this car and styling is very secondary to comfort for me). Also a telescoping steering wheel would be nice.
4.625,Nice,A Carr ,01/09/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,4,"We bought this car to replace our 04 Tribute.  It gets marginally less gas mileage - about 22 overall vs 25 for the Mazda.  But it has much more room, is much more comfortable, rides more smoothly, and carries more cargo/passengers.  It all - a hit, a palpable hit.  Like other raters, I wish mileage were better, but this is a large vehicle, rather boxy, with a big engine. If you need 30 mpg, get a smaller car...or wait for the hybrid.",Effortless driveability. Smooth shifting 6 speed AT hardly ever makes its presence known. The 3.5 L engine is a winner.,"Make the rear seat console easier and more intuitive to open.  Also, the console is not flush with the floor so you can't lay long object flat without balancing them on it. "
4.875,My Wife Loves Her Taurus X,Wilson ,01/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We purchased our Taurus X last month and immediately loved it.  We took a 500 mile round trip and received many compliments along the way. Kids love the interior, especially the third row. Comfortable ride, roomy, and peppy. Would have liked the DVD option, but couldn't find one in a low optioned SEL model available on a dealer's lot. Gas mileage is in the low 20's for combined driving currently, but I anticipate that it will get better in the summer after the engine is broken in.",Convenience package with 6-Disc changer is good. Overall vehicle packaging and utility is great!,Gas mileage is always good to improve.
4.875,Well kept secert,Rick1951 ,01/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I orginally was looking at the Ford Edge. I saw the Taurus X and was very impressed. After a test ride and long hours of research I decided on the Taurus X. Fun to drive, quiet and completely comfortable. Handles fantastic. Performance is amazing. The seating designed really sold me. The 2nd row bucket seats are amazing. Every crossover should have these seats. I was never a Ford person, but I love my new Taurus X. Ford needs to get it to the public, lots more advertising and it will be a great seller. This is a quality American made car.","Power, performance, seating, quality workmanship. Clean lines and design.",Roof rack should be standard. 
4.75,Excellent Family Car,G. Ralph Moseley ,01/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"We chose this car because it has an easily accessible third row of seats.  Even my mom could operate them.  Plus, the seats in the third row fold down easily and give a lot of cargo room.  An aside, we purchased the WeatherTech mats and a cargo area mat and have been very pleased with them-- it's very muddy where we live.  As for build quality, it's decent.  The doors always look open.  The ride is smooth and merging onto busy/fast roads is no big deal.  Handling is proficient.  Other makes might have a better finish, but I wasn't willing to spend another $10-15K to get the same car with a flashier hood ornament.  In all, I would highly recommend this car.","Park distance warning, MP3 jack in center console, plug for kids video player located right where you'd want it, easily converted third row of seats",Make the doors look closed
4.875,Ford Needs to Promote this Car!,Doug ,12/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have never owned a Ford product before but was drawn to the safety features and interior room, Very roomy for kids and gear. I think this car has a lot of Volvo in it but at a Ford price. Car feels very luxurious and solid on the road, too. I don't understand why Ford is not promoting this car more-it's a bargain given the features it has.","Virtually no road noise. Smooth engine and transmission. Looks good and has loads of interior room. Airbags galore, AWD, Dual climate control.",You would think that a 3.6L V6 would get better than 15 MPG on average. Maybe it will get better with time as I only have 1000 miles on the car.
4.625,08 Taurus X review,flufflebug ,12/16/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,3,5,"We purchased this vehicle after our 2005 Ford Freestyle lease was up.  The Taurus X is the Freestyle with a lot of improvements. After 4 months of driving it, I am very pleased with our purchase.  I thought I would miss the smoothness of the Freestyle's CVT but I don't miss it at all.  The Taurus X's transmission is very smooth, the ride is very quiet and the engine is very peppy.",I can see out the rear-view mirror with DVD player in use (improvement over Freestyle).  Love the two-tone interior and heated leather seats.  My husband loves the ride.  It's very car-like.  It doesn't feel like you are driving such a large vehicle.,Better mileage please!  I get the same mileage with my FWD Taurus X as I did with my AWD Freestyle.  I was hoping for better.  Fit and finish isn't perfect.  There are some gaps in body panels. Dual climate control is confusing as is Triptunes for Ipod.
5,From Cobra to X,crafty ,10/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We have 2500 miles on the X and it is so much fun to drive. We are Grandparents, My wife thinks I disguised the 2003 Cobra we traded in on the X as it is Very Quick! Mileage is 24 now but will get better as 30,000 miles roles up. Road holding ability is super and no effort needed to drive. We use the rear part for hauling and it has more room than you think. All in all we think we are going to be very happy with our ""X""","18"" chrome wheels, zip, snap & go, comfort, and style",Fuel mileage but it's not bad at 24
4.875,Taurus X - Amazing,Ron Davis ,10/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The Taurus X was an instant wow! Luxurious ride, refined interior, exclusion of road noise. You can't hear someone standing outside of the vehicle talking to you even when the vehicle is shut down and all systems are off! This thing floats over the bumps with its extended wheelbase and handles better than any vehicle that we test drove with the exception of the Landrover LR2 which also handled equally as well. My wife who's afraid to drive anything too big says it drives like a large sedan. We bought the limited version for just a few hundred over invoice and have no regrets. If you must fit 3 in the second row of the vehicle this is the only vehicle that can make everyone comfortable.","Refined ride, plenty of pickup, no road noise, smooth shifting through the gears, easy to drive, car like ride, luxurious interior, uses regular gasoline","Make the moonroof bigger like the Ford Edge's. Add cross bars to the roof rack, improve mpg (we know that you can do better than 16 mpg city and 24 highway) make a hybrid electric version. "
5,Love the Taurus X and our 06 FreeStyle,Navycpowif ,09/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We have owned this car for 3 weeks now and love it just as much as our 2006 Ford FreeStyle. We have owned an Explorer,Windstar and traded our 2005 F150 extra crew Lariet for this Taurus and now have the Freestyle and the Taurus X in the driveway. These cars hold a $400 to 500 shopping spree to Sam's club and still the 2 kids. with a breeze. We just have to decide which one to take. Gas mileage has been great. Pickup is wonderful can really tell the difference on the Taurus X.  Love my push button back lid opening. And my husband loves the Freestyle as much as his truck- Loves the gas mileage even better.  You have to get the Taurus X. Will tow and packs a lot!","Pick up and go. Mileage saver, entertainment center, serious music package, remote back lid door. Lots of room.",Entertainment center monitors in the headrests. 
4.375,Initial Impressions - Great Car,ACarr ,09/23/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,4,4,4,4,"We upgraded an 04 Tribute for the Taurus X. The X is quieter, has more cargo and people space, has all the safety features standard, and gets about the same mileage - we got 25 mpg on our 40 mi drive home with the car.  Fit and finish look fine. Nice ride.","Compared to our 04 Tribute, the ride is the best feature. It's quite smooth and quiet on the highway. Not much wind noise. Very little engine noise.",Power passenger seats with lumbar should be standard rather than an option.  
5,High five Ford!,jigmaster ,09/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Had my TX for a month now, 1500 miles on it. Very happy with purchase, did lots of research on crossovers and test drives ( tested Acadia,Outlook,Suzuki XL7, Mazda CX9 ) and TX was the best handling and most fun car to drive. Plus price and fuel economy is the best as well. Don't understad how some drivers are driving  if they geting lower MPG than advertised? Hello, whats about using cruise control and other fuel saving tips? I am getting 24mpg average, althought I must admit I drive 70-80% on highway. But even in city never got less then 18.5MPG. But of course if you like to push gas pedal to the floor  and strain that new 3.5 lt engine all the time, than thats what you get;)","Comfy ride and steering wheel, plenty of room and storage space, easy and useful controls. Mirror has something in it which makes lights from cars who drive behind at night soft green and easy on your eyes. Kids love DVD!","Cross bars on roof rack should be standard, because it is not easy to find proper ones to fit on. There should be darker cloth seat color available, now it is nice but to light and easy to stain. "
4,So Far So Good,DJR ,08/29/2007,,,5,3,4,4,,4,5,3,4,"I've had the X for about two weeks now and I've really enjoyed it.  The main issue with its predecessor, the FreeStyle was that it was underpowered.  This has been corrected with the new X.  Unfortunately the mpg has suffered;  I'm getting significantly less than the 19 mpg comparison figure or the 16 city mpg listed.  The crossover has been surprisingly responsive, the braking smooth,and the ride comfortable.  There is a few fit and finish issue with the running board but it is not major.  I upgraded with leather and the DVD entertainment system and am very happy with both.  The utility is great as the third row seats fold flat with a very quick and easy 3 step process.  Good job Ford.","The ability to easily and effortlessly configure the cargo area, the DVD entertainment system, and the ample storage areas including on the dash.  Good acceleration from a standstill and from 30 mph.","The new handsfree Sync system was not available when I ordered.  There was no option for a universal garage door remote (Homelink).  The glasses holder and convex mirror, while great features, look cheap and don't seem to fit properly.  Offer solid color SEL exterior options instead of the two- tone"
