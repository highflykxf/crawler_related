4.875,Love it!,lynel27 ,03/11/2011,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We bought our Entourage June of 08' and we have 3 little ones including on with special needs that uses a wheelchair and walker...it has suited us all well.We love how comfy it is and the only thing we wish we had gotten now is the built in DVD player.,"Accelerates well--even while trying to pass on hwy.
It has been very reliable for us and comfy to ride in.
Love the leg room.","Occasionally, the side doors sometimes won't open all the way--they are not powered--and so we have to manually adjust it for it to open all the way.
That has been the only issue and we could have it looked at--just haven't had time.

4.875,Great Van,joekar2 ,12/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Purchased new in July 09 as a dealership car with 10,000 miles. Just finished 10 week 9,500 mile trip, and could not be happier with this van. Plenty of room, comfortable, handled great (including mountain roads. More accessories than I even needed. Gas mileage was very good, 21.4 overall. City has been about 17.1 and highway has varied between 20.5 to 24.5.  Only issue was with AC. Clicking on and off, but was fixed under warranty in another state than I purchased car in.  My second Hyundai, and have been very pleased with warranty and performance.  Is the top of the line.........NO! But price for what you get is superior to anything out there. Not to mention the warranty.",Great stereo system. Lots of room. Handled great. Very smooth. Engine performed great even while climbing up mountain roads. Free oil changes and washes if taken back to original dealer. DVD player for grandchildren. (Which I had this for my kids back then.),"Would have liked 18"" tires instead of max of 17"". Electric adjustable seat for passenger seat."
4.75,Wish I could afford another,Oilmover ,12/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"After 5 months of exhausting research, shopping and driving them all, I was convinced the Entourage was the best. Now after 8 months of owning the van I wish I could afford a 2nd one. It's very quick, quiet and comfortable. MPG avg 18-19 around town and 22-24 hwy. An all around excellent vehicle that I feel very safe putting my family in. Check out the crash photos on the NHTSA site. Impressive.  Even though I chose the Hyundai, I'm glad Kia\Hyundai settled on one van. I don't believe re-badging the same vehicle makes sense. My 2nd one will have to be a loaded-up Sedona EX.",Headlights are excellent. 250+ HP engine is very quick. Back up sensors are great for parking lots and parallel parking.,Larger gas tank. Diesel option to increase mileage and driving range.
4.875,Can't believe I love a van,A new mom ,08/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We have taken two trips with this van and love it. The room is great especially considering we have a 6 month old. Miss my controls on the steering wheel and my auto headlights that my other car had, but I am getting used to the lack of these features. Gas mileage could be better. Wish we could have afforded the upgraded model, but love van overall. ","Safety features were a huge plus for us, all the extra room is great, fun to drive overall love it","Auto headlights, more radio controls on steering wheel, better gas mileage"
5,new entourage,Morpheus0052 ,08/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my entourage 6 months ago, limited. it is the best part of our trip, everyone is comfortable, room for things cups you name it. the trunk always has space to spare, not mentioning the center area in the rear, the side space between the seats and the door is grand. and the dvd system blows me away. besides it has inputs for consoles or anything else. it is by far the most quiet, stable, economic, fun to ride and drive and powerful (consider the engine size) car that I have ever ridden. I cant wait to take another trip. and for everyday use in the city. economy is better than the competition.",everything. specially cargo room and the dvd and sunroof,"the rear seats need more lumbar support for adults. the second row should have the option of a seat in the middle, or a 3 person bucket. and the speaker system is good but can be improved. specially for stereo."
5,HIGHWAY CRUISER ,H. Kraz ,06/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is my third Hyundai purchase and I am sold on their quality .... Zero problems,Powerful stereo system .. memory seats .. Very good gas mileage considering 4000+ vehicle weight Never got less then 18mpg city ... 27 mpg hgwy ,Don't like the flip down tray between front seats I would rather had a console ... 
4.875,So far so good,So far so good ,06/12/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Bought this vehicle three weeks ago at an awesome price since they are discontinuing it.  Couldn't beat the price and all the features we got.  Been very happy with it so far seeing as how I didn't want another minivan.,"The built in DVD, excellent stereo system, pretty interior design.",Third row is a little squishy.  Not sure what was up with that middle seat in the third row.
4.75,Too Bad Hyundai Axed the Entourage,clex2 ,06/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"So after almost 5 months of ownership, I can say that I am truly impressed with the Entourage.  All the forum complaints on the power doors, wheel vibration, battery drain, and gas mileage have not been part of my experience.  They van has been flawless since day one, except for a crooked Entourage emblem and broken conversation mirror, both of which were fixed under warranty.  If they still made the Entourage, I would be recommending it to everyone.  I guess the Kia Sedona is the equivalent, but from what I've read, the Entourage is a little bit more upscale, although at a slight increase in cost. If you can still find one, I bet you can get a great deal on this great minivan.","It's unique considering that when we go out, we will see dozens of Odysseys, Siennas, and Dodge/Chryslers.  Powerful, smooth, quiet, and comfortable.  Tilting side mirrors when reversing.  Power rear popout rear windows.  Impressive 13 speaker Infinity 660W sound system.","I would suggest Hundai keep producing the Entourage.  The Sedona will have to suffice for now.  A hybrid version would put this van over the top and would no doubt drastically improve sales.  Even without a hybrid, this van can stand toe to toe with Honda and Toyota."
1.375,BAD WARRANTY,wizardsrepair ,05/29/2009,,,1,2,1,1,,2,2,1,1,I bought this vehicle in March of 2009 and in the first two weeks I noticed a discoloring in the headlight lens which I was told would not be replaced under the warranty and now I am sitting at two month mark and I am having problems with my driver's seat rocking and popping and now I am being told that yjis also will not be a warranty repair. I will never buy another Hyundai again.,None,Start honoring the warranty
4.875,Happy,Mark ,05/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have taken my van on two long distance trip, I am very satisfied.  The comfort and handling is very good.  Fun to drive...trip computer rear sensors great features...I wish I would of upgraded to receive the power gate.  The back do not always close properly when loaded.","I love the convenience of the stowing away of the back seats.  Managing the controls in the steering column and the compass is a plus.  The sound system is a plus, the surround sound is great. ","Improve the gas mileage for local driving, build in extra storage in the back sliding doors, and put a usb port in the vehicle."
2.875,Entourage,Hyundai?? ,05/22/2009,,,3,4,3,3,,3,3,1,3,I find the Van to be acceptable for the price and features.  Nothing fancy to it.  Good enough for my family of 5.,"Three zone climate control, power side doors and all of the safety equipment.  Fold away rear seats.","I would have a power tailgate as well as the side doors, Seek button on the steering wheel for radio.  Sotw and go 2nd row seats like th rear."
4.375,Great family car!,Love it ,05/13/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,3,I never thought I would drive a minivan but I actually like this one. It is a great family vehicle and it rides very nice.,"Comfy,love the automatic doors, Love the beep detection for the rear.","lighted mirrors, sometimes the automatic doors don't close right"
3.75,Our experience.....,Shannan ,01/02/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,2,4,"We have had our Entourage for over a year, and have been overall happy with our van. As a family with 5 children, we give two thumbs up for spaciousness and being comfortable. I love the deep well in the rear for grocery shopping day. The two side auto doors are so helpful! I have found the gas mileage to be horrible at 17 mpg on the hywy. Also, I do not like that every time I fill up the van with gas....without warning, when it is full, gas spews out! I have to be careful. ","side auto doors, space, comfort, the fold down mirror that lets me keep an eye on whats going on in the back! the way the seats come out and fold down to make room for hauling different items. ","On my old van I had a mode and scan button on the center of the steering wheel, I miss having that scan button! please make the gas mileage better.....and what is going on when I fill up the gas tank?"
5,Better than other minivan,will ,10/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Good looking exterior and excellent mileage. 14~16 mpg in city, 26~30 mpg on Hwy.  Detaching middle seats is not easy but it give me very spacious cabin, very useful for loading so many things like sofa. ",good mileage and exterior.,"why don't they make foldable middle seats like ""stow-and-go"" of Chrysler."
4.75,Really great luxury  van,Stacy H ,10/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I purchased my Hyundai van 2 months ago and have been very happy with the way it drives. It is very comfortable inside as well. I love the automatic side doors and the automatic back hatch door. It has a very smooth ride and great pick-up-and-go. But, the gas mileage is terrible. I expected to get at least 15mpg as advertised, but I only get at best 12.5mpg around town. Apparently that is what most owners are learning. Overall I am extremely satisfied with the Entourage. I hope Hyundai is able to improve the gas mileage in the future.",Large front windshield. Automatic doors. Windows that roll down on side doors. Smooth ride. ,Gas Mileage
4.875,Awesome minivan for the price!,Matt ,07/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We purchased our 2008 Entourage a few weeks ago and love it! The ride is smooth and the space inside is roomy.Hyundai seems like there heading in the right direction, the only downside is the fuel mileage. But were very happy and would definitely recommend it before 34k Honda Odyssey!",The Entire minivan is enjoyable ride and it has great pick up from 0-60 mph.For the price you can't get a better minivan!,Hyundai needs to improve it's fuel mileage on the entourage.
4.375,Hyundai 2008 Entourage Limited,Southern Comfort ,06/06/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"Overall we have found the van acceptable.  Having traded a Pontiac ssei sedan for the van beacuse of medical reasons we've found many of the amenities of the sedan lacking in the van and not available as an option.  However, for the task of carrying medical equipment it is acceptable.  The large amount of room is pleasing.  Gas mileage isn't great, especially for a 250 hp engine.  The sedan got 19 mpg in town, 23 mpg on the highway and was a 3.8l, turbocharged 276 hp engine.  ",Automatic doors Power outlets Luggage rack Ease of access and egress,"Things we miss: Built-in, programmable garage door opener. Auxiliary input to the radio (for iPod). Heads up display. Higher contrasting numbers/letters - During bright days the dash is difficult to see. We loved the sedans bright orange letters/numbers. Built-in electrical tire pump and hose."
4.875,Very pleased,cookiewm ,12/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Only have had the van for 2 weeks but we are loving it.  The room, the drive.  So far so good.",The room and the automatic doors,Too soon to say.
4.75,love it,david weber ,11/16/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"only had the van for three weeks but love the way it handles and very surprize of the pick up this van has for it its size.to change the oil,the filter is on the top of the motor,I never saw that before.","favorite feature is all the room there is in this van,and the way the dash board is laid out,easy to reach everything","I really can't think of any thing,except maybe the second row of seats could sink down in the floor like the thied row doese"
