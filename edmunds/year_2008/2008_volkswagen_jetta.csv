4.5,2008 Jetta Wolfsberg Edition,ilchqb11 ,08/18/2013,,,5,5,4,5,,5,4,3,5,"I bought my Jetta brand new at 0 miles and just yesterday I passed 100,000 miles and I have to say this is by far the best car I have ever owned; however, some people don't realize that owning and maintaining a VW takes a little bit of work. In order to make sure your vehicle lasts a long time it is vital that you stay up-to-date with recommended maintenance and NEVER get work done at a location other then a licensed Volkswagen dealership. If you follow those 2 simple rules you will be more than happy. I've heard horror stories about people buying a Jetta and having terrible experiences with it; yet they never really took the effort to take care of it or take it in for routine maintenance. ","My favorite features about the 2.0T FSI engine is the amount of aftermarket work you can put into it that makes it run even smoother and longer including ECU upgrades, exhaust system upgrades (that will NEVER rust), brakes, etc. Personally I would recommend using APR products because of the fact it doesn't compromise daily drivability. The interior is also fabulously built with quality materials; not like the fake noisy plastic you find on most imports. ","If there is one complaint about the car that I have to give it would be the suspension. The stock suspension makes you feel every bump/crack on the road which in turn creates a very bumpy ride. I was fooled at first because of my older car but after about 60,000 miles my back began to feel the difference; and now at 100,000 miles I'm beginning to look at new suspension kits to see if I can create a smoother ride. The upside to this though is once I replace it it will last forever. Take care of your Jetta and it WILL take care of you. "

4.25,third times a charm??,5peedornospeed ,10/12/2011,,,4,4,3,4,,5,5,4,5,"my mom has had Jettas as her past two cars (a 1997 with 170,000 and a 2002 currantly with 100000 on it) both cars have never given any problems out of the normal range of expected maintanence so i decided on the 2008 jetta s as my next car. so far im very impressed, i got it with 54000 miles on it and it now has 62000. i have only owned the car a month. the first week i had it i took it from RI, to NC to CO(phish) and back to RI. the car isnt old enough for me to judge reliability but so far everything seems solid and the car seems very well built. i will update this review once i have put some real milage on the car. ","the stock stereo is very impressive, solid bass and very clear sound quality. the ride is smooth and the car is extremely comfortable to sit in. the transmition (5 speed manual) shifts smoothly and as with all VW's is very solid. for the cars size and power it gets great gas milage with an average of 34 highway and about 24-27 with city/highway combined. the car is responsive, has great handeling, and excellant pickup. it also has a massive tunk space. ","the first day i had the car the rear passengers side door lock actuator stopped working. since the cars systems are all electronic this was a major problem. thankfully the dealership fixed this problem for me free of charge. my only suggestion would be to add the manual lock feature back into the car, this way even if the electronics stop working you can still lock and unlock the doors. getting the actuator replaced would have cost me almost $1000, and in the city i feel that it is important to be able to lock your car. i personaly dont have $1000 floating around to fix a door lock so it would be nice to have a fall back so i could have the time to save up for the repair if need be.

It's super cute, fun to dart in and out of traffic with and it had a great ""giddy up"" to it. Within the first year I started having mechanical issues with the car not starting. I took it to my local Firestone and got the battery, starter, alternator, and ignition checked out and I got a green light on everything. The next day I made an appointment with the VW dealershipand they were just as unconcerned and rude as they could be.

Icy roads sent me into a guard rail head first then spun around and slammed into my driver's side... at 35-40mph. No steering wheel airbag deployment... No side airbag deployment. The metal in the car crumpled like tin foil and all of it's plastic parts shattered like glass. Two weeks later I recieved a letter in the mail stating the transmission was being recalled and the winshield wiper plastic was cutting into the fuel lines causing them to leak.

The automatic transmission has manual and sport modes which work well...the manual mode allows you to select whatever gear of the 6 you want and the sport mode will noticeably increase throttle response, hold gears longer before upshift and downshift to lower gears at higher rpm's.
Overall, the car works and performs very well and has been reliable as the sun coming up.
On top of that, it is a good looking car inside and out.","Only gripe with 2008 Jetta SE:
The in-line 5 cylinder engine sounds thrashy but it is very smooth and as stated earlier returns good mileage and decent performance.

4.375,3 year lease end love it/hate it still pt. 1,vincef329 ,01/27/2011,,,5,4,4,3,,5,5,4,5,"I have leased my salsa red Jetta SE for almost 3 years now, mileage up to 32,000. I originally wrote the love it/hate it review and want to expand on that. Styling is still modern after 3 years, still a good looking car inside and out. The leatherette still looks great as all other interior components do also, even the carpet. I live in the NE so the carpet sees its fair share of wet and snowy shoes, still cleans up well. No problems with any interior components, all are like new. Exterior paint has chipped considerably, how very sad. Seems only the red paint suffered this as I have ""red"" about it on the internet. Above the rear license plate the paint has completely come off and rust has","started to perferate the metal. If I had bought this car I would really be mad at VW. VW will have to decide how to deal with this mess. If it wasn't for the paint chipping I would seriously consider keeping this car. Reliability has also suffered slightly since I had a PCU failure at 22000 miles. The dealer where I bought the car couldn't even take the car for a week! I found another dealer that took it right in and still had to wait 5 days to get it back. No loaner from this location and VW did a partial reimbursment for the cost of the rental. No problem with any other mechanical components and ride, brakes, and engine power are just like new. Mileage is directly related to the pressure","produced by my right foot. I am happy and surprised to report that after 3 years, I'm just as thrilled to hop in and drive as I was on day 1, the driving is still great. The only downside is that mushbag of a transmission. Slow and late shifting keeps the capable engine from moving the Jetta a little faster. It's worth noting that the stock tires are worthless in the snow so I would recommend snow tires in the winter.

Overall, after 3 years I'm satisfied enough with the Jetta to consider a new one (among other VWs and other makes) in 2 months."

I would not recommend a jetta to anyone.  I put on Bridgestone Blizzack tires to try to improve the terrible winter performance to no avail.  You would think a car from Germany could handle some snow. The traction control system is a joke and noise maker.

With that said however, acceleration at higher speeds is greater but just wish it had more ""punch"" from a stop. The interior is well-built and controls intuitive.

More recently this past summer at 18,000 miles some connectors in the fuse box shorted out. This took 2 days in the shop for them to figure this out.  Now I'm having different warning lights come on and off. The fuel cap warning light was of, then off.  Today the tire pressure light is on, though the tires all look to be inflated properly.  What next?!?",Comfortable interior. Decent power.,Reliability is terrible. I'm glad of leasing. Can't wait to get rid of it. Gas Mileage isn't great either. 27 MPG Hwy for the MT.  Needs to have a 6spd manual instead of the 5spd.

My only complaint is the cost of oil changes!  $75 for my first and $80 something for my second.  Are you kidding me?

Their stance is that everyone's brakes wear out at different rates.  The CSR on the phone is the final say...there is no supervisor you can speak with.  I've never heard of them wearing out at 14K miles.  The underlying cause:  Parking brake out of adjustment.  Now who would have thought to check the brake cable on a brand new car?

It is great to drive around town or cross country.  I have driven a lot of cars in my life and I don't believe you can get a better value for the money than a Jetta. It may not be the best at any one thing but overall It does everything well.  For the price of the vehicle this is pretty hard to beat.,Interior design is superb. The car is just fun to drive. The trunk is wonderful for a car this small. Acceleration and handling are excellent. Gas mileage has been great.

Jettas had a bad rep a few years ago for electrical problems but that appears to have been worked out. However I do have an annoying rattle on the dash and its a bit noisy on the freeway.  It is a very fun car to drive and handles well in snow/ice even though I have low profile performance tires. TIP: if you are trying to get out of the snow then turn off ASR! It's a great safety feature when you're driving but if you need to get un-stuck then you don't want it on!  I love the blue lit dash at night and the red lights that beam down from the roof.

I stumbled across an 08 Wolfsburg w 5k, priced at $16.5k on the internet.  The next morning, I headed to the dealership and fell in love with it after the first drive. Loved all of the Wolfsburg add ons, especially the 2.0 Turbo! I never thought I would love driving a Jetta, but I do! I find it more fun to drive than my Camaro. To add to that, I have been averaging 30 MPG hwy as well. My only issue is an annoying rattle from the dash moulding.","The Wolfsburg Edition presents a tremendous value. It gets great MPG, the DSG Automatic and especially the sport mode performance combined with the 2.0 Turbo is fantastic! I also like the Wolfsburg Wheels and Spoiler.

The very responsive engine coupled with 18"" performance tires made this car fun to drive.  Just two months later and the clutch has way too much transmission feel and the gas consumption is not even close to the quoted technical specifications.  Unless my dealer can solve the consumption issue I am estimating that this car will cost me $400-500 more per year than I should expect based on quoted estimates. In terms of the clutch, the feel has drastically changed from when I first took delivery.  My dealer is claiming that it is operating normally.  I hope this is not a sign of things to come.

Mileage is so so, mine is right on the EPA estimate of 21-22 city, and 29 highway.  Ride is smooth, and steering precise.  Just enought road feed back to be useful to the driver.  Driver seat should be wider, it is a little narrow in the seat, and I am not fat, just average size.  Radio could be a bit stronger, and the ipod connector should be on the dash.  If the Jetta just got slightly over 30 MPG, and slightly higher mileage in town it would be one of the best small to mid size cars. Plenty of interior space for 4 persons, 5 is a reach.  The trunk is longer than my Camry.","Solid build quality, huge trunk, good pickup, smooth quiet ride, excellent interior quality, good new car tires.

Mileage is as one would expect with a 2.5 engine-glad to see they are starting to import diesels these are the way to go for fuel efficiency and the reason Europeans are getting 50+ miles to the gallon! It also feels SOLID-I feel safe in this small car. Enormous space in the trunk.

Looking back, I wish I'd only discovered VW's earlier.  The handling and performance of my Jetta Wolfsburg reminds me very much of that BMW 330Ci I once owned, but at less than HALF the price of the Beemer.  The Jetta is truly the best VALUE;  I've never been so satisfied.  I'm getting much more for the price I paid.

Oil change ran 60 bucks at the dealer.  Seems very maintenance friendly.  MPG about 25 city driving. I'm not a lead foot so I think it is pretty reasonable.  The only thing lacking is that I originally wanted a hatchback to haul stuff.  I don't have the storage space I need, but after all it is a sedan.

Of course the inevitable happened & the sales manager approached me.  So, I ended up test driving a 2.5 and a 2.0T WE which I absolutely fell in love with.

I am coming out of a BMW and was looking at the usual suspect luxury cars - there all nice but nothing made me go wow.  When i test drove this car on a whim i knew in 5 minutes that i wanted it. The 2.0 turbo is a rocket!  I chose the wolfsberg over the gli just because i wanted something that looked a little more grown up - and the rims and tires on this car make it look very nice.   For the money there is nothing that can even touch this car - its super fun to drive - great styling- ton of options -  well built -and did i mention its super fast! Only 12.5k sent to US- pick one up if you can find one!,"Interior styling, engine, handling, etc etc",Only thing i wish they had was radio controls on steering wheel.

Much roomier interior and cargo. Back seats have dual climate control, armrest with cup holders, and plenty of legroom for two full-size adults. Thw Wolfsburg comes with everything you'd need: 6-CD in-dash, MP3 adapter, power moonroof, sporty wheels.",Seats are much improved. Bottom of seat comes out far behind backs of legs/knees. You feel like you're shoehorned into a racing seat. Handling is TIGHT! Feels like an Audi A4.

This is probably the cheapest car from VW/Audi with this fun-to-drive engine and transmission combo.  For a few hundred more than a SE, this is a no-brainer choice.  The 200 hp is available around 1800 rpm, so you truly get use of the power without having to floor it.  I have about 1500 miles to date and have my fingers crossed that there will be no issues down the road.  But, the fit and finish of this car are remarkable.

5,This car saved my life....really,Amanda  ,03/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I can not say enough about my Jetta. I bought my Jetta only 4 months ago and last Friday night someone ran a stop sign going 60 mph and I was traveling 65 mph...and I slammed into him. I am a single mother of 3 children, all three of my children were in that car. We all walked away with bruises from the seat belts that is it! Today the insurance comp. told me my car is totaled. It was amazing how the VW absorbed the hit. The highway patrol told me I made a smart choice in cars. Needless to say I will be getting a new Jetta as soon as all this insurance stuff is over. Can not say enough!","crash safety, heated seats, love the blue/purple dash lights, turn signal on side mirrors","would love to see the radio controllers on the steering wheel. would like to have the choice of air on my feet and front, there is no choice of both just either or."

It is absolutely the best car on the market for the price paid. The interior feels luxurious. The drive is excellent - smooth and confident. Lots of power, legroom, headroom, ample trunk space. I have a base model, but I do not feel a need for anything that is not there. A true engineering marvel for this price.","Roominess (I am 6'5"" tall), interior design, build quality, great ride and handling, many options in the base model, absolutely great value!!!",1. The honk sound after locking the car using the remote is unpleasant. My old jetta had nicer sound. 2. Archaic passenger seatback adjustment circular knob is extremely hard to reach and operate 3. Radio reception is subpar 4. Fuel gauge is non-linear. When it shows 1/2 full you only have 1/3.

I really enjoy driving it. Even the S was enough. Wheel upgrades are a must over the hideous hubcaps. Buy some online or upgrade at the dealer to one of the VW wheels. I went with the 17"" Goal wheels and they are awesome looking. Make the car complete. Also added the silver taillights, What a good look that is.","iPod adapter is great. Don't car for the location. Standard radio could be better, so upgrade that and add Sirius like I did. Well worth it.",So far nothing really top complain about. Like everything about it and plan to keep it for a while. That's a big statement from me. Longest I've ever kept a car was 18 months.

It is my first new car, so I am enjoying the new car smell :) I traded in my Acura 3.2 CL Type S, so I do feel like I am missing a little bit of power. The Jetta seems a bit sluggish.

5,Great Car For A Great Price,Lee ,03/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Wow! This car is very fun to drive, has lots of power (I have 2.0L Turbo). Handling is crisp and the ride is very smooth. The interior design is much more than I would expect for car at this price point. Anyone looking for a car in this price range needs to test drive one of these. German cars are not only well thought out, they just handle better. Heated seats are great in the winter. The car even does all right in the snow, where the traction control makes a very noticeable difference. There are also several well thought out innovations to the car which make simple things more convenient.","Sound system on the SE and up is decent and should easily please the average listener and perhaps the above average as well. Being able to have the windshield's wipers stop in the up position when the car off is nice too, especially in the winter.

I like the fact that the basic model looks practically the same inside and out.  I opted for the ""Titanium"" package, which included the 17"" wheels and rear spoiler, and it was definitely worth the price because the wheels really make the car.  You would never know that it is a base model when seeing it drive by.","I love the iPod adapter.  However, I don't understand why it is in the glove box.  It would be much better somewhere on the dash or console.  And also the optional 17"" wheels, highly recommended to make your car an eye catcher.","I went with the black interior and my only complaint is that it is impossible to keep clean.  I find myself constantly picking lint from the seats that won't come off with the vacuum.  But, no biggie.  It would also be nice to have the splash guards standard on the car. I put them on after one week."

Has the look and feel of a much more expensive vehicle at an affordable price.  I think the biggest criticism I've heard about the car is the exterior styling being too similar to the Toyota Corolla. I think the roofline and silhouette of the car is more sophisticated compared to the Corolla. The new tail lights for 2008 also have a new look (VW darkened the perimeter of the tail lights, giving it a more distinctive look).  I think the interior is also top notch.  Quality materials and lots of features you won't see on the Civic or base model, midsize cars (i.e. Camry, Accord, Altima).  ","6 disc CD changer, heated mirrors/seats, sunroof, cool gauges, huge trunk, leather, German look and feel (car hugs the road and has great exhaust note), also a lot of similar components that are used in VW's sister brand, Audi. The tiptronic is also great.  Also one touch up and down windows. ",The lid to the fuel tank is made of plastic.  Why not just use steel like the rest of the car?  A flimsy feature to an otherwise great car that gives you the German experience without costing an arm and a leg.

The interior of the VW Jetta blows away the Mazda 3 since the Germans just pay so much more attention to detail.

This car has exceeded my expectations again and again. I have owned numerous European cars and have to say this car feels and drives like my Audis and Volvos, maybe even better.

All controls seem to be laid out very well.",Fun to drive quotient is definitely way up there. I volunteer to run errands just to drive this car.,"One of the few complaints that I have with the Jetta is that the center console is a bit wide in the knee area.

What is cool about the Jetta is that there are little touches that make you develop an emotional attachment to the car. I love the night time illumination. Had not seen that when I bought the car so the first time.....cool! I really like the handling and the seat heaters are great. It feels like a luxury car. I got a special edition that is metallic grey with the spoiler and very nice grey rims on low profile tires. It is a looked and I love seeing it everytime I need to go somewhere.

My initial impression is that the SEL has a solid feel and is responsive. Low end torque is a little sluggish though. Interior is nice and clean.

I was also looking for safety features and the Jetta had great crash test ratings for front and side.  I loved the Jetta SE and it suited me.  For the first time in awhile I actually felt the car hugged the road and I felt safe making corners and on freeway curves.  It handles beautifully and the interior is so comfortable.

Gas mileage is a bit less than my '00 since its a 2.5 and I had been driving a 2.0. I think the experience of driving this car will be worth the few extra dollars I'll spend in gas.

I test drove every other compact sedan just to make sure but the Jetta is head and shoulders above the competition.  Not to mention that you get sooo much for your money.  Many standard features on the VW are options on the other vehicles.  This is a classy car with great performance and comfort.  The boost in horsepower in the 2008 models is definitely nice to have. The trunk is huge! Great interior design and layout.  I can go on and on.

I did not drive the 2007 tip, but I think this runs as well as my old 2000 Passat V6/tip. I looked at the Mistu Lancer, Ford Fusion, and Hyundai Sonata. For my money, this is by far the better buy. The packaging has been changed up, and you get more as standard for the money compared to 2007. Definitely more than ""A to B"" tranportation. Very classy interior.
