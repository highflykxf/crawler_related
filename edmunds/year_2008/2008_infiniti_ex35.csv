4,More fun than FX,Jimji ,01/03/2016,,,4,,,,,4,4,,,This is a fun but luxurious car to drive which is what I wanted as my old gti was too low and dangerous for the mountains of Colorado in the Winter. Needed something I could drive all year but was still fun and wouldn't beat me up for longer drives. Tried a similar year FX and was sadly disappointed. Its possible it needed some front end work as it was used but the salesman who showed me the Ex said he thought I would notice the difference in handling over bumps in the road. He was right it was huge. The Ex also felt quicker and being smaller easier to change directions with. Both vehicles felt miles above the same year Bmw x3 which felt slow and harsher over the bumps. I am single so always just leave the rear seats folded down so the back seat room is  a non issue for me. Not sure about the handling in Winter conditions yet as my tires need replacing and hitting icy spots is kind of scary right now. The EX3 is so nice on the highway when I want to pass another car as it accelerates really well. I just wish there wasn't that slight lag before the power comes on but its reasonable. I will say that the old gti with the little turbo was more fun to ring out going up the mountain passes here. The 3.4 6 banger might actually be faster if I want it to be but it just doesn't like to be revved to the max like the little turbo and isn't quite as fun going around the turns but then it is a lot more comfortable doing it. Owned for about 9 months now. Still no problems and still liking it.,,

I average 22mpg in heavy city/hills driving so that's not bad given the 305hp V6 performance.

And with the comparative rarity, you are in the unique position of people staring admiringly at what is essentially a short sporty station wagon. Toyota/Lexus and Honda/Acura have nothing on this car from the looks department.  I love the car's split personality. When driven sedately, its like a luxo-crusier. High seating position, fine appointments, quiet ride and good stereo is made for eating thousands of miles in comfort.

Although both cars did have more space, EX35 is much more appealing to look at and more fun to drive.  This car handles and accelerates like a sports car while ride quality matches that of typical luxury sedan and braking power is very strong.  I really can't complain about this car beside its lack of space in the back which drives my wife nuts every time since she has to sit in the back with my 2 year old daughter.  But I do believe once she gets old enough to be out of her car seat, my wife will stop complaining.

I do think it would be tough to get 3 people in the back seat.  Storage is not bad and it what I expected.

It looks great in moonlight white with graphite interior, the navigation system is wonderful (my wife has no sense of direction and is not the most confident of drivers, but the sat-nav always gets her to her destination). The build quality is excellent. All-in-all, a great and exceptional buying and ownership experience so far. Long may it continue.

The car itself is a total pleasure to drive under any conditions - from ""endless"" acceleration if you floor it to very sharp handling on a curvy road, to very quiet and smooth ride on a regular street or freeway. Extremely quiet cabin and excellent Bose audio with XM makes trips much less tiresome. Cruise control that can literally stop a car when a car in front of it stops is surprisingly useful even on a city street. Voice recognition understands my accent. But above all - give it a little gas to burn and feel acceleration that presses you into the seat - it stays constant while you go from 0 to 80, I don't even feel tranny switching.  Yeah!","Laser cruise control, quiet cabin, XM/Bose audio, great engine and brakes, tall driver position in a relatively small vehicle, very comfortable seats, wood trim looks very cool.","Make it hybrid!

We have the AWD Journey model with premium and nav packages.  The biggest surprise for me is how small a change in handling and aggressiveness it was from our 4-cylinder Camry.  The EX does not feel aggressive at all, and the small turn radius keeps it from feeling like an unwieldy SUV.  Supposedly it goes from 0-60 in 6.3 seconds, and the acceleration is there when you need it, but you wouldn't expect this if you aren't pushing it hard (unlike the BMW 1-series, which even at 10 mph lets you know it is ready to rocket you into space at any moment).  But, we love how it drives!","The exterior and interior of the car look amazing.  Navigation system is great and seems to be very reliable; the voice recognition for commands also works very well so far.  Tethering a bluetooth phone was very simple, and so is maneuvering through the audio system.  BUT...",This is probably an uncommon criticism but I already notice cons with the audio system.  The only way to get mp3s on the hard drive is to record them off of audio CDs.  You can't copy mp3s from CDs or compact flash cards.

Infiniti's legal department has *really* gone overboard in limiting what you can do with your tech if you are not stopped.

Very easy car to drive, with some fun gadgets.  Gas mileage is fair 18-20 around town.  There is not much knee room in the back, and not great cup holders, also, if you put tall cups in the shorter cup holders, reaching the gear shift is awkward The leather seats are quite comfortable - maybe not for larger indivduals due to the curving in of the seats.  ","Bluetooth, quiet interior, music box.",Would like to be able to override the nav system to be able for passenger to operate while driving wind deflector for moonroof tinted windows to keep out the heat more leg room in the back seat better design of cup holders (to be able to hold more than one cup).
4.875,Please don't say we're there yet...,Ed ,03/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After 3K miles and 3 months of varied driving conditions, the EX is as fun as legal fun gets.  I keep looking for that one extra button that will initiate blast off to that groovy space station on 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It would fit right in.  And isn't that what a car's ultimate goal is - putting you in a special place outside the drudgery of life?  No, it's not for a family of four.  I don't ride in the backseat, so that means nothing to me. The designers got it right.  To lengthen it for rear leg room would ruin the lines of the car. So, its not the best car for the family, but when the last kid goes, this rocket should be on your short-list. Up front it's all good.","Those first moments of entering - what else can you call it - ""the cockpit"", pushing the button and starting to smile as it comes to life.  Time to drive!  The nav system is the best yet.  I will never own another car without a rear camera. The self-healing paint.",Why detune it and remove 12 HP?  Spread mounts for crossbars further apart for more stability for loads if you want to do that.
4.875,Happy with my EX  AWD,AB in MA ,03/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Went in looking for the G35 but when I saw the EX I loved it! Then I test drove and had to buy it. It's just the perfect size for me. Not too big of an SUV, it's really a Crossover but I did not need or want anything bigger. I'm single and rarely have rear passengers so this was a perfect fit for me. It's very luxurious yet sporty.  The build quality is excellent, top notch. Too soon to tell the gas mileage. I've only had it for 1 month and not even at 1000 miles break-in. I'm getting about 20mpg city.  ",I got the EX loaded with every option available. Love all the tech features. The AVM camera is very cool. My favorite is the voice recognition for the nav or telephone. ,"1) A 6sp manual transmission like the G35.  2) Automatic rear hatch release. I can't believe that for a $45k car, it has a manual hatch release. I can only open the rear from the rear gate. :("
4.875,Best yet,michelle  ,03/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I am a 3rd time Infiniti buyer.  Traded in FX for EX and love this car!! I got just about everything on it but the Tech package. I have only had it for about 3 weeks, gas mileage is good (23 mpg/freeway) and love the sound system. Still figuring out all of the extras.  I did knowingly downsize - the back seats and back are much smaller than the EX and would not be comfortable for adults to sit in back seats for long drives.  Remains to be seen if I regret the smaller size.  Also, trim around wheel well needs a small adjustment as it was not installed perfectly.  Trim quality gets better every year... wood trim is nice!",Nav/music system/headlights/keyless entry/comfortable seats.  It's got style!,None yet.
4.75,This vehicle is impressive,Randy ,03/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I've had the car for exactly one week - 400 miles.  So far I have nothing but praise.   I was looking for a G37 Coupe but just couldn't get comfortable in the heavy bolstered seats. Sales person suggested I try an EX. After a few test drives I was totally sold on the car. Bought one on the spot. It is luxurious, powerful, quiet, handles really well, comfortable and the build quality is first rate. The Bose stereo is awesome. I chose not to buy the high tech pkg but everything else is there. I love the rear view camera - what a pleasant surprise that has turned out to be. ",Excellent nav system. Superb stereo. Tight turning radius. Sports sedan-like handling. Almost SUV-level seating height. Super quiet interior.  Powerful and responsive motor. ,The primary gauges are surrounded by a bright neon blue light. Looks high tech but it's distracting. This vehicle should run on something other than premium fuel and mileage isn't particularly good either. The curtain bar in the back should be easily removed for large parcel storage. 
4.875,A Definite 10 ,Manny ,02/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"If you are an SUV owner and are thinking of buying this vehicle, you will have to reconsider the definition. Yes, it is a higher off the ground and yes, it has room in the back, but no this car will be more at home at the symphony than in woods. I bought mine a few weeks back -- it's the sweetest, most luxurious ride I've ever had. It's beyond comfortable, techonologically an Einstein and it handles like butta! It is incredibly user friendly and at first I thought it might be too elegant for me, but I got over that quickly. The back seat is not the largest, but it is comfortable. The prem. and nav. package were well worth it. City gas = 18.5 mpg which ain't bad. Great job Infiniti!","The great drive and ride, the awesome design and the primo navigation and sound systems.",The back seat could be a bit roomier.
4.125,Infiniti EX Journey AWD,writernd ,02/06/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,4,5,2,4,"Had had about four Saabs previously and was going to get a Saab convertible, when it was suggested that I try the new EX.  I thought it would be too big (I don't like SUVs).  When I saw it, I knew instantly, it was a car I would like, and would buy instead of lease.",Music Box (which records CDs into a built-in hard drive -- the Premium package).,"The cup holder does not fit two tall coffees; the coffee covers hit and knock one off kilter.  The Music Box should record from an iPod of Compact Disc as well as the CDs, which it does not.  Would be nice if the key could be charged when inserted into the key holder.  "
4.875,Gadget Freak's Delight,Larry ,02/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is simply amazing. It's got pretty much any possible gadget you could think of (with the exception of maybe rain-sensing wipers). The around-view camera makes parking in tight spots a breeze, and the acceleration is breath taking. I did a lot of research and test drives of competitors and this one is simply the best. Lexus and BMW can't come close on the gadget end, and if you don't need all the cargo room for an SUV but want to occassionally have the rear seats folded for longer objects, this is the perfect crossover. The rear leg room is definitely tight (and you may need to even push up the front seats a bit to get the back seats down) but I rarely have passengers anyway.","Nav, power rear seats, intelligent key, around-view camera.","Rear leg room, don't lockout nav (or at least allow an override) when driving, XM radio should show station list, not just current station."
5,Love it,Theresa ,02/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I went from a Navigator to the EX35. I love the handling and the ride is exceptional. The interior is beautful with roomy front driver/passenger area. Yes, the back seats  seem short on space but my 6'1"" husband said he was very comfortable on a recent trip. ","the gadgets; nav, voice recog., cameras, keyless entry, bluetooth...",a few inches added to the back seat leg room
4.5,Fits the bill,Iamluvinit ,01/23/2008,,,5,4,5,4,,5,4,4,5,"I was quite torn between the G35 sedan and the EX and I am more than happy with my decision to buy the EX. Since '03 I have driven a G35 (03), then moved to a big SUV the Nisaan Armada (04) and now the EX (4 days) all equipped with the premium and navigation packages.  Then is by far the best of the three. I love the ride comfort and quite nature of the cabin when taking it easy and, when pushed, it responds like a sport machine. The engine is quite thirsty but, consistent with pretty much all variations of this powerplant. Not much space (think large coupe). The touch screen nav is easy and fun to use. Would highly recommend for those that can live with the space limitations.  ","Nav, HDD, stereo ""Driver Stage"", keyless entry.",One touch for all windows puddle lite on passager sided seat extenders 
5,Absolutely Love It!!!!,jnolen ,01/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife needed a new vehicle, and coming from a Nissan Xterra, she wanted a much smoother ride.  So, onto the crossovers we looked. No vehicle had an edge there.  It came down to comfort, space, and well, gadgets. Yes, the EX has the smallest room of all, but for us, perfect room, and had every feature we wanted-something no other had.  6'2"" passenger had no problems sitting in the backseat. The cruise system is a must!!","Where to start - the LDW/LDP are lifesavers. the adaptive headlights make a HUGE difference on dark, winding streets, the nav & voice recognition work extremely well, and the Birdseye view camera ensures we won't scrape anything in those cramped parking lots!  Seats are most comfortable ever been in.",Only thing - slightly larger cupholders
5,Best vehicle I've owned!,Jerry ,01/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"If you are considering a ""crossover"", you cannot leave this one off your list. After looking for about a month I went to Infiniti and from the first minute of the test drive I knew I had to buy!","All around camera, Bose stereo, engine, and the looks!",Everything is perfect except it needs to run on regular gas! 
4.75,Couldn't ask for more!,Laurie ,01/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"We traded a small, feel all the bumps, 2002 Audi TT for this dreamy car. As an older couple who enjoys/expects comfort and reliability from a car, the Infiniti EX35 is perfect for us. Luxurious inside, sturdy looking outside, lots of get up and go, and tons of ""toys"". We love cars, have had many, including BMW and Lexus, and this Infiniti is at the top of the list!","The navigation birds eye view is terrific, and the real time traffic is a plus (but after three months it goes away unless subscribed to.) Our wheat interior is beautiful, the seats comfy and stylish.  Smooth drive and quick acceleration too! The dark current color is a nice change.","The gas mileage was almost a deal breaker. Additionally, if the backseat is in the up position, there isn't much cargo room."
3.875,2008 Infiniti EX35,PL ,01/06/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,3,4,Wanted a sports car but needed more function.  I found the EX almost as fun to drive as the G37 with a much smoother ride & a semi-useful back seat.  Much more refined than Acura RDX & considerably less expensive than BMW X3. ,"Lots more toys than my Toyota 4Runner so I'm probably not a good judge.  Intelligent cruise, iPod interface, phone interface, push button start & whole lot more.",More back seat leg room.
4.75,I love this vehicle,Bizzybritt ,01/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"THIS CAR IS A DREAM COME TRUE!! I must say I have read some reviews by people who were let down by the EX and its rear space.  I guess I am not as picky since I had a mini cooper S before this vehicle.  I wanted something a little bigger, with a touch of sport with a luxury feel.  The car is very stylish and clean.  I would pass up a BMW, or Mercedes anyday for an Infiniti.  I think the price is very compariable to several vehicles out there that offer the same features.  I may be biased since I have always been a fan of Infiniti.  I love this vehicle.  ",The interior design and color schemes. Tight turn radius.  Comfortable interior.  ,Power lift tail gate. Xenon tail lights should be standard.  Better gas mileage.
4.875,The car I've been looking for!!,Jordan O ,12/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just traded my 2006 S2000 for a fully loaded EX35 and I have no regrets.  This vehicle is perfect! The outside looks like a FX35/45 and G37's offspring and the interior is nothing short of luxury. If you are looking for a vehicle that can take your friends anywhere in style quickly and safely, get one of these!",The technology and sport packages. The leather dash is beautiful. The engine and brakes are fantastic as well.,"Gas mileage is acceptable for a large, powerful vehicle but I wish it took mid- grade or regular instead of premium. Other then that there is nothing to fault."
