I bought it at premium price from a Lexus dealer.  After two years and 28,000 miles no problems.  All scheduled maintenance was performed.  Replace front bumper  2 or 3 times, but that is because of pilot errors.  I am a loyal  Lexus owner.  My previous car was a '98 LS400 with 390,000 miles it and spent 4,000 dollars on my third 90,000 mile checkup.  It was time for a change.   I gave this car to my niece and bought this newer car and expect 250,000 more miles of satisfaction.",,

Took the car to the lexus dearership where they kept it for four days and could not solve the problem. I have tan interior and allthough it's beautiful to look at it is hard to keep clean my drivers side door shows a lot of wear.

Great car till it comes to front suspension issue, its a money pit. I have had my fair share of BMW ownership as well; however, my Lexus tops BMW in repair bills. I have put over $5K just in suspension work and no this car has never been in any accident. What happened to the legendary reliability? I guess it is only legend with this car, even dealership acknowledges the inherent issue. Shame on you Lexus for charging premium price for this junk as well as premium price for parts.Update: Dealer recommended to replace brake activator assembly for $3,706.91 for making noise,, they always refused to fix it when the car was under warranty because it was character of LS460 and didn't cause any danger to its occupants. Interior of the car has started to melt in Houston TX heat. Just Google yourself ""Melting Toyotas"". Lexus has refused to fix 2008 and onward,,, they are only doing recall on 2007 LS460. The most disappointing car I have ever purchased. Lexus LS460 sales has dropped 2007 - 35,226 to 2015 - 7,165 (US sales).... Keep making cheap cars Lexus.....",,

We also have an 02 LS430 with 112 on it and the only thing that broke was the driver window regulator.  Way way more reliable than the 7 BMW and one MB S class we have previously owned.     The car is super quiet and gets great mileage on the highway.   The Mark Levinson in my 08 is much better than the ML sound in the 02.  The stereo is absolutely fantastic!  The other thing I like is it has a chain driven timing belt so no more expense of replacing the timing belt in the previous generation.  I highly recommend this car.,,

This is our 4th Lexus and I am disappointed in the overall quality of the car.  Aside from the recall, I have had a number of mostly minor quality- related issues since my last review, including an issue with paint chips on the front of the car and a blown out speaker in my expensive Levinson stereo.  If I had to do it over again knowing what I know now, I would not purchase this car.  I expected uncompromising quality in a car I could drive for 10 years like my last 2 (less expense) Lexus vehicles.  Now I worry about expensive repairs down the road.  I am thinking seriously about getting rid of the car.",Comfortable car with incredible fuel economy for a V-8 (on highway; terrible fuel economy around town).  Bluetooth works great.  It is difficult to point out too many highlights when you bought a car for it's quality reputation and then find yourself disappointed in the car's quality.,Overall quality is clearly not the same as previous Lexus vehicles; Navigation needs to do a better job of phone number and address look up - it is quicker to print out something from MapQuest before leaving; voice commands mostly useless - quicker to push buttons

I tried to find a more economical replacement but there are none on the market.  The German cars that are in the same league are unreliable and even more overpriced than this one, and because I keep my cars forever they're not an option for me.  If I leased it wouldn't matter, outside of how much time you care to waste in a car dealership. ","Ride, power, silence, luxury, Levinson stereo, simple controls, no mouse type control.

5,Truly amazing car!,LSfan ,09/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,My wife and I originally went into the Lexus dealer looking for a new GS.  The salesman took us for a ride but said upfront that the car may be a little small for me.  I am 6'5 and broad shouldered.  He was right and the car was a bit cramped.  While we were waiting for him to return with the keys my wife saw the LS460 and said she loved how that one looked.  I of course responded that it was also the most expensive!  When our salesman returned we said we would also like to drive the LS.  Of course there was no comparison and we bought the LS.  It is just the perfect car.  So fast and incredibly comfortable.  The interior is the nicest we have ever seen baring none.  Highly recommend it!,"The high horsepower engine is amazing, blue tooth and hard drive are great.

However, like  with most other owners, the side wind noise drives me batty.  And calls to Lexus say that it is a design problem, that nothing can be done about it, and the problem won't be addressed until about the 2011 model year.  Bummer.  Also, the complete lockout of nearly every navigation feature while in motion renders the system nearly useless.  Don't waste the money on this.

My major complaint is the difficulty of modifying the navigation system while the auto is in motion.  I understand the safety ramifications, but when you have a passenger in the front seat this should be disarmed.   I was pleasantly surprised with the gas mileage...I've actually hit 33 miles per gallon with this car, which to me is unheard of with this large of an engine (and considering how fast I drive).  The navigation system is not logical.  The Acura RL I recently traded in was very intuitive, this one, the driver actually has to arrange his thoughts before hitting the ""talk"" switch.",Retracting mirrors when the car is locked.,"Allow the navigation system to operate while the car is in motion.

The performance is very good for a large sedan, not as good as the 750, but pretty close.

The two things that absolutely stand out are the following: interior styling and fit and finish, and the smoothness/quietness of the ride at any speed. Clearly Lexus is well known for both of these attributes but on a daily basis they continue to impress. I shopped the 7, S550, A8 and all of them are very fine cars but none of them though outdo the LS is the aforementioned categories. AND - the LS is 20k less than all three of those models. Bottom line : An extremely fine vehicle in every sense that tries not to scream ""I am rich"".","Interior, smooth acceleration, Mark Levinson audio, navigation, styling.","I added the ""touring"" wheels to my short wheelbase at extra cost.

Although a big car the fuel economy is very good. On my regular highway journeys I get 28-29 mpg. Average mixed around town and highway this only drops to about 24mpg. The park assist steering is too complicated to set up and responds too slowly for it to be useful, but it is a fun feature. This is truly a luxury car which is quiet and a pleasure to ride in. The extra rear legroom is always appreciated when I carry passengers.","Everything is well thought out for driver comfort, but especially the rear view camera, parking hold, navigation system, vented seats and Lexus Link. The sunroof wind deflector protrudes just a little too far and causes wind roar. If it is lowered one eight inch, with your finger, it is much quieter.",Adaptive cruise control would be nice - my wife's Avalon has this so why not the Lexus.

Its power is impressive as well as its 8 speed transmission which is seamlessly smooth. One minor drawback is the roughness of downshifting at 30 mph.

The LS is unbelievably quiet even at all speeds & in the city. Even driving at 50 MPH with the sun roof open is quieter than most vehicle with a closed sunroof. The interior is impeccable and is likely nicer than many living rooms you will encounter.

5,Best car I have driven to date,M.C. ,12/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I had an '01 E430 for the past 5 1/2 years and decided to move away from German cars in general, mostly because how often it needed to be seen by a mechanic (and it is never a cheap visit).  Ironically enough, I orginally went to look at the GS first but it took only 1 test drive for me to know the LS was it for me.  I looked at pretty much all of the other cars out there, but this was the best deal for the money.  Keep in mind, that this car competets with the S Class and 7 Series BMW, but is much cheaper.  All of my friends love this car and I get so many complements on its beauty.  You are not doing yourself justice if you have the money to spend and don't test drive this one.",Seriously fast car.  Gets almost 30 mpg on the highway when you throw it in 8th gear.  The amount of leg room in the back seat is amazing  My girlfriend has back problems and loves the plush leather seats (she hated the Benz).  Gigantic trunk.  I swear the car floats when you drive it.  Incredible.,"There is some wind noise for sure.  Having to stop to use the navigation system is also a pain in the butt, but I am not to sure that I want everyone driving 70 mph on the highway while punching keys into the dash at the same time.  If only it could be used while someone was in the passenger seat."
5,What a Great Ride!,Christian ,12/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After having driven a Mercedes E-Class for the last seven years, I fell in love with this Lexus.  I had initially planned on purchasing the GS model, but felt that it did not have enough headroom for me.  After testdriving the LS, I knew that it was the perfect car for me!  With the exception of the two suggested improvements noted, I love everything about this Lexus.  It seems that Lexus considered even the most minute details when they designed this car, in order to create a ride as close to perfect as possible!","Smart key, Bluetooth technology, automatic parking brake mode, heated seats & steering wheel, Mark Levinson sound system, and the intuitive parking assist.","The Voice Command System needs to be improved.  Often, this system does not understand me correctly.  Lexus should include a list of all available voice commands in their manual.  Also, Lexus should be able to figure out a way to keep the backup camera clearer in rainy weather (a wiper or blower?)."
4.625,Transmission noise,ted ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,Previously owned a LS 430. LS 460 similar with improvements. Great audio system and ride but not sports car like in quality.,Audio and navigation system,Car has noticeable clunk as if downshifting when accelerating from a stop. Dealer says nothing wrong. When you try a Lexus you should see if this is present in that car as well since it will drive you mad. Is this a $70000 car feature? 
4.75,Magic Carpet Ride....Yes,Tom ,12/11/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is my 5th Lexus 400 series. The 08 is far and away the best of the best. Very smoothe ride like all my Lexus' have been.  But, this one is the most quiet of them all.  ",I have everything except the Advanced Parking.  I know how to park so I couldn't justify the additional expense. The stereo system is a major upgrade from my 430. The nav system is also improved but I've had to read the manual so I know the commands and how to pronounce them. Incredible ride!!,I love the car. I like the size of the 430 front seats better.  The 460 is certainly comfortable and the seats wide enough but the 430 has longer seats that fit perfectly at the break in my knees. This one hits above my knees and is nice but not as comfortable. 
4.875,Magic Carpet Ride,Tom Kinder ,12/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Extreme comfort, reliability, and a smart layout internally. Reasonably quiet ride.  Lexus separates you from the road so expect a different feel if you're previously a BMW or Audi owner.  Gas mileage is better than I expected but it's not about fuel efficiency if you buy a 460, it's about the ride.  I call it a ""magic carpet ride"". I am very pleased.",Navigation system is easy to use. The parking sensors are excellent. Levinson sound system is tops.,
4.75,The Best,Ferdi ,11/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Waited for 2008 model because of the wind noise, grabby brakes I read for 2007, but I have this car for a month now and I don't see any of these complaints. The LS 460 is smoother, slightly quieter and faster than my 2001 LS 430, although there is a little engine noise on low speed which I think is the current design. The brakes are as good or better than my LS 430. The rear seat leg room is more than enough. I don't see this small footrest complaint for 07, this car is simply the best.",Mark Levinson/ navigation. Interior design/comfort. Electronic park brake/ brake hold. Power trunk and door closer.,Surprisingly no memory seat for front passenger. XM satellite reception not as clear as the FM stereo. 
4.5,"Nice car, but just an expensive Toyota!",M.H. ,10/28/2007,,,5,4,3,5,,5,5,5,4,"Just traded from years of driving BMWs and Mercedes for my first Lexus, the LS 460 with all the options except laser cruise.  It is a nice car with great creature comfort features, but is it really worth the price tag compared to the build quality of german sedans (the jury is still out with me!!)?  There is a lot of wind noise that should not be in a car of this price!  It handles surprisingly well for a large sedan and gets great gas mileage for such a powerful engine!  ","Smart key, nav system, wonderful Mark Levinson surround sound system! Perfect paint job! Silky smooth V8 and 8 speed tranny! Reliability is supposed to be bullet proof compared to european models.  Great dealer service!","Get rid of the wind noise!!  Tweak brakes to not be so grabby.  Improve fit and finish inside and outside (too many loose fitting items).  Improve the voice command system.  Try to separate the car a little more from its Toyota counterparts, meaning a luxury flagship should be just that!"
2.875,Luxury without quality,econpasha ,10/27/2007,,,5,4,1,1,,2,5,3,2,"After reading about the quality issues of the BMW 750 and Mercedes sedans, I bought the Lexus 460.  Lexus 460 developed engine trouble after the first 100 miles or so.  The car started shaking badly, even at idle. After phoning the dealer, we limped home.  Tonight, the dealer picked up the car with a flat-bed truck and took it away.",It is comfortable.  Extremely quiet.  Voice command looks promising. Comfortable rear seats.  Glove box lid feels cheap. Who needs ash trays anymore?  Doors close very nicely.  Back up camera was almost useless in the rain we had to drive through.  Got fogged up badly.,"No feel for the road.  My friend in the passenger seat could not use the nav system while we were driving.  We had to stop.  My $300 Garmin works better.  The car should have been checked out much better by the dealer. Hated to see a $70,000+ car loaded unto a truck and driven away on its first day."
4.875,Great car - lousy navigation system,Ken in Missouri ,10/08/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Luxurious car.  Great ride, quiet as a tomb and comfortable.  Fit and finish is great, just don't roll down the rear windows at highway speeds.  The noise and interior vibrations will beat you to death. The sound system and power door locking system is fantastic.  The navigation system cannot be added to or changed while you are moving - very poor ""feature"". My wife has an Acura with a much better nav system. ","The Levenson audio system is fantastic. The quiet, comfortable interior is well designed and good looking.","The navigation is all but useless, unless you want to pull off the road and program it.  The system is only available by precise voice commands when you are moving.  Good luck in you have a lisp, accent, stutter or there is wind noise or anyone else speaking while you shout your instructions."
5,Magic car - Perfect 10 - LS 460,mitchell rowe ,10/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The 2008 SWB LS 460 is light years ahead of the 2007,","Extreme quiet, power, vision, brakes, intelligence, satellite radio, fit and finish.",None.
