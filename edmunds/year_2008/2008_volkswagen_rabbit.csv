5,After 131K Miles Still No Major Problems,Kevin Lee ,08/16/2016,,,,,,,,4,,,,This car is not an economy car but very versatile.  Fun to drive.  Decent horse power.  Very reliable (no major repairs needed after 131K miles besides normal wear and tears).,,
3,VW Golf after eight years & 110K,Craig m ,07/27/2016,28.3,3,3,,,4,5,4,2,,,"This body style is now called the Golf, but a decade ago it was called a Rabbit.  I liked the car, and it put up with a lot of careless use.  I use my cars for short hops, pickup truck-like hauling, and 2000 mile cross-country trips.  I do NOT baby them, and the Rabbit took it all like a champ.  Buyers should be cautious to make sure they are happy with the fit of the driver's seat with respect to the controls, because I experienced a tendency to find myself feeling off-center on long trips.  That is, I didn't feel I was sitting directly in line with the middle of the steering wheel.  I think that was because of a combination of leg length and the rather tight console tunnel placement.  This is designed as an inexpensive VW, so don't expect the best of anything - but I am sure that today's Golf offers some improvements over the rudimentary radio/CD player the Rabbit came with.  The big attraction back then was the Electronic Stability package, which VW was the first to offer at this price point - and that worked great!  If you are a believer in dealer servicing, be prepared for high routine maintenance costs, and be aware you cannot even change the air filter on this car yourself.  My particular car had a few gremlins in it:  the cruise control would sometimes not come on unless I re-booted the car...and I was never sure whether my interval wipers were stopping because the German engineers wanted them to, or because a gremlin wanted them to.  (It didn't make much sense to me that I didn't need a clear windshield if I was stopped at a traffic light, but they quit working nonetheless.)  I considered these all to be minor annoyances, though.  The plastic frame that supports the radiators, headlights and sheet metal at the front end of the car can be broken in very minor collisions or road debris encounters.  That's an expensive fix, and constitutes a real design flaw.  But I suppose other cars of this type have similar drawbacks.  The hatchback would admit an insane amount of cargo, and the car handled great in deep snow as well as deep water and misty-slick pavement.  No engine issues at all.  Tranny required work after 105K of hard use.",,
5,Excellent Car,brian1121 ,02/12/2014,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought this car brand new when I was 16, for just under $16,000 and haven't looked back since. It's pushing 7 years and over 100,000 miles now and no problems at all. Changing the oil every 10k miles and changing brakes as needed I'm sure helped the quality remain top-notch. Quick enough for getting around town along with decent fuel economy, however I wish the mpg were a little better.","Interior is really top-notch for the price. Compared to Honda, Toyota, even Subaru, the interior is WAY nicer and seems like a notch or two above the competition. The 177lbs of torque are nice too, you can really feel it in the upper rpms. Lots of room in the back seat, too. I'm 6'1 and fit in the back seats comfortably. However, I do recommend the 4 door over the 2. Clutch is really nice too, without feeling overly assisted like the Golf 6 does.","Fuel economy. The new Tiguans are getting 32 on the highway and my rabbit is pushing 30 if I've got the wind at my back. Not a dealbreaker, but it definitely could be better."
3.875,No More VWs,real_kadini ,01/23/2014,,,4,4,5,1,,5,4,3,5,"This 2008 Rabbit is the 2nd Golf/Rabbit in the family since 2003. The 1st was a 1999 Golf which nickeled and dimed us to death, mostly with lightbulbs, but also other sometimes unbelievable electrical failures. The reliability ratings on the 2006 and up VWs were vastly improved over the previous years, so I took a chance and bought this one in 2010, certified, from a VW dealer with 50K miles, as a graduation gift to my daughter. She couldn't afford to operate it so I bought it back from her with 59K miles thinking it would be a good work car for 3-4 years. WRONG! (continued below)","Although spared most of the electrical gremlins (the right year passenger window wouldn't go back up from the driver console, and the intermittent wipers had a mind of their own) the transmission developed a penchant for clunking, and worse, getting stuck in 5th gear, sometimes when you were trying to merge into traffic from a stop. VW could, of course, find nothing wrong and wouldn't replace the valve body (which had a service bulletin and warranty extension on it) without a fault code, in spite of there being a lot of anecdotal information that this may have fixed the problem. (continued below)
","The car is really a wonderful vehicle. Fun to drive and very practical, but not worth dying for. Reliability continues to be a MAJOR issue for VW. I will never buy another VW and will ceaselessly and tirelessly discourage others from buying them. I took a huge bath on this car financially.

Suggested Improvements:
Make cars that aren't pieces of crap."

The car starts without hesitation, stops on a dime, and has great pick up. VW offers a fairly comprehensive warranty and tends to repair certain items out of ""goodwill"" even when out of warranty. I never take my car to the dealer(unless it a recall) and have learned how to do every maintenance or repair on my own through the various forums that VW enthusiast keep up to date. This has helped keep my costs down while being able to own a safe German designed foreign car. For those without the ability to work on their own VW I would recommend checking out the prices for services in your local area.","There are many but I would have to say my top 3 are the ability to hook up the car to my laptop to see whats wrong with it, windows that do not pinch your fingers (senses your hand in its way), the auxiliary input, gas mileage on the highways is usually around 28-30 mpg, safety (I crashed into the back of a stationary f 150 at 35 mph and walked away), easy to control bass, treble, and mids with knobs that are clearly in view and labeled and best of all there is cup holders all around (ive counted 6 in my head here)","My only gripe about the car is that my headliner could not take the Miami heat and after 4 years has begun to sag in 2 spots. Although the total area sagging is less than the size of a dinner plate combined, its in my peripheral vision and so it bothers me. "

Now at 122 k with no repairs. Tires, oil, filters i.e. maintenance only. A couple of bulbs changed. That's all. Used to drive VW Passats, earlier with no major problems.  The single issue is Check engine light which is turning on and off by itself.  If you want a good VW buy one built in Germany.","Handling, gas consumption, power.

I actually traded down from a 2009 GTI with DSG to my VW Rabbit with the standard automatic and I actually prefer the drive of the Rabbit than I did to the GTI.  Power delivery is obviously less but not a huge difference as it has 170bhp which has plenty up and go for me.  The car is very versatile, comfortable on long journey's, love the 60/40 split rear seats to give HUGE cargo space for such a little car, 4 door's makes it a good family car with kids and cheap enough to buy out right so I have no car payments :-) I love it!!!

4.875,Best purchase,Christina ,08/18/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,This is my third car and by far my favorite. I enjoy everything about this car. You can still fit 5 adults in the car even though from the outside wouldn't think so. I haven't had any issues with the car at all. I take it to the dealership and Im treated like a princess every time I go there for whatever reason it is. Volkswagen overall has impressed with me with their product and service.,The sportiness of it but yet it is still a practical car. Great for road trips. I have driven to Pittsburgh from NJ several times and it was a super easy ride in the rabbit.,"Definitely a different texture is needed for the panels of the doors. It gets scuffed up very easily. Also, the fabric used is not easily cleaned. (IE, I have a dog that has very fine hair and when I take it to the car wash the guys cant get the hair out of the seats when it is vacuumed.)"
5,I couldn't ask for a better first car.,jdamato ,06/22/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My Rabbit is my first car and it's a fantastic car. My brother drove it for a year and then handed it down to me for a Jeep. It's really everything I wanted in a car. A good design, amazing handling and performance and very good gas mileage(just what I need for a job that's 22 miles away from my house).  I haven't had any major problems yet. The only problem I had was my emergency brake wasn't disengaging all the way and it wore my back brakes really fast. ",I love the 5-speed feel of when you shift and you get that nice little jolt back. My brother's old BMW was a 5-speed and never had that kick of when you shift.,The car is relatively quiet because it has 2-3 mufflers. There should be a 6th gear too because highway driving at 3500 rpm drastically reduces the gas mileage for 35 mpg to about 20-25 mpg.
4.75,I knew I made the right choice.,Steve Rego ,06/02/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Well, I haven't owned it for too long, but I sure bought it for a reason. I wanted a car that was a good combination of looks, quality, performance, practicality, and comfort. This car executes all of these criterion very well.  I was concerned with its fuel economy but I read on ways to increase my fuel economy (cruising in the highest gear possible, and being light on the gas, with the exception of my starts, driving 60 on the highway with cruise control enabled), I have been getting 28-30 in the city and about 35 on the highway at 60 mph. I've been getting a combined 32 mpg... good for 464 miles on a tank. It can get good economy if you want it too. ","Adjustable Cruise Control, Side Turn Signals, Fuel Economy Gauge on Instrument Panel, comfortable upright driving position.","Engine isn't the best engine. They need to get a direct injection 4 cylinder, like a 1.8 liter, get 170 horses out of it with good fuel economy, requiring only regular gas. This way a regular driving technique can manage a combined high 20, low 30s fuel economy.  Center Armrest should be there."

I still get excited getting into the car even 2 years later. This was my first german car after owning pontiacs, chevy (mini van), mercury (villager), honda (prelude and fit), Nissan Sentra, Geo Prizm, Daewoo Nubira and Mazda Protege.  Honestly this little rabbit is a whole notch above any of my previous cars.  It is so solid, buttoned down and feature rich that nothing else comes close for the price.

The Rabbit offers a GREAT value when compared to it's competitors. Where else do you get 170hp, a slick interior, climate control, power everything, alarm, etc, starting at $16K!? The answer is nowhere. It's no wonder the Rabbit, and it's high performance brother the GTI win nearly every compact car comparison. People who complain about the gas mileage are comparing it to 4 cyl cars making 100-130hp and very little torque. This is a 5 cyl making 170 hp and 177 ft/lbs.

The 6 speed tiptronic transmission is a lot of fun and very unexpected in such a low price car.  The interior and build quality constantly amaze me after having Fords, Pontiacs, Chevys.  The 2.5 engine doesn't mind being revved, and sounds pretty good when doing it.  Although, it is a fairly thirsty little car, as I average 17 in city driving.

It feels like a budget BMW with comfortable seats, an excellent driving position, and a wonderful 6spd automatic.

He doesn't mind that the rear windows don't open. Still, with the back seat up, the car has plenty of room for the grandkids. My only complaint is, having found the ideal seat/steering wheel combo, I can't seem to adjust the seatbelt away from my neck.","Height adjustable driver's seat and telescoping steering wheel (both hard to find in this price range), supportive front seats, powerful 2.5 five-banger, ipod connection hidden in armrest, multi-function trip computer, generous interior room.","Coupe needs a light-color interior option (hey, it's over 100F here 5 months of the year); lower the center console to allow more right knee room between it and the steering column. And as a previous poster noted, the Golf sold in Europe uses storage space more cleverly, as does the Scion xD here."
5,Love my new Bunny,Redbox ,02/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just got my new bunny a week ago, I love it.  It got its baptism, not by fire, but 8 inches of snow.  My previous vehicle was an '00 Tracker, 4WD, and I was concerned about not having the 4WD. I was pleased with the traction control, having not driven FWD for years.  Very pleased with everything.  I currently have 242 miles on a little less than 3/4 of a tank gas.  I think the mileage will be fine. In summary, Farfegnugen!! I never thought I would own a VW.

4.875,Nimble and Fun!,Jiten ,02/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought my Shadow Blue 08 Rabbit 2 months ago and driven it 3200 miles.  I've already done a 1000 mile road trip and driven my kids to school regularly.  I look for reasons to hop in the Bunny and drive.  It's really fun to drive and scoots through trafic like a knife through butter.  I've driven Toyotas, Mazdas, Hondas and Nissans and while they've been decent cars, nothing comes close to the Rabbit in build quality, interior design, the plethora of features on a base model and best of all the sheer fun factor.","I LOVE the adjustable arm rest(great for long road trips),which can be extended forward and raised or lowered to fit just right.  The 6 disc stereo with MPP3 puts out awesome sound. The glove box cooling vent, the fold flat front passengers seat & additional cup holders in the doors are all great.",Could use more storage spaces (like the Golf equivalent in Europe has)- under seat storage and a small compartment on the dash to the left of the steering column.  In addition the mixed gas mileage could be better- I am getting 24mpg.  I got 27 hwy on the long road trip. Got 26/30 from my 99 Protege
4.75,Lots of praise and no regrets,J Hall ,02/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Originally I was looking for an upgrade to a small SUV but couldn't find anything with pep, decent MPG, and a sticker below $25000.  So on to the hatches!  $20-22k was more in the price range and the Rabbit perfectly fits the bill.  This thing has so much ROOM for a hatch.  It's amazing.  The only roomy complaint I have is that the drivers knees are *slightly* cramped.  There is plenty of length, but something feels a little too tight when it comes to the steering wheel and the knees.  But that's it!  That's about the only complaint.  The interior, exterior, ride, zip/power, handling, and features are way beyond the competition. 4door auto, ESP, sunroof, alloys, and 170HP for $20k. Nice.","Torque, smooth ride, style and design, stereo, good MPG for what you get (25mpg avg, 80% city), regular gas, rear seat space, solid feel when opening/closing doors and hatch, room for the dog in the back, and did I mention it's fast?","(Half-hearted complaints.) Option for steering wheel upgrade and leather seats, have tiptronic mode slide left, not right, better aux port placement, and need better availability of option loaded cars.  Have had for 3 months, reliability unknown at this point."

The 08 2dr Rabbit is perfect for me. I find the car suits all of my needs. It's perfect for getting to school and work in the Metro area (great for those small parking spots downtown).

4.75,What a bargain !,robert peter ,01/12/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I bought the car 5 days ago so I can't yet speak for the reliability and the quality. But so far its a great car to own. I bought the car stripped except for the alloy wheels. But stripped the car has just about all I need. The 8 speaker stereo is great. The car rides very comfortable, it hugs the road, and the 5 speed manual is about the smoothest I've ever driven! There is some road noise mainly from the 16"" tires as at a full stop in traffic the engine is very quiet. Also the AC/heat tends to get loud when cranked up but hey, the car cost $15K. My biggest problem is with the 2.5L engine is avoiding a ticket! ","2.5L engine, responsiveness, smooth ride, cost. MPG is not as bad as many suggested. Drove every day to work this week.

3.25,Not an economy car ,paul ,01/07/2008,,,3,3,4,3,,4,3,2,4,"The Rabbit is fun to drive and inexpensive to purchase. Handling is very good. Acceleration from the 170 horse 5 cylinder is vastly better than the approx 120 horsepower and 4 cylinders of most cars at this price point. Interior space is good compared to the small exterior. From its price and size you might think it is an economy car but it is not. Gas mileage is poor (pathetic 22 MPH after 4 tanks). Dependability ratings are not nearly as good as an Asian car either. If you think of it as an inexpensive sports car you will be happy, if you think of it as something in the class of a bullet proof Honda or Toyota you may be disappointed. Overall I am neither very happy or unhappy with it.",Fun to drive. Good handling. Good acceleration. Hatchback and fold down seats make good use of space. Plenty of leg and head room for full size man in small car. Inexpensive to purchase (16K) but does not feel cheap. Solid feel. ,"Needs an armrest. It does not come stock with one and there is no option to order it. The snug seats, great road feel and sportiness that make it fun to drive short distances leave you a little uncomfortable on long trips. Dependability ratings have been below average for VW.Overall good+bad=ok car."
5,Great little car,Mark ,01/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Searched for over 3 months to replace an aging Jeep.  I wanted a hatchback for its space and size.  We looked at the Fit, Versa, Mazda3, Mini, Caliber and numerous others.  The finish and quality of the Rabbit was the best.  The performance is outstanding, I love the turn radius and size.  With my old cherokee, I had a little extra space in my garage.  With the Rabbit, I have even more with the same responsiveness and HP as the old 4.0L inline 6 in the Jeep with significantly better gas mileage - it doubled.  The dealership I purchased it encouraged naming it, so we now call it Rascal! (after Elmer Fudd wascally wabbit)","Power, build quality, workmanship inside with materials, and the small things (e.g., padded glovebox, aux connector, sound dampening materials, vented disc brakes all around), finally, of course - the hatch and its space!","Even with the better gas mileage than my old vehicle, it is still around 26-27."
4.625,Honda/Toyata guy converted to VW,VW convert ,01/04/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I am 100% satisfied with my Rabbit. For me, the Rabbit was a perfect balance of economy and performance. I had considered a whole spectrum of vehicles- from a Toyota Yaris to a Mazda Mazda3 hatchback. The VW Rabbit sits somewhere in between those two models in terms of mpg and is competitive with the Mazda3's performance, though I might say the Mazda has better handling. One thing that the Rabbit, and German cars in general, have over any other car I was considering was it's awesome build quality. My Rabbit is a small car and is by no means a tank, but it feels as strong and tough as one. Hondas and Toyotas feel like tin cans compared to VW's. The Rabbit is also very zippy and fun to drive.","The turning radius on this car is tops! It really adds to the fun factor.  Digital display of tripometer, temperature, mpg estimator, and more is really neat and I like indigo and red illumination of the console.  iPod hookups are great.  5 cylinder engine - a unique compromise between L4s and V6s.",1. find a way to decrease vehicle weight without sacrificing build quality- Rabbit is almost 3000 lbs; this could improve mpg 2. use an all digital console instead of mixed digital/analog functions for more contemporary styling- at least incorporate the speedometer into the digital display

Found salvation in this bunny that captures the essence of German road feel big time; cost less than Mazda 3 sport comparable equipped where I live.    Yes, the engine is a bit noisy, and road noise is somewhat high, but what the heck.  This is supposed to be an economy car.  I never thought about VW because of the bad rep re: reliability.

The new 170HP engine makes a small, but noticeable increase in peppiness and allows the driver to have fun.  Though the suspension has received some criticism for being soft, I feel it is pretty close to replicating the feel of the Mini; it is better than any other car Ive driven in this class.  I was very close to purchasing a Mazda 3, but the build quality feels more substantial in the VW Rabbit.  While the Mazda is quoted for having the German feel, the VW is truly has the German feel all the way, from the steering to the engine tuning.",Steering feel. Solid build quality.

I hit 95 mph without even noticing.  Could be trouble but it's a smooth ride I haven't found a single thing to complain about yet. Only 23 mpg on first tank of gas though with lots of highway driving.  I think I'm just being heavy on the gas though.,I'm a big guy and when people hear I have a rabbit they sort of chuckle but I can't reach the pedals with the seat all the way back and I fit fine in the backseat.  ,Like I said nothing to complain about.

4.75,Excellent all around car,Zandzaver ,11/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I've had the car for almost a month now and have loved every minute of it.  The interior layout is simple, sophisticated, and functional.  It is deceptively large on the inside, and very comfortable.  The drive is much like an entry level sports car, smooth, quick, and tight.  Fuel economy could stand to be a bit better, but then again, you gotta pay to play.  Also, I've experienced better than advertised gas mileage on the highway in my car.",Great price for the standard features and the engine.  Excellent safety. Stereo is fantastic.

Coming from another German car, a BMW 325, I appreciate the solid build - it doesn't have that tinny feel that too many of the Japanese econoboxes have. The standard features, like the ABS, DSC, etc., make the price very competitive. As far as driving experience, I would have to honestly say, this car is about 90% of the fun of my BMW for about 60% of the price.","Crash test ratings. Power. Fit and finish. Interior layout. Standard safety features. I don't know why, but I love the fabric of the cloth seats.

The downside I found is that the manual gets fewer MPG then the automatic (must be because they want you to spend the extra $1075 for the auto) but the manual is a lot more fun.  The ride is very bumpy but I have come to expect that from smaller cars.  Other then that I highly recommend to any one this car.
