4,So far  a good value for me,Schooder ,01/28/2016,4,,4,,,4,4,5,4,,,"I bought this car used at a dealer.7/2015   I live at 7000' above sea level  and occasionally drive to 5400' (New Mexico) This is important to understand reference to performance. The 4 cylinder Turbo accelerates nicely at this altitude. It accelerates close to or better that my 2006 Toyota 4runner V8.  I wanted to change the shifter handle for esthetic  reasons and ended up damaging a small piece of plastic and ended up with a $1100  repair bill the replace the entire shifter module  which had to remove from the bottom of the vehicle. The makers obviously  was not intending this to be removed, so be careful if you want to change out the leather shift handle. I really like the way the windows operate. Typical German engineering,  all the windows  come up/down with one touch   instead of just the driver door. There is a full size spare tire. The cruise control works great, one button push is all that is needed. And accelerates good. I bought it at 76,000  and now has 86,000 miles(1/2016).  I think the ride could be smoother. I wonder if different tires would help. I think VW has always been a poor man's Audi. It doesn't feel as solid as or as smooth on the road as smooth as A4s I have owned.",,

I love to drive it as it is both comfortable and sporty. Great ride and I would buy it again in a heartbeat. Just get ready to put Premium Fuel in it. I have no problem doing that as it gets close to 600 miles per tank and averages 32 highway. The only flaw is with the Exterior Design. If you live where is snows, the taillights will get completely covered by snow as they are LED and don't heat up at all, as I recently discovered in a blizzard. That can be scary. I'll just have to move out of the snowbelt because this car is worth it.

5,Far better than the competition,vroom ,12/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My base model 2008 Passat is amazing.  The seat is comfortable for my bad back, and there's plenty headroom (I'm tall).   The car is reliable and a blast to drive:  precise, responsive, and quick, especially using the auto-manual mode.  For my $$, Passat is far superior to Accord, Camry, Altima, Fusion, Outback, Volvo, Mazda and yes, Malibu, all of which I've test driven or rented.  Edmunds is wrong about Passat not being price competitive with Japanese cars.  To get a comfortable seat & decent interior in an Accord requires an EX, which costs thousands more than the base Accord.  The (unadjustable) lumbar ""support"" in the base Accord felt like a brick in my back.  Ditto Camry.","Everything.

When you start to read about the many little things that you can customize, like setting certain memory functions for the key fob, this car is hard not to like.

My old car ran great and I have to admit that it was hard to let it go, but I soon got over that. I have had the new car for about a month now and I like everything about it. The 2.0T 200 hp four cylinder is unbelievably powerful for an I4 and a drastic improvement over the 150 hp 1.8T in my old car. The suspension and steering are perfect, I barely feel bumps when I go over them. The fuel economy is excellent as well. I get between 350 and 400 miles out of every 16 gallon tank of gas. This car is the perfect balance of high performance and efficiency. ","The steering wheel mounted paddle shifters are a nice touch, although I haven't had much opportunity to experiment with them yet. I also like the built in I-Pod jack and the steering wheel mounted audio controls. ","The only complaint I really have about this car is the fact that it requires premium gasoline.

5,4th Passat and the Best Yet,passatcrazy ,06/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"VW has always excelled at getting the details right.  Nothing feels cheap, unlike my prior Infiniti, and everything is thought out nicely.  You don't realize this at the dealership, or on the ride home, it comes to you with one thoughtful touch after another over time, ie. the chime to remind you to remove your key stops chiming after a minute since it realizes you must be doing something deliberate; you can turn on the radio without the key in.  Fuel economy out of the gate 28.5 mixed, although driving easy to break in.  Stop and go Boston traffic on a 25 mile commute and average 25.5.

As I noted with my Jetta, the basics that come with a VW far surpass most other vehicles. It is definitely worth the money.

If you have test drive it, you won't ask this question because 4cyl turbo with sport mode gear, you got sporty driving experience. On the other side, you got fuel economy with regular driving.

5,Great Car!,Mike ,03/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had this car just a little over a month and it's absolutely great!  With just over 2, 000 Miles, I'm averaging between 32 mpg and 34 mpg on the highway and about 29 mpg for mixed driving.  At highway speeds it drives/rides almost as well as my wife's Mercedes e350 (although you hear a little More road noise).  The car has plenty of power for passing and merging even at highway speeds.  Everything seems very tight and well fitted.  No interior rattles (at least yet). Stability and the feeling of the driver being in control are impressive.  Very Nice car!","iPod adapter, interior lighting, leather seating","Bluetooth, slightly longer seating surfaces in the front."
4.75,So much fun,Joe ,03/06/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,5,5,"I test drove a lot of vehicles, including Acura TL, Volvo 40, Infiniti G35 and the Lexus IS 250. When I prioritized fuel economy, seat comfort for all passengers (12 ways on both fronts, Lux Edition) and fun factor, I kept coming back to the Passat. I've taken it to Florida and back, averaging almost 34 mpg. I've had a couple little problems that the dealer fixed right away; the satellite radio was defective and the right rear door mechanism broke inside.  This has been a very enjoyable purchase, and I often find  reasons to go somewhere now. I have about 8000 miles on the vehicle now.","Engine... feels like no other 4 cyl. I've ever been behind. Also, the 12 way power seats on both driver and passenger side is a great addition. ","The only thing my wife would like different is an easier way to close the trunk. In the winter, you're going to end up with dirty gloves, because the suggested method of closing from the provided interior handle isn't convenient."
5,Dedicated Passat Fan,Barry Ryan ,03/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my third one.  I had a 2002 wagon in which I survived a broadside collision.  The car was totalled but I escaped without a scratch.  VW has an ad which depicts exactly what happened to me; at an intersection the other car ran a red light and I hit them broadside.  I saw my life flash before my eyes!  I replaced that one with a 2006 sedan.  Just today we picked up a new 2008 wagon for my wife.  For me, the Passat is the perfect car.  The quality, performance and aesthetics are unsurpassed.  In my opinion the Passat beats out far more expensive Euro competitors and puts Honda and Toyota to shame. I know I sound like I work for VW but I don't; I just love the product.","Thoughtful amenities abound; compass, outside temp, satelite radio, sunshades, auto liftgate all the rest.",Option for memory setting on the drivers seat.

4.875,A Wolf in Passat Clothing,Tex Murphy ,02/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The B6 model sports numerous improvements over the B5 models, most notably, an insane 280HP v6 that uses as much gas as the outgoing B5!  Now that's just obscene!  The electromechanical steering mechanism is perfectly ""weighed"" and is precise, secure and responsive.  The Acura had a more pronounced body lean, and the steering wasn't that good.   The interior is a good blend of luxury and German pragmatism.  The buttons are intuitive, and the console is not as cluttered as the Acura's.  The Passat won out over the Lexus 330 and Acura TL.  I thought my wife's B5 kicked, but this one blows it away in every aspect save for color.   ","Many useability luxury touches such as memory seats tied to FOB.  V6 delivers a LOT of power.  Nice soft leather seats, impeccable interior.  Excellent safety features such as directional HID headlamps, and turning lights.  GPS well integrated with MFD.

4.625,Best Wagon Compromise,Elijah Gregory ,02/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"Have had 2 Audi A4s with quattro, but just moved to an area with no dealer, and like to have them close at hand.  Also with the birth of our third child, the A4 became too small.  With the larger interior of the Passat, this was perfect.  Looked at the A6 wagon, 535 wagon, E class wagon, Volvo V70.  The first three were just too expensive right now and the volvo may show up for my wife in a few years.  For the price, the VW could not be beat.  I only wish it was at least RWD if not AWD.  The torque steer coming out of my office parking lot (rough traffic - have to gun it) has been rather harsh.  I certainly miss the sportier character of the 2 Audis.",Lighting is perfect.  Exterior and interior styling is very nice.  Wheels are beautiful.  Interior room is fine for our family of 5 (at least around town).,"Bluetooth (the buttons are there already!), AWD for the 2.0T (now I know what torque steer is!),  Doors feel a little skimpy when you close them, phone charger (cig lighter) should continue to charge when car is off,  need charger in the armrest."

We looked at the A6 Avant, BMW 535 and Volvo wagons.  Since we had to have an all-wheel drive and wanted a wagon, it left only a few choices.  While not as posh as the Audi or BMW the VW is a steal based on price and standard equipment on the VR6 4-Motion model.  If a badge for the neighbors to see isn't a priority this is the best valued german wagon out there and it is a blast to drive compared to its Japanese counter parts.  The back seat leg room is great - even comfortable for adults.  Cargo space is cavernous.  This car handles incrdibly well in the snow and ice even with the stock 18"" all season tires.

5,Ride on,Ride on ,01/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I drove multiple other cars in this segment.  Chose the Passat after driving Honda, Nissan, Dodge, Mercedes and Cadillac.  This car has similar or more features for thousands less.  Being a large person- 6'5, 230lbs- the interior amazes at its roominess.  I stayed away from the nav system (mixed reviews), and find the rest of the controls are very intuitive and easy.  Build quality rivals any of the others, Japan or European.  Mileage very adequate- averaging 25mpg since purchase.  A little road noise is noticed at speed, but nothing unmanagable, or unable to be overcome by the fantasic sound system.

It is fun to drive; excellent acceleration, well mannered at high speeds (over 100 mph), handles great, and gets excellent gas mileage. Averages 27-30 miles per gallon on my commute and gets 32 or better on the highway.  Interior is roomy, comfortable, instruments are well positioned, and there are many many upgrades.  It does use premium gas and synthetic oil.  So the maintenance costs are a little higher.  It's worth it because this vehicle is fun to drive. I thought this is a great alternative to a Honda, Toyota, Infiniti, BMW, or Volvo. This has been my favorite vehicle so far for the price.  ","Acceleration, handling, tiptronic 6 speed trans, 18"" rims, leather memory seats, heated seats heat quickly, dual climate a/c, dyno audio/satellite/6 disc cd/iPod connector radio, auto hold feature, cool interior red LED lighting and one of my favorite features is the adj. armrest.",Slight hesitation when accelerating (turbo lag).

4.875,Excellent and Fun Family Sedan,ST ,01/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"The car handles very well for a large sedan. The 2.0 Turbo is suprisingly spirited, especially if you like to play with a manual transmission. Fuel economy is not sacrificed, I've been able to average 31-32 MPG over the daily 164 mile commute. Stopping power and cornering are very good, some road noise makes it into the cabin, but not nearly enough to be bothersome. Feedback through the suspension is good enough that road conditions are evident, but the ride is quite comfortable.","The best features are the large back seats, at nearly 6' I can put the drivers seat in a comfortable, relaxed position and still have room to stretch out in the back.  The MP3 format CD player allows over 150 tracks per CD, and the sound system is excellent.","The large chrome grill is a bit much for me personally, something a bit more understated would fit this sporty, but sensible sedan a little more.

I was a little cautious getting into a big sedan from a coupe,  but this car has power, comfort, performance and a gorgeous look. I have it fully loaded and wouldn't have it any other way.
