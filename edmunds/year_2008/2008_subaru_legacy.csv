Nothing but reliable no problems up to 60K only oil changes and brakes. The interior is a bit small for a family if four so it must go but I would buy another if I had to.

My 2008 legacy provided me with great awd traction, great highway mpg 30+, low maintenance costs. The negatives started at 85,000 miles, head gasket leak, end links failure provided very loud clunking noises, power steering pump wine, heat shield rattle at start up, door panel clunking, dashboard clunking. The problems started in June 2014 and by September I gave up on the car after I realized I have the dreaded Subaru head gasket leak. The car also became a rattle box inside after about 80,000 miles which surprised me. I planned on keeping the car to well over 100,000 miles. City mpg was also sub-par 17-19mpg.","Sunroof, great audio system, comfortable seats, quality paint, projector head lights, big trunk, alloy rims.","Horrible acceleration, 170hp and awd the car is very slow. Improve head gasket design, no one wants to spend $1,500 at 85,000 miles to repair oil leaks. Improve materials inside, the car was a rattle box very early on in its life.

It began to be a money pit. Performance was good, the engine has some power between 3k-4k RPM but is hindered by the outdated 4 speed automatic. AWD was a life saver in the snow. Drove it though 11"" of snow and didn't get stuck once. MPG was better than EPA estimates, 95% highway driving returned a consistent 28-29 MPG.

I've enjoyed my time with this car. It has been very reliable, never been in the shop except for a door light issue (which was caused by the dealership). My only real complaint is the interior space. The back seat isn't really made for anyone 6 feet tall or over. Neither is the front seat, for that matter. I'm just under 6 feet and I have to keep the seat all the way back. But, if you're looking for a car that will never go wrong, this is it. I average about 18 MPG in the city and about 26 on the highway at less than 70mph.

Took a little to get used to heel-toe, but now that I got it the placement makes since.","There is one suggestion, the interior.
Bluetooth would have been nice, but not mandatory.
The nav system has some poorly implemented gimmicks.
On the nav, they have a gauge screen that monitors throttle position, average mpg, and instant mpg.
These are fine, but you have this information already within the gauge cluster in front of you.
It would have been much better to have a boost gauge, oil pressure, and maybe a g-meter.

4.5,Great Value,Skewed ,10/08/2010,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Looked for a slightly-used Legacy GT, but they're quite rare too, so I researched the 3.0R and bought an almost-new one. Know from personal experience that the 3.0 H6 engine can go 130k miles with no more than routine maintenance. Having owned a 2002 WRX as well as a few Saabs, I can say that the 3.0R feels more like a Saab than the WRX. The WRX felt nimble and light, while the Saabs felt more solid and locked-in while cornering. For the mature driver, there's more sport than luxury but young hotshots will find its reflexes a bit slow. Great for someone who likes both Saabs and Subarus. Not much plush but a lot of function. Learning to use all the controls is worthwhile.    ","Value. Multi-mode driveline controls (sI Drive, paddle-shifters, ""tiptronic"" style shifting.) Ergonomics (but I'm 5'6"", 130lb).

I love the style of the interior and found the seats and steering to be spot on.  AWD is a great thing to have with Michigan's erratic weather and this is one of the more economic choices. The Legacy is a bit heavier for the AWD, which may be why some people feel it's a bit sluggish, but it also improves grip and cornering.

The acclaimed S/I drive is amusing, if not practical.  In sport mode acceleration is noticeably boosted from intelligent mode.  Paddle-shifting is also available in sport sharp, though its more burdensome than liberating.   Paddle-shift levers, S/I drive console, and Navigation system all contribute to the impressive interior.  Even after the romance fades, the controls are insightful and convenient.  This car may be your best choice if: a. you drive in all-weather conditions b. you purchase used at a discount","The 3.0R's best feature is not unique.  All Subaru's are endowed with excellent symmetrical AWD. The 3.0R offers Subaru's AWD in a more refined and elegant package, setting it apart from other Legacy and Impreza models.

4.875,Best buy for the buck,Corey ,01/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"The Subaru Legacy 2.5l boxer engine has to be one of the better small size engines on the market today. Besides delivering almost 30 mpg on the high way it can pack a little punch if pushed to its limits. It's more fun to drive than anything I test drove (which included Toyota awd matrix, Nissan altima, Honda accord). The all wheel drive is superb. Anything from heavy rains to deep snow is no match for the symmetric all wheel drive. Last its not cheap by any means but for what you get it is one hell of a deal.

It's the first car I've looked forward to driving every day since I sold my Miata. Acceleration is impressive in sport sharp mode. My TL had crazy, dangerous torque steer when accelerating hard in corners. The Suby is tight, predictable, with a slight rear wheel bias.

It is a great car, having good power, and more luxury than the WRXs I owned. Subaru has done a great job on the entire design, and functionality of the Legacy GT. I have added a Stage one Cobb Accessport, and it changed an already good performing car into a really GREAT performing car.

Very well appointed, great value, above average performance, even providing a bit of luxury but without being pretentious in any way.

I only got the VDC because that's all there was, I mainly turn it off. The leather is nice and along with the wood trim, it makes the car feel much more than $26k.

The trunk is huge, I've gotten 4 suitcases in there with ease. The ride is super smooth, thanks to the Yokohama tires and suspension. I drove it during a heavy snow/ice storm this winter and it never slipped! The engine also makes a great noise when you really push it. Why aren't Subarus as popular as Hondas and Toyotas?

It usually sticks to the road like glue, but I managed to get it to hydroplane in heavy rain.  I attribute this to a combination of driving conditions and slightly overinflated low profile tires.

The Subaru is by far the best deal... no comparison!","The SportShift automatic makes the 2.5i feel much quicker. Love the 4-stage heated seats, heated mirrors, and heated wipers (came in handy during recent ice storm). The subwoofer add-on makes the stereo much better.  The 2008 style changes look great & love the spoiler (looks great from rear view)!","The stereo is still somewhat lackluster even with subwoofer addition... stereo upgrade option is a must in the future.

What I found out after I drove it  was that I not only lost the bad mileage of a V6, but I gained the nice power of a 4 cyl Boxer engine. I have no problem getting onto highways, passing, I even safely avoided an accident with the car's superior handling.

I was contemplating spending some bigger bucks for the Audi A4 or the Infiniti G35x.  Obviously those cars are much quicker, but when I found out that the Legacy had comparable interior, as comfortable a ride and was much cheaper, I decided to go with the Subaru.

I absolutely loved the car.  It looked good.  The interior was well-appointed.  The steering was precise.  The handling was exceptional.  The ride was very good.  The engine was surprisingly responsive and powerful.  The price was extremely competitive. The only negative is the automatic transmission.  The gear changes are sluggish and delayed.  Even when manually changing gears with the paddle shifter, there is significant delay. If not for the auto trans, it gets all ""10s"".",The handling is unsurpassed.  Performance out of the turbo four is impressive.  The crash test ratings speak for themselves.  Truly an exceptional car for the price.,The 5-speed automatic transmission should be scrapped.  It is sluggish.  All gear changes are slow and delayed.  It holds back an otherwise unexpectedly impressive engine.
5,2008 Subaru Legacy ,wrx-man ,11/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just bought it... already have a 100 miles on it and I am very impressed.  I have owned an Audi A6 2.7T, VW GTI and GLX, a Maxima 3.5L SE, and my other car is a '02 WRX.  This car is one of the best I have driven especially for the price.  If I wasn't looking at the Subaru badge, I would have sworn I was driving a BMW or an Audi (dashboard, leather seats, etc).  This car is great on the highway and still firm enough to have fun on the twisty roads.  I was averaging 28 mpg on the highway with a new engine with less than 100 miles. Germany should be afraid with the performance of the Legacy and the proven reliability of Subaru.  I recommend a test drive of the GT, you will not be disappointed","Firm, but not harsh suspension. The aux jack for MP3s is great.  Clean layout of the dashboard.  The interior of the car is very neat and logical.

It really is the Japanese BMW (without the BMW stigma!). The build quality is excellent. The handling, chassis dynamics and rigidity are very impressive. The all-wheel drive system does its job without you knowing. The flat four's power delivery is super smooth, though a little weak. The suspension is very compliant yet tight enough to not be sloppy. Once the motor gets broken in the gas mileage is pretty good. The 5-speed is notchy and vague unless you shift with a light hand and let the shifter find the gates instead of you putting it in the gates.  Overall, it is a tremendous value.","It really is one of the best kept secrets in the sports sedan segment, which I love. I don't see myself on every street corner (can you say 3-series and A4?).  All-wheel drive, the flat four, build quailty, driving dyanmics, etc.","The suspension could be a little firmer. 170 bhp out of 2.5 liters just isn't impressive these days. Add direct injection and give at least 200 bhp out of the 2.5 non-turbo flat four. Finally, allow for at least 225 tires; the 205s that come stock are just way too skinny. Fuel mileage.  "

The 4 speed auto transmission works well with the 2.5 engine. I have no problem merging into the freeways and zipping aound town. The ride is very comfortable and controlled.

Subaru finally had enough of the amenities with the 2008 Limited GT Turbo model for me to make the purchase. What a value! The car is more fun to drive than the BMW, much faster, and hopefully will be more reliable. With discounts and rebates, the car is approximately $12,000 less than a similarly equipped 2008 325xi. The car handles really nicely, much easier clutch than the BMW. I've had it now for 2 months and absolutely no regrets. I added an aftermarket bluetooth kit which fit nicely in the space for the navigation. ",Manual transmission with AWD!,HVAC system could use some refinement.

The Legacy GT out performs all of them at a price that is $10,000 less than the 3 series.  Build quality is superb, and the ride is extremely quiet for a 3200 pound sedan.  The negatives are:  the rear seat is a tad firm, but more than adequate for anyone less than 6 feet on an all day trip and lack of storage compartments.  This is my second Subaru (the first being a forester, which has 71,000 miles on it, and has been trouble free).

As quick as my WRX 0-60, same cornering G, but simply not as fun to drive.  However, this is a much easier car to live with (quiet), and everybody who rides in it loves it.  Quality is same or better than WRX - outstanding.  Other than for clutch, never had a problem with the WRX in 75K miles (never even touched the brakes!).  I'm looking forward to a similar experience with the Legacy GT.","Satellite radio just became a ""must have"" feature in my family.  Black leather looks and feels fantastic.

The perforated leather seats are great and supportive.  Clutch feel is solid thus far and is very easy to drive. ","Great fun playing on twisty country roads, the turbo keeps the car alive as long as the rpms are up, but I do occasionaly miss a nice V8 that has power thru the entire rpm range. Handles great, and the audio is fantastic even without the optional sub.

Performance: still unsure about the automatic transmission.  This is my first automatic in several years and I'm having trouble adjusting.  It's nice when stuck in traffic, but it does take some of the fun out of the car.  The paddle shifters help make up for some of that; even when in drive you can quickly downshift without having to change into manualmatic mode.","AWD, comfortable seats, tho they could use a bit more bolstering, solid feel, good handling and good performance.","Steering wheel buttons too small & don't have tactile differentiation between each other.

Stock summer tires do not perform in winter/cold rain. Needs winter tires. Arm rest useless w/o extension. Turbo lag below 4k. Mud guards black plastic not painted body color."
4.875,Big Improvement over My Honda!,1stSubaru ,06/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love this car!  I looked at many cars over several weeks and decided that the Subaru Legacy was the best value for performance, safety, and comfort.  The car is quiet, smooth, and so elegant inside.  I have so much fun driving the car.  It has the handling of a European sedan and the reliability of a Japanese car.  I recently drove the car during heavy rain and flooding - it maintained its stability like a tank.  I'm very happy with my decision.  If you are considering an Accord or Camry, don't make a decision until you try the Legacy.  You'll be shocked by the difference!","Styling, ride, quietness, crash test results, heated wipers, integrated antenna, powerful headlights, heated side-view mirrors, anti-glare rear-view mirror, subwoofer (a must to upgrade standard audio), and extensive warranty coverage (includes wear items, such as brakes, for 1st 3 yrs).","I love the car, but a few suggestions: override of the passenger climate control would be nice when driving alone, VDC should be standard, needs ""auto up"" for driver's window, and doors should automatically lock after reaching a certain speed."
4.75,Great Car,Lil'B ,05/31/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"What a great car.  My wife and I have been looking for a car for her for quite some time.  We tested MB C Class, BMW 3s and Audi A4s.  The Subaru by far out classed them on the roadways.  Its handling in our opinion matched or outperformed the others.  Its comfort is amazing and the power is wonderful.  The 243 HP feels strong and you never need more.  The car handles superbly at highway speeds and is even better in the curves.  What a great car and I would recommend it to anyone.  My next car will definitely be a Subaru. ","Seats, handling and power.  The overall looks of the car and enough room for our baby seat in the back!","Cooled seats!! Improve the interior fit and finish.  Some parts (i.e. glove box and some trim) still not up to German rivals, but for 10-15K less, it's a great car!!"
4.5,Underrated Camry or Accord alternative,dinomartini ,05/21/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,3,5,"We purchased our Legacy GT Spec B in March after looking at it at the auto show and at the dealership. The interior is very well designed, great seats (heated is a nice touch), everywhere you feel there are no gaps, it's a very well put together car. The 6 speed makes it a very fun car to drive with the turbo 4. Easy to manuever around town, very capable highway cruiser.","Heated seats - very supportive, comfortable for long drives, six speed manual boxer turbo four cyclinder is an amazing engine ",No real improvments needed in my mind.
5,Great car for the price,saad786 ,05/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car has everthing you want and the quality of material they used is worth its price. Handling is really smooth, gas mileage is not that bad but it's not that great, that what you would expect from AWD car anyway. Over all I love this car because of the shape and features that it offers for the price.  ","AWD, new front shape, heated seats, heat windshield wipers and side mirrors for winter.","Should make navigation system standard, not optional."
5,Excellent Car!,Jon ,05/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just traded my 2006 Xterra for this Subaru.  Big difference, so I won't even try to compare the two.  However, I did recently trade in my Mazda 6s, and I must say that the Subaru is almost every bit as fun to drive as the Mazda.  The Subaru has a few points going for it over the Mazda.  1. All Wheel Drive 2. I'm not constantly worrying that the automatic transmission is going to overheat and destroy itself.  3.  The Subaru's transmission computer is adaptive to the driver.  The Mazda had pre-selected shift points that forced the car in overdrive before the RPMs even matched the gearing of the car.  Besides, the car would never downshift while slowing down!  Subaru has won my business.","All-wheel-drive, exterior/interior styling.  Ok, just about everything.",Body roll is a bit excessive.  More aftermarket support for the non-gt Limited edtion.  No available trunk mat for the sedan.  Subaru puts all of their energy into the Outback and barely any into the non-Outback cars.
4.75,Just picked up my 2008 spec B,alwaysjeff ,05/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Went to dealer with wife to have the 05 ob xt ltd serviced and walked out with a new 08 spec B. First one the dealer had. Probably the first one in the area too. We both fell in love with it. It can be compared to a BMW 328xi but $10,000 cheaper. Ride is firm and tight yet smooth even with the 18 inch summer performance tires. Clutch and shifter silky smooth. Handles great. Sticks like glue on turns. Power in stong. Can get out of the way in 6th gear. Everything is where it should be right at your finger tips. Radio and navi are wonderful. This is my 6th subie and definitely the best one. ",Memory seat are a must when 2 people share a car. Radio controls on the steering wheel are real nice. The iPod jack in arm rest is the perfect spot.,Blue tooth would be nice. Cooling seat would be wonderful for the summer. Why oh why can't you get HID lights.
