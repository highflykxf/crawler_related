5,Great car,Shoop ,08/17/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"Loved this car. Had it for 8 years. Still running well at 170k and going. Reading the reviews about leak of power in this engine- don't agree!!! Excellent engine, nice and smooth. Girlfriend loves it too! T6 much noisier. Volvo should continue 3.2L engine.",,
4.75,No Problem(s),melalbert ,12/28/2011,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Purchased 3-year old 2008 XC-70 with only 39K on odometer and just absolutely love the vehicle. I have been able to transport my wife and I and two teens in absolute comfort all over the East Coast, racking up over 10K miles in six months. Everyone sleeps in comfort in their leather seats as I tool along smoothly over those miles. If this isn't my dream car yet, then don't wake me when it shows up.","Best features are the leather, reclining, heated, seats with power controls, power sunroof, A/C in summer and heat controls now that it is cold. The comfort and quiet of the ride is my favorite feature, along with the fact that this car looks really sharp. The storage space behind the two rear seats leaves plenty of space to fit my son's large hockey bag. With the seats folded down, I have been able to fit two adult bicycles on their sides for further adventures.","Disappointments have to do with two of the tires wearing prematurely (for which I blame the original leasee), inability to get the visor-based HomeLink system to recognize my new garage door opener and only a single CD player instead of the six-changer I have in other cars. The inside of the windshield tends to fog up rather quickly. Fuel economy not the greatest but that's not why I bought the car. I bought it to celebrate my anticipated retirement."
2.375,My Last Volvo - Disapointing,jeffmay27 ,11/02/2011,,,4,4,1,1,,2,3,2,2,"I have owned three Volvo's in the last 10 years, always leased them for 4 years and got another one.This was my second XC70.This 2008 XC70 has been horrible, the day I got it one of the radiators sprung a leak and I Was forced to get it serviced on a Satruday.the sales rep did nto include an owners manual or the Volvo hotline.Since then the floating panel had to be replaced, the windows do nto go up and down properly.I took the car in at 82,000Km to get last warranty work done (I was late by 2K) and was told the rules - has to be under 80,000KM.I guess a 10 year history with a Company does not warrant any reverse loyalty.MY last Volvo - I will be glad when my lease is up Jul12.",None,"Where do I start, engine lacks power, original tires rated for 60,000KM, radiator leaks, windows do not work, side panel started to peal off."
4.25,Hold out for a T6!,lindsayg ,05/06/2011,,,4,5,4,5,,3,5,5,3,"My 2008 XC70 was comfortable, reliable, safe, and VERY roomy.I liked it so much that I just bought a 2011 XC70 T6 (the Turbo model).My few ""issues"" with the 2008 were that the suspension was air-ride and was therefore unable to be customized for a tighter ride, the Tiptronic transmission was too slow to react and the brakes were too whimpy for the weight of the car.ALL those issues have been corrected in the 2011 as if they read my mind.However, with a good set of snow tires, my 2008 NEVER got stuck, and we had 2 winters of 2-6 foot snow storms.I went out on roads that hadn't been plowed, through plow piles at the end of my driveway, and it never hesitated. Better than my Jeep!","This is the largest wagon you can get.
When the seats are folded down, the cargo area is astounding.
I loved the rear cargo cubby and the stereo is phenomenal.
It was surprisingly peppy and the gas mileage wasn't too bad.
The AWD is excellent, smooth, reliable, and well balanced.
The black rubber wheel well detail saved my paint (on the car and my garage) on several occassions.
The BLIS system is great (when it works).","It needs bigger, slotted brakes for the weight of the car.
I had to spend a fortune to have a set custom made, but it was completely worth it.
The BLIS system has trouble working when you need it most; in low light and rain.
The Tiptronic transmission needs a lot of refinement, as it is slow to respond and not smooth when it does.
At 40k miles, my fold-in mirrors started misbehaving ($1700 each to replace- yikes!), my AM radio stopped working, and I started to feel more body flex than I would like in a car that solid.
I traded it in on an identical 2011 (but with Turbo!)."
3,Update to an earlier review,an update ,08/28/2010,,,5,5,1,1,,2,5,2,3,I loved the car. At first. Then it broke. A lot. Eventually even Volvo gave up and gave me my money back after 15 months. I really did like driving the car when I could. But it was a lemon.,,
5,Two years and still a winner,BEST WAGON ,06/02/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Bought the XC70 in June of 08. Has not had one problem. Only been in for regular maintenance. I drive highway miles to work and average 28 mpg. Would buy the car again. ,Quiet ride. Great handling. Driving in snow and hardly know it. Comfortable seats. Supreme stereo. More than enough room for clients.  ,Backup camera.
4.5,Fantastic Volvo,Rawfish ,04/23/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,1,5,"Bought mine new and have had absolutely no issues at all.  As for power, it's a bit weak and my 2001 XC70 with the turbo was much faster, but all in all it's enough.  Super safe...that is the main reason I got it. No ONE beats Volvo on that so I'll trade speed (I also had a S60R) for safety.","Adaptive cruise control. Collision warning, steering and those great seats (front.)",Turbo charge and get better gas mileage. I average 18.9 which is terrible in this day and age.
4.625,**No Issues Here**,**no issues here** ,03/08/2010,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,4,5,I have been driving this car for about 3 months and so far it has been a great vehicle.  I recently got back into by old car (00 Outback LTD) which my wife now drives and really noticed the comfort and smooth ride of the Volvo!! I live in CO and drive to the mountains nearly weekly.  It does great getting up the passes.  While not excessive the power is adequate to get around people around you. Fuel eco is really not bad if you do a decent amount of highway miles.  If you stick to city only it sure does drop quite a bit.  I am getting between 20-21 combined.  Some issues with a the air blower (makes a clicking noise) but have not yet tried to take it in for a fix.  Overall a great car!!,Comfort and smooth ride.  Great Audio sound.  Park assist is nice feature. Cargo room good.  Feels well build and beefy.,Sure better fuel eco would be great but is adequate for and AWD car.  Give me a diesel option!!  I don't know why there are not any AWD diesel cars out there.
3,At the end of my lease,luisja ,01/04/2010,,,4,4,2,1,,3,5,2,3,"I am so happy I returned the lease, I've had so many problems with this car that at the end I did not even bother on taking it in to the shop. I would not recommend this car to anybody unless you want to spend every other week at the shop. AC issues, transmission, pieces/hardware coming off outside and inside, thermometer, squeaks and rattles, BLIS system, Park assist, and more. I guess that's the reason why Ford is selling this to the Chinese, too many issues to fix. Check consumer reports and you'll see what I am talking about. On top of all that I've been waiting for Volvo US or the dealer to contact me about my experience but a response never came back.",,
3.125,Big Disapointment,DaveJ ,11/16/2009,,,4,4,3,4,,2,4,3,1,Acquired on 2 yr 12K Volvo lease with promise that I could extend for 6 months. Now that I am at lease end Volvo and the dealer will not honor the original promise. I was offered a $29K buyout do not overpay. I am through with Volvo. I had a 2000 V70XC-SE. After 90K miles major systems failed and cost to keep it on the road were VERY high. Same experience with a prior 240 DL.  You cannot afford to keep them going once they need major service. The 2008 has disappointing performance and mileage. It is underpowered. The BLIS sensors and ultrasonic sensors don't work in the rain or snow.  Any load in the rear causes the springs to bottom out. Check Xenon headlight replacement cost. ,RF key-less entry and starting. Comfortable seating. Corner tracking headlights. Heated seats. Sound system.,Sale of Volvo to China makes future uncertain. Minimal leg room in rear seat. Poor layout for iPod use.  EXTREME deprecation. More travel and stiffness in rear springs.  Needs more power and better mileage.  Extended warranty period.  Service costs HIGH. Honesty from dealer and Volvo leasing.  
4.25,Overall Excellent,BrettW ,11/05/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,4,5,3,4,"Overall, this vehicle has been excellent. I purchased it with 10,000 miles on it and have added another 12,000 in the past 9 months. The car handles snow like a champ- in fact much better than the touted Subaru all wheel drive system (I traded in a 2007 Legacy for this car). It is slightly underpowered off the line, but at 55 miles per hour and above this car has plenty of torque to pass on tough Colorado mountain passes.  The interior design and quality is excellent, and the seats are everything you expect from a Volvo. They wholeheartedly live up to their expectation.  Only issues have been a few rattles and squeaks and a defective speaker that the dealer solved.","Parking sensors, automatic tailgate, Dynaudio sound system, great on the highway, seat heaters in front and rear, great ski car",Fuel economy
4.5,Good enough to buy again,Schubtone ,10/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"We've had this car for just shy of two years and have always liked it much more than the auto mag reviewers. It fits our family's needs perfectly. It's my wife's daily driver and she appreciates the tank like solidity and the overall sense of quality it exudes. The front seats may be the most comfortable of any car out there, especially for long trips. We make many trips to the ski slopes a year and the AWD makes this Volvo unstoppable. The boxy interior configuration is very efficient, great for hauling all sorts of stuff. A great does it all vehicle. Not particularly sporty or fuel efficient but very luxurious. Thats why were getting another now that our lease is coming to an end.","AWD, Solidity, Rational uncluttered controls, comfortable leather seats, overall vehicle size. You would have to go for a much more expensive Wagon, SUV or Crossover from Audi, BMW or Mercedes to get this level of quality. A good value. ","Fuel economy. Quicker (T6 takes care of this complaint, not the fuel economy however). Would like to see the European Turbodiesel option here."
4.875,Great Car!!!!,Jake ,10/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,The XC 70 is one of the best cars that I ever bought. It is amazing on snow/ice.

4.875,Wow - what a great car,Bob _bear ,05/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We recently purchased the 2008 XC70 after an exhausted search.  The ride is exceptional and the seat are very comfortable.  We  are averaging 21mpg which we fell is reasonable.  The build quality so far is also exceptional, not a rattle or the slightest defect to be found after two months.  The park assist is excellent giving parking assist on front, back and sides. Radio and speakers are very good. I like the fact that the controls are very clear, easy to locate and only the controls you really need on the steering wheel -- cruise control on one side and radio on the other side.

4.375,Upgrade,tevis ,04/09/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,3,4,"I've only had this car for a few weeks but I love it.  Selected it, narrowly, over a Subaru Outback Limited because of the extra rear seat room and trunk space.  This car has a beautiful fit and finish, both inside and out.  The controls are well laid out and ergonomic.  It lacks good acceleration but the engine has real power on the highway.  It's no sports car, but drives nicely, is quiet, and luxurious.  After suffering through five years with an Audi Allroad that was a mechanical nightmare (just say no!) I am expecting a much better experience with this car.  So far, so good.

Reasonable acceleration, sounds fine, smooth transmission.  Average fuel economy for weight and off road capability.  Well built and feels solid with lots of airbags.  Plenty of space.

4.875,Love it!,FirstLast ,02/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I am so happy I bought this car.  It handles beautifully in the snow and is very comfortable.  The only negative I have found is the sun visors.  They are not wide enough.  The gap between the visor and the pillar is enough to cause a blinding glare.  When they are straight down, they obscure the road.  Other than that, everything is perfect.   ",The leather is very soft.  The Dynaudio stereo is far nicer than what was standard in my previous car.  The car does not slip at all on snow or ice.  The back seats are even comfortable.  Tail gate is easy to open/close.  Specific key remembering specific seat position is great.,The sun visors!
4.75,More than happy,Paul U. ,12/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Just upgraded my 08 XC70 with a new 08 XC70.  Added more options, like Dyna audio, BLIS, Adaptive cruise and 17"" wheels. Chose Black/Black instead of Oyster/Tan. It feels like I am in a completely different car. Where the other one was nice, this feels more like a luxury automobile. I am so much happier with this car. My first was an early production and this one seems to be tighter, put together better and has a much higher quality feeling to it. I put over 12K on my last one in over 4 months and never warmed up to it. I can see keeping this one for much longer","Adaptive cruise is pretty cool! The Dyna audio with Sirius is a must. I thought  BLIS was kind of a gimmick at first, but you get used to it and wonder why it's not offered on more cars. ","Maybe more horsepower, or a smoother sounding engine.  It could get better gas mileage, but most of my driving is freeway and I'm getting 22, so can't complain too much."
2.25,2008 Volvo XC70 in Canada,NIBS ,09/24/2008,,,3,3,1,2,,2,4,1,2,"This is my third Volvo. Previous to this car was an 02 XC70 and an 850 turbo. My experience with the 08 model is not something to write home about. The fuel economy of this car (avg 13.8L/100kms) is far less than the 2002 and the increase in HP does little to affect performance.  Personally I prefer the older turbo model.  I also like the center stack from the old model as it was slightly turned towards the driver.  Other than cosmetic, there is very little about this car that is better than the previous model.  The car is not as quiet nor as tight.  I currently have 13K kms on this car and it has been back to the dealer five times for warranty repair.  ",Seats. Ipod input. Interior space. AWD.,"More fuel efficient.  More performance leaning towards Audi/BMW.  Quieter interior.  Turn stack towards the driver and dash back to the driver an inch or two.

4.125,Respectible ride,Effigy3 ,09/10/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,2,4,"My previous 7 vehicles were VWs so changing to Volvo was a leap. I had an S40 T5 AWD for 6 months before ""surprise"" 2nd child arrived. Traded for the XC70 for the added room. The ride on this car is excellent for it's class. It feels more like a luxury sedan and less like an SUV. Compared to my previous Passats it feels much roomier which is great for our family of 4. The built-in DVD players are a big hit! (DVD+R work just fine.) It's exactly the kind of solid, thoughtful, classy vehcile that I would expect from a Volvo. I average 18 mpg under mixed driving conditions (22 mpg higway) using a responsible ""kids in the car"" driving style and 89 octane gas.","Exterior styling, adaptive cruise control is now a must have feature for me, 3-blink directional signal when tapped, seats are comfortable, folding side mirrors, parking assist works great but would like to set it as an ""opt-in"" feature rather than an ""opt- out"".",Is it too much to ask to have a power plug or 2 up by the dash rather than near the back of the center console? Add a button on the remote for the power liftgate. Add rubber traction strips in trunk to counter low friction trunk carpet. Make headlight switch actually turn off lights.

It's outstanding in rain and you're 100% confident in matters of traction and handling all the time. Amazingly comfortable overall. My issues? A perpetual rattle in the cargo area. Had it serviced, but the fix lasted only one day. Going back in again soon. Mileage? I had to shut off the display so I wouldn't cry- -long stretches on local roads at 6MPG. I probably average 16MPG overall. Would I recommend it? Yes, but think hard if you're mostly puttering around town because of the mileage.","Parking assist, outstanding radio, highly intuitive controls",Mileage!

4.625,I like this car,NYPAULY ,06/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"I bought a new XC70 in April, so I haven't had a chance to test it in snow and ice. I do a mix of city and highway driving and have averaged 24 MPG. The car handles well and is nice to drive, although I find the transmission hunting for gears sometimes.  I had heard that the transmission is adaptive so that this may stablilize once it adjusts to my driving style. ",The seats are really comfortable and supportive.

Rear leg room is fine as long as the 6-plus footers can compromise a little. Mileage has improved to 23 hywy at 73mph. Performance is great in the high rpm range: paddle shifting works great when passing. We drive to ski county each weekend and frequently encounter snow and slop which the XC handles effortlessly, but I see it could be easy to become overconfident.

The mileage is pretty bad, they really need to do something about it or bring the diesel model. Even you get better mileage with the BMW 5 series. The performance is just OK, at high RPM makes too much noise and the car reacts kind of slow when you press the gas, once you are cruising on the highway everything goes smooth and it handles pretty well.","PCC, BLIS, DVD rear entertainment system. Interior and exterior design. Pretty comfortable family car.","Gas mileage!!

Acceleration comes with pretty noticable noise that is at least two notches louder on the car radio scale (i.e. you have to tune the radio louder by at least that much to hear the same volume) 2. NOTE THIS: in a stop-and-go situation (e.g. congested highway), you may feel not-infrequent jerking. It is as if the auto transmission doesn't know which gear to engage. This is particularly so if you just let go the brake or tap on the gas slightly.","Rain senser, keyless entry, wagon, AWD",Include more in the standard package. The base model is unbecoming Volvo.
