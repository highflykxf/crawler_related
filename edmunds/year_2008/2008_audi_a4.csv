Race track: fun. Highway cruising: smooth and comfortable. Around town: perfect. Load up kids, dogs, luggage, groceries, everything. Bikes, skis, and boats on top no problem. Seriously, for active families who don't want a big SUV, this is about as close to perfect as you can get.

4,2008 Good commuter but definitely not a 3-series.,Iowa architect ,01/05/2016,4,4,5,,,4,4,3,5,,,"Bought 2008 Audi A4 2.0T AWD with 29K miles to replace a 2003 3-series that was starting to nickle and dime me to death; the moonroof breaking and soggy floors (from the doors not moon roof)  was the last straw. Bottom line is I appreciate the A4, but it lacks the getup and go of the 3-series, granted the 325xi BMW was a 3.0L-5 speed manual.   I commute about 70 mi. per day mostly on the interstate, the A4 with sport suspension gives a decent ride and is extremely comfortable for a 35 minute commute with an aver. 24.7 MPG but it lags substantually off the line until you get to about 2500+ RPM, however, at hyway speeds it kicks into passing mode just fine and you'll be going 90 before you know it.  I've driven it 6500 miles and haven't had any maintenance issues yet however I've broken the latch to the storage area in the armrest and broke the hook that holds the sun visor. I've read these are common complaints; I don't think I've been overly 'hard' on it.   The A4 has been good for me by softening my somewhat agressive driving style. If your looking for a nice comfortable ride with some sportiness the A4 is right up your alley.",,
3,Less Impressed Than I'd Hoped,D Manetta ,10/14/2015,4,3,5,,,4,4,3,4,,,"Purchased this car in 2014 after my 2006 A3 2.0T was totaled by a hit-and-run driver. The 2008 A4 had 28K miles from a warm-weather state and was a one-owner car from a vacation home - well cared for with full service records based on time, not mileage. I would have preferred Quattro, but the price and mileage were hard to beat. I should have listened to my instincts. Vastly different character than the A3... this A4 feels like a luxury car without any sporting pretense. The CVT transmission is horrendous - slow to respond in standard mode, jerky engagement from dead stop... in Sport mode, it holds RPMs far too long at low speeds before initially ""upshifting."" Engine vibration is far more apparent than it should be for any luxury vehicle - the same engine in the A3 was less prone to vibration. Brakes on the A4 are less direct, more difficult to modulate and with longer pedal travel than the A3 - might be fixed with stainless steel brake lines. Steering is much lighter and less dynamic as well; same with the suspension which is calibrated for a compliant, soft ride over handling - lacking the balance of a BMW 3-series. Lastly, the climate control is noticeably less accurate than the A3... the interior temp seems to be about 5 degrees higher than the set point during all seasons. Might be a faulty part or just the nature of the system - hard to tell and not worth tearing apart the climate controls to find out. On the good side, the car is indeed comfortable as a highway cruiser. The interior materials are top notch. The trunk seriously swallows more cargo than my wife's Ford Escape. Instruments are legible and direct. For the price paid, the car came well optioned for a 2008 model - although bewildering that certain features now standard on mid-level cars (like heated seats, Bluetooth and USB/AUX inputs) were nowhere to be found on my A4. It's a handsome car that will serve as a good family hauler for a couple of years - a car that I wouldn't be ashamed to take clients between point A and B. Lesson learned though - it's not a driver's car in the same way a 3-series might be. No major mechanical issues so far (knock on wood)... replaced post-purchase: an A/C diverter valve, the engine thermostat and the window lock switch. Not bad for a mid-2000s Audi. Overall, I'm not sure I would buy the A4 in this configuration again... at this price point for a used vehicle, there are more competent sport sedans and more reliable family sedans that cost less to operate.",,
4,"It's all fun 'n games, until catastrophe happens..",Arbeitspferd ,09/03/2015,4,4,4,,,2,5,4,4,,,"I have an '08 A4 Quattro 6MT Special Edition S-line. I bought it as a CPO car in 2011 with 36k miles. The car is absolutely sublime to drive in every way, even with the firm suspension. The first year I owned it, I put over 25k miles commuting 100mi each way for work, across a mountain range. The traction control and AWD have literally saved my life twice hitting black ice on a bend in the highway. Very little issues with the car; cruise control module went out, covered under warranty; ignition switch died last year out of warranty, $160 total (cheap). Then one day, accelerating onto the interstate, the engine shut down leaving me just enough momentum to coast over to the shoulder (on a massive bridge, no less). After having it inspected and diagnosed at the dealer, it turns out a high pressure fuel pump exploded, literally. It blew metal shrapnel into the engine destroying the block and fuel system. A piece(s) of shrapnel severed the intake cam chain, seizing the cam and destroying most of the remainder of the engine. The engine is damaged beyond repair and has to be replaced, to the tune of over $7500! Audi has generously offered to cover 25% up front, but I am currently working with Audi of America to see if they can extend that courtesy a bit more. At this point, I haven't decide if I'm going to keep the car after all this or just dump it. Either way, I'm out as much as $6k on a car only worth $11k...If you want a car that is nearly perfect to drive, this is the one. Specifically the 2008 owing to it's having the new AWD system (which is MUCH better than the old Haldex system).

4.25,Looking forward to the lease to end,Jon ,11/29/2010,,,3,5,5,2,,5,5,4,5,I lease my cars for 3 years for multiple reasons.  The most important reason is because I want a dependable car that's not going to break down and is under warranty. I've been towed twice since I got this car new in April of 2008.  The first time was when a fuel sensor failed. I was stranded at a stop sign.  Audi's roadside assistance was so bad that I had to join AAA to have my car towed.  I was  told me there was a recall going out on the fuel sensor. With 30m miles on the car the car stopped moving forward or backward at an intersection.  I couldn't put the car in any gear other the gear it was in. To Audi's praise Audi's roadside assistance was great.  Repair: a bolt had fallen off. ,All wheel drive.  The car is great in the snow even without snow tires. Lease favorite feature are the never ending idiot lights.,"Need more cubbyholes for storage of little things.  Recent prior cars were Honda Accord EX and Saab 900s.  Both had much more space for storage of things such as maps, gloves, hats.  "

Armrest is a bit awkward-it covers the parking brake. I've cracked my elbow on it several times when it's lifted up. Armrest lid latch broke-this is a common problem. Dealer replaced under warranty.   Overall, lot of fun to drive. Before buying, I drove two G35's and three 328i's, and don't regret for a second going with the Audi. The Infinity and BMW had much more power, but A4 was just more fun to drive. G35 had too much plastic in the cockpit. BMW oddly enough felt too refined - like it was driving and I was along for the ride. ","Great driving feel. Interior, exterior styling. Simple and sensibly laid out controls.

Doesn't have the low end torque, but it does get 24 miles to the gallon in the city and 30 on the highway! No issues with oil or anything else other reviews have stated (knock on wood).

There is a spot on my way home from work where I literally brace myself for the impact...and it's not a big bump.  This is the only car I have owned in my life that I have to buy a quart of oil to add to it in between oil changes.  At any given time I would have anywhere from 1 to 3 warning lights on at the same time.  I just traded it in last night for an Acura TL and was thrilled to say goodbye!",I like the exterior styling.

The dealership was courteous and professional each time I had the car in, but the problems kept popping up.  When the car was functioning properly, I enjoyed driving it. My main complaint was the automatic transmission - the Drive transmission setting shifted painfully slowly and enhanced the awful turbo lag. The Sport transmission setting was better, but it had to be shifted manually with the paddles into 6th gear when traveling < 80 mph.

I have always had a soft corner for Audi when compared to BMW (a personality trait of always siding with the underdogs).

It is the one feature that really does not live up to the rest of the car, but it works well enough and is fortunately in the glovebox"
4.75,Stick to the Road,Waiting for Alfa ,05/07/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,4,5,5,"This is my 3rd A4 Avant (1999; 2003; 2008). I recently had to retire my 1995 Alfa 164LS. I purchased this to drive along with our 2003 A4 Avant. The plan is to retire the 2003 and keep the 2008 once Alfa returns to the USA. The car is quite sporty in nature.  It appears as if the new A4 will have more driver right leg room, but it is unclear whether the new Avant will be offered as a 6 speed. We only have had manual transmissions with sport suspension. The 2008 2.0 engine is more throaty and powerful than previous models. The four wheel drive sticks like glue.  The 2.0 torque is limited, but the acceleration is fine, with little turbo lag. Forget BMW and go for it.",Four wheel drive; throaty engine; exterior style; optional sport suspension; optional stereo/satellite radio upgrade,Xenon headlights and dimming rearview mirror as stand-alone options; more driver right leg room; standard or optional seat uprade in 2.0 base model
5,This is an awesome SUV Alternative,Nick ,05/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My other vehicles are 911 turbo, Mustang GT convertible, Cayenne S.  This vehicle has become my favorite. I can drive it over highway 17 in California with vigor. I drove it to Tahoe with the family, a roof box and a lot of gear. It was a blast.  It compensated well on icy patches and blasted through the snow. I can put my golden retriever in the back, pick up the family and still enjoy the ride. The S mode and paddle shifters make this a stealth sports car. I enjoy the ""S"" suspension features and the mileage of the 2.0T. It feels like a Porsche station wagon. I predict that these wagons will see a resurgence in the near future. The Avant gets 22 around town and 28 highway.","Daytime running lights, buetooth cellphone, stellite radio, IPOD adapter, S mode on tranny is very intuitive, paddle shifters, visibility, traction, rear storage room, ease of ability to put things on the roof.",The improvements that will will debut on the 2009 will address many of the minor complaints. The sound system interface is dated on this version and the rear legroom  could be better.  Would like more information on the trip computer screen in front of the driver. 
4.5,Love my A4,PJ ,04/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,3,5,4,Our experience with the A4 has been great my wife loves it. Very economical with gas. As the first time owning an Audi I was not totally sold the first time I drove the car. I immediately noticed the jerk (as if I was driving a stick shift vehicle) I was told it was the SVT in the vehicles transmission. I only different from our Acura TL and former Lexus model was the oil light came on at 4K miles because shortness of oil. The car ate the oil as if it were candy. Audi told us the vehicle does that within the first couple of 1000's miles. Very small car with great fuel economy joined with a sexy exterior look.,"Bluetooth device, exterior look and acceleration for a four cylinder is great. Oh let me not forget the sound system is wonderful.",Hate when you turn on the car and throughout a glitch of the bluetooth. Improve the SVT transmission jerk.
4.25,What people should expect,Car Reality ,04/08/2008,,,4,4,5,4,,4,4,5,4,"The Audi A4 a compact car with plenty of room for the front seat users.  It is not intended for 5 passengers. The 2.0 liter is very strong for a 4 cylinder so you need to keep in mind it can't be compared to a 6. Interior is very well built. Exterior is very sharp. This car has all the power anyone should need. If you ease up on the pedal it will get very good gas mileage as I have experienced 29 miles per gallon so far. You can get a larger car if you pay 15 to 20 grand more, or you can wait for the 2009 model that will be larger. This car compares to all its competitors and is better in some ways than 328Ix, C class, G35X.","Strong 4 cylinder engine. Great gas mileage. Great room in front seats. Great seat heaters, comfortable car for two adults. ","More standalone feature options, instead of packages. Portable nav option like BMW and Volvo that show all the dealerships."
5,A blast to drive,Stiffler ,04/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have had this car for two weeks now and so far I am very pleased with the performance. I love the way car handles yet maintains a decent fuel economy. It makes me go look for some curvy roads. Strongly suggest this car if you enjoy the driving.,"Styling: inside & out, price, overall driving pleasure ","Make i-pod, & HID standard features."
4.75,Great car so far,Dan ,03/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"Have had this for just over 2 weeks and 800 miles and so far I'm very pleased.  I do wish the 2.0T had more power but I knew going into it that it was a trade-off for better fuel economy.  Setting aside the lack of power at the low end, I love the way the car drives and handles.  Been in one early spring snowstorm so far and it held the road beautifully.  Quartz Gray color is stunning.","Price, features, overall driving experience","More power off the line, larger back seat, sun visors seem cheap for a nearly $40k car"
4.875,A Beast,mba ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The car is just gorgeous, and a blast to drive.  Went for the throaty 3.2 over the 2.0, and I'm glad I did.  Not only for the engine, but also for the equipment that's standard instead of optional.  It's fast and handles like a dream.  I actually want more snow. ","The xenon adaptive headlights are incredible.  Also love the steering wheel paddle shifters.  Great sound system, fit & finish, materials.  Just tremendous.",Wish the song titles were displayed when I'm playing off my iPod.  Could use a little more lateral support from the seats.  Better placement of the lever for the steering wheel tilt.
3.125,A4 lemon?,wayne1984 ,02/26/2008,,,4,4,1,1,,1,5,4,5,"Had the car for 5 weeks  and loved every minute. Hit 2115 miles, oil pressure light came on and car died. Threw a cam, needs entire engine rebuilt, possibly major design flaw with 08's. 4 weeks for repairs so far, and I still don't have it back.  I'm trying to get Audi to get me into a brand new replacement vehicle, but they aren't budging ( they just want to fix it). I didn't pay a premium for a rebuilt car. So much for Audi quality","When it worked the AWD was awesome, very good in the snow, the one time I got to use it. Handling was great.","#1 More reliable Engine! breaks after 2000 miles-- UNACCEPTABLE!! #2 Heated side mirrors- wish this was option #3 Briefly drove the Q7, and loved the tinted rear view mirrors, wish this was an A4 option #4 Ipod adaptor, I love / hate this; has great sound, but try to find a song, no song info"
5,Sweeet ,jeff ,01/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My first Audi (drove a 1.8T jetta for 5 years); this is one sweet ride.  Gone is the turbo lag I had in Jetta, probably due to the Audi manual transmission.  Nice smooth shifting, very good acceleration, fuel mileage has been in upper 20s, but car only has 2000 miles on it.  The appearance of the grille is very sporty and somewhat mean looking :).  I got basic car with 17"" wheels, leather, bluetooth and iPod.  The interior is beautiful and very comfortable.  The ride is smooth and does this car love curves! Overall, the cost of this car is very reasonable.  Overall, very pleased at this point.  Highly recommend anyone taking a look.",6 speed manual; nice looking rims; bluetooth; overall appearance is sharp.  ,Make satellite radio standard or don't put the antenna on top.  Steering column is busy with all these things sticking out.  the voice activated dialer should have a train mode.  
3,Jetta with the name Audi on the grille,WB ,01/02/2008,,,2,5,2,2,,3,3,3,4,"I have an '04 Jetta and i'm completely unhappy with it, probably because I have owned volvos before. I have had this car for about 4 days now and when I get into the car, I feel like I am in the Jetta. The console is still small, with the small cup holders underneath, the ignition jingle never stops until both the driver and passenger have thier sealt belts on, and just all the little things about the Jetta are in A4 that would make you skeptical to pay $41,000 for it. The turbo charger has a delay when u push on the accelerator. I do have to say though, that the seats are comfortable and the styling outside is excellent.",Transmission-7spd--great on gas mileage and fun to drive in sport shift mode. Seats--very comfortable. Good power steering is smooth.,"Update the car... needs push button start, engine sounds cheep, power passenger seat, make the alarm SOUND like an alarm-it's not loud even if you are standing right next to the car, V6 standard as well as more standard equip, put a real console in, with cupholders in thier own spot"
4.875,The car I always wanted,Cristian ,12/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"It's indeed a dream car.  The design is excellent, top execution and materials. Everything is balanced with very good taste. The danger in this price range is sending the message that you bought the car to show-off. On the contrary, A4 shows that you have a fine taste of spending your money (let's admit it, it's not a cheap car and everybody sees that).  The 2.0T has only 200HP but is really powerfull provided that you now how to drive a 4 cyl Turbo engine, i.e., buy a manual transmission and do not ask the engine for maximum thrust at 1500rpm. Downshift, step on the gas and see what a Turbo engine can do.  For me, A4 is the ideal compromise between price, aspect and driving experience. ","The 4WD transmission and the electronic breaking, steering, stabilization, etc, integrate very well. It's a pleasure to race the car, I am saying that as one who drives well but not professionally.  The clutch is very smoooth to operate, leading to better control and avoiding unnecessary weariness.",Too many controls on the levers and on the steering wheel. They do not look bad but maybe it's a little bit too much. You should be able to remove the cruise control lever if you like.  I would like an additional needle on the rpm display to show the engine torque. This is technically easy to do.
5,Amazing Vehicle,PSZ ,12/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"There are not enough superlatives to accurately describe this car.  Fit and finish are fantastic. It offers superior comfort (I'm 6'5""), handles like a champ, provides surprising power from its strong 2.0 turbo and provides over 30+ highway MPG!  This is a very special automobile.","Engine, sound system, styling and fuel economy.","Cargo net in trunk, rear back up sensors on 2.0T (available only on the 3.2 litre V6)."
4.875,Get the S-Line,jeff howard ,11/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is my third Audi, and by far my favorite. I enjoy the throatiness of the turbo and think that the new 2.0 is one of the ten best engines in the world. I confess to dropping quattro this time both to improve fuel economy and to free up enough $ to spring for the S-Line. Sure all new 2008 sedans have S-line styling on the body, but not the 18"" wheels, sport suspension, and superb interior trim. My advice is to spring for it, as you hardly ever see the 18"" wheels on A4 and it enhances the look tremendously. I am delighted, too, with the granite gray color which shifts with the changing light and weather... always a pleasure to come across it anew.",Great fun-to-fuel efficiency ratio. Interior design and finish is the best on the market.,I do miss the halogen headlights which came with a compass indicator in the rear-view mirror and automatically controlled the lights.
5,Great Ride,John ,11/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We have only had the car for a month, but we are loving it so far.  The ride is very comfortable and quiet, yet the vehicle holds the road extremely well. The styling of the car is beautiful inside and out.",We love the look and the feel of the vehicle as we are driving it.,The options can be a bit pricey and there is a small amount of turbo lag that takes some getting accustomed to.
4.875,Damn good car,cant say ,11/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I've looked at everything - BMW, Acura, MB, Lexus, etc - finally settled on the Audi and haven't regretted it since. The car is a pleasure to drive and it's obvious that someone put some thought into building this monster. Fun to drive, beautiful inside and out - can't get enough. I didn't go with any of the ""extra"" options - they're a bit pricey and don't really add much to the experience. I think you can figure out when to turn on the lights and wipers.","The interior lighting at night is awesome, MP3 player works very well, quattro, huge trunk, and pretty good mileage. Can't wait for snow!","Engine is a bit loud, more power from the start would be nice. Wish the volume control was on the left side of the steering wheel like the BMW - it's not easy to turn down the volume and answer a phone call at the same time :)"
5,Great Car So Far,Nick ,09/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've only had it for 3 days, but I love it so far.  Good performance for the engine size and handles great.  I was torn between getting a pure sports car or pure luxury car, but the A4 has enough of both to please me.  The Sport setting on the auto transmission is great for playing around, but sucks the gas too much for day to day driving.  I also can't wait for some snow to test the AWD out.","Tiptronic transmission, sporty look, pretty decent gas mileage (compared to the Blazer I was driving) and really nice interior.",Passenger power seat should be standard.
5,Can You Say Slot Car?,Drifter ,09/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just picked up a new 08 A4 2.0T Quattro with Sport Suspension. (Previously drove an 06 A4 CVT front wheel drive.)  After driving the front wheel drive Audi for 2 years (and really liking the way it handled), I was amazed with the Quattro's road handling prowess! On the way home from the dealer, I was on the freeway and naturally fiddling with the stereo adjustments and didn't notice that I was approaching a sharp curve to the left while making a transition from one highway to another. I entered the corner at about 65 (40 advised) and started to go for the brake, but as I turned the wheel, the car simply took the corner like it was on a rail.  I kid you not! ","Sports car-like handling, 6 speed paddle Tiptronic shifting, Sport shift and over-all interior and exterior looks.","The ""S-Line"" should be a complete suite of upgrades, not just the exterior treatment. Audi should not have so many optional upgrades.  Maybe just 2 packages. Regular and premium?"
4.875,A true sports wagon,Keith ,08/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Looked for a wagon (not SUV) with some style and performance, settled on the A4 with 6-spd and am extremely happy so far. This car is as fun to drive as my 325i (and much more than my CLK430) and can carry stuff to boot. I have had no reliability issues after 3 weeks. I know this isn't the final word, but no horror stories.  So far I get about 25 mpg around town (suburbs, not city) and more like 29 hwy, a little less if I feel like having fun.  It is not really a lightweight car so this seems acceptable.  Interior is very quiet and comfortable, my first 5-hour road trip flew by.  Can't wait to see what quattro can do in the snow. ","Handling, handling, handling - more important than raw horsepower.  This car just wants to go and the 6spd lets you maneuver when you need to.  Quiet, no rattles or squeaks (incl. brakes) as I've seen others report.","More rear-seat legroom.  I don't mind the cupholder/armrest thing that much, you can use the front cupholder and armrest without a problem, it's only when you have a tall cup in the rearmost holder.  Rear seats that fold flatter. iPod interface could be smarter and show playlist names."
5,So far...,newaudi ,07/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just picked up my new Audi A4 quattro 2.0T and can't get over this car.  I've only had it a week, but I've been entirely impressed thus far.  The feel and ride are just great, solid and smooth.  Handling is sure and secure.  I owned a 2001 VW Jetta GLX previously and was a little unsure of going back to a four cylinder, but the power of the 2.0T feels even better than the V6 in the Jetta.  I was also concerned about engine noise and gas mileage.  The growl of the Audi exhaust makes me smile and I'm getting about the same in mileage as I was in the Jetta - made the switch back to a 4 cylinder worth it.  I got the Audi loaded up with extras.",Having no door lock stems.,Making a tilting passenger side view mirror a standard feature.  It made a difference in my Jetta.
4.5,2008 Audi A4 2.0T CVT,Jim V. ,07/25/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"The car can be summed up in one phrase: performance and luxury in a compact design. I drove a 2003 and 2005 3.0L A4 prior to getting this one and the performance stands up well. There is definitely noticeable turbo lag, but this can probably be overcome by changing driving habits. The sound of the engine will also take some getting used to as the turbo is a bit ""throatier"" than I'm used to. The car handles extremely well, though, hugging curves and accelerating very smoothly. The now-standard S-Line exterior features definitely give the car a sportier look. The interior is outstanding. The layout is getting better and the list of available features is exhaustive. In all, a great car!","Tiptronic paddle shifters, selectable sunroof opening, instrument panel computer, exterior S-Line styling, better cup holder placement, and bi-xenon adaptive headlights.",Power outlet placement and design could be improved as I had problems finding a good place to plug my GPS into. Steering wheel touch controls don't allow you to change between sources and the up/down for CD's tracks works backward from what you'd expect. The rear seat is relatively small.
