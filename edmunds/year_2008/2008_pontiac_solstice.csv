4,Perfect for a weekend for 2,Carl ,07/13/2015,4,4,4,,,4,4,4,4,,,"My wife and I where looking for a little 'mid-life crisis' fun - we are both in our early 50's.  I had previously owned a 1974 Fiat Spider in my youth, so we looked at used re-conditioned Spiders - while from a nostalgia stand point it seemed fun, it wasn't practical - too many modern bells and whistles missing.  We came across the Solstice on at a used sports car dealer with a good reputation - in really well kept shape and low mileage for a 2008 (30k) and attractive price.  Very happy with it - we didn't need top end performance , but it is sporty, turns heads  and a fun weekend play 'toy'.   Stowage for gear isn't the greatest, but we can get what we need in it for an extended weekend get-away - a small duffle bag, camera and a couple of lens.   Well worth the price we paid, decent gas mileage and alot of fun.",,

The car is beautiful and I've got some great and interesting compliments on it. It is great fun and I love it, but there are some bad points. As several others have said, the interior design is lacking. No storage space, bad cup holders, the temperature control is one of the worst I've seen (should have been more like my 2000 Firebird).

It handles well - I don't have a turbo - so have to wind the gears - but I'm cool w/that - and it doesn't seem to mind either.  I scratch the tires - every time I get a chance! LOL,The way it looks! I love the wide tires.  Also - I have the Monsoon speakers and it ROCKS!  Good gas mileage.  Good reliable car - never any problems.,Wish the 08 model had bluetooth - and the no spare tires is kind of weird.

Most of the reviews list similar negatives which are true, but as for the storage issues, lack of a spare tire, fussy top operation, plasticky interior and ridiculous cupholders, etc..., I would not want any of these items improved if it compromised the beautiful looks or low price of the car. Performance in my base model, while nothing exciting, is adequate. I am 6' 215 lbs and the car is plenty comfortable, although I am wishing I had gotten power windows, due only to the fact that the window crank protrudes in to the area where my left leg rests and is a bit uncomfortable.

I have never found that lowering the top is a problem. And, I routinely complete the task, in 15 seconds. Raising it is only slightly more time consuming, requiring 28-30 seconds. The power window switches could have been better placed. I would have preferred wind up windows, and side pockets. The cup holders, I really could care less. A bigger trunk, would be a great help for weekend touring. But with some creative packing, two can go on a weekend cruise. I also, do not require A/C in a roadster, and would have appreciated the weight savings, and possible extra horse power. Stereo 1st class!","Power, body style, handling, traction is great.

I paid just over 16.5k for a brand new '08 with the wheel package, Monsoon radio (a must), and a few other goodies.  The car stickered at $26,062.  An unbelievable deal and I'm pleasantly surprised with the ride, handling and even the performance of the 2.4 ltr.

As for the car critics 'not enough room, interior needs better styling, needs more power and handling,' don't get me started. If it were up to the major critical magazines and publications we would all be driving BMW's and Mercedes anyway.

I just took our GXP on a road trip to support a SWAT team's training operation.

Other cars I have looked at did not have the hip room and head room that I needed. The Solstice has both. One other car I looked at had so little room, I looked OVER the windshield when seated in the car and I could not close the door because it hit my leg. Other than being very comfortable in the Solstice, it is really fun to drive. Other reviews complain about the meager trunk space, all I can to say is this car was only meant for hauling - well you know!!",I opted for the GPX model because it had better fuel economy and more power.

Drink holders are terrible, and need at least one small compartment for things like change or a cell phone: interior has no storage bins!  Power top would be nice too."
4.875,I feel 16 again- thanks Pontiac,louis chad ,11/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I just bought the GXP on my 60th birthday and it has totally jump started my life. I live in northern Minnesota, but will use this care selectively all winter. You just can't store this one. It will, although be in a slab heated work shop with me. I'll visit the wife on weekends if time permits. Thanks again Pontiac.","The outside styling, the cool wheels and of course the cool deep blue color and overall performance. Look out all you other sissy roadsters.",Front grille area could be classed up and a power top would be nice as an option.
4.875,2008 Great Car,KAR ,10/31/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"The 2008 Solstice is a great car and fun to drive. This year the acoustic headliner, 1 year of OnStar, XM radio, input jacks, are all standard. The handling is also great with the Stabilitrac system. The exterior design is second to none. ",The style.,Remove the two rear cupholders. 
4.875,2008 Solstice,happy owner ,10/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a great car! The handling is great, no front end wandering, takes corners like they are not there. The fit and finish are teriffic, I worked in the auto industry for 30+ years and know about fit and finish.  Have always driven GM and had two bad cars when GM had the quality issues, but those are gone and the product is now excellant. The styling looks good - we have had comments of ""Cool car, Good wheels, Love your car"" from teens and adults.  You can ride with the top down at highway speed and carry on a conversation, and we do not have the opt. wind screen.  With the top up wind noise is non-existent, just the soft rumble of the exhaust.  A pleasure to drive!",Styling and engineering,None for the car other than increasing production.
4.5,Head Turner,Fullthrottle ,10/04/2007,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"An exceptional vehicle. Beautiful design(best GM has put together in a while)and always gets the looks. Simple with clean lines. Has that classic roadster feel. The car has plenty of pick up and power, always wants to go. (oh that turbo) So easy to spin those tires. Has pretty solid handling. Storage could be an issue for some. Interior is like a cockpit. Clean in design. Cup holder placing is in an odd spot(I dont use the 2 on the back wall. Stereo has great sound, love the mp3 adapter. Seats on the GXP are great, road trips have been really comfortable(Pack light). ",Car design. The whistle of the turbo! and the subtle low exhaust and just says this thing is dangerous. ,"Storage, some blinds spots when the top is up. Perhaps little more help from the mirrors."
3.875,Almost there!,AJ ,08/15/2007,,,2,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I purchased a red 2008 GXP last weekend. This car has a lot of potential with a few changes. Interior materials are ok but not up to the same standards as the MX-5. Trunk space with the top down is non-existent. The manual gearbox should be improved to minimize the effort required to move between gears. The best way to describe it is clunky. Despite these drawbacks, the car is a lot of fun to drive, gets a lot of attention from admirers and is fast.",Great looks and lots of power.,Improve the manual gearbox so that it is easier to shift. Lack of storage when top is down.  Placement of cup holders.
4,Hot Car But Needs a Chrome Grill,Lisa ,08/04/2007,,,3,4,4,4,,5,4,4,4,"My previous car was BMW Z4 3.0.  So far, I really like the GXP's performance. The exterior is hot! My only beef with the exterior is the black grill -- it looks cheap!  Why not keep the same chrome grill as the Solstice?  The interior is sleek -- the seats hug you.  However, there is no storage space.  I can't even find any place to keep my garage door opener.  I've noticed that the window controls are in an awkward place -- inevitably, my elbow triggers the windows. The biggest pain is the manual top -- miss the Z4's automatic top.  There is no trunk space with the top down.  Wish they offered navigation system as option. But can't beat the price and bravo to Pontiac for its cool design!","Exterior is hot! Love the unique design - wish BMW and Mercedes would design similar car. My black GXP turns heads!  Great stereo system.  MP3 hook-up is part of the package.  Love the XM radio option.  This sucker is fast!Comparing it to my Z4 3.0 (in sport mode), this car has faster pick-up",Needs a chrome grille! More storage space inside and in the trunk. Offer Automatic top as an option. Offer navigation system as an option. Don't buy rims that aren't on the car - - you will pay 3x the price! Move the window controls forward.
