5,Camry or Accord......think again!,GoFusion! ,10/28/2016,4,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"Let me start this off by saying that this is my first car. My dad owns a black '09 Fusion with the sport package, and I loved the way the car rode, handled, and looked. When shopping for one, I searched for one exactly like my dad's, and I ended up snagging a red '08 Fusion with the same sport package with 85k miles on it. This car was previously owned by a Ford technician, and it drove like one. The trunk is huge....enough to swallow multiple bags of mulch from the Home Depot. Excellent front seats, a unique yet fresh design, and bulletproof reliability merely adds to the multi-talented nature of this car. The Camry had worse reliability and reviews for the same '06 to '09 period as this car, yet it sold by the thousands just because it was a Toyota. The thing I like the most about my Fusion is the handling, as it is extremely neutral and gives excellent feedback of the wheels and road alike. My biggest gripe might be the 2.3 liter four banger under the hood, as it only produces 160 hp. Or it could be that some of the paint in the front started to peel after having it for a year, but a new paint job could fix it. That said, the five-speed auto transmission gives crisp upshifts, and makes the car feel a bit faster than the 158 lb-ft torque rating suggests. I've had no problems under the hood or with the quality of the build, plus after three years, it has aged beautifully. This car should last me a very long time. And when it does expire, I know exactly what my next car will be......and it won't be a Camry!",,

Very quiet interior, comfortable and smooth. Cons: The interior, imo, is a bit vanilla to my taste, also the door handle (on the driver side) is peeling .

It was cheaper than Camry and frankly fit me - a big guy - like a glove. So far, smart move.It has some dumb little design annoyances, but the conveniences outweigh them.It's as economical and reliable as a Camry, offering more space in leg room, overhead, front area storage, back seat seating, and a huge trunk.The handling on turns is like a race car, yet the turning radius getting into a parking space is poor; always an extra maneuver for a tight spot. ","Even this no frills model has AUX plug inside console box for iPod. It has all the features I wanted. Great AC for me in FL.

Like I said above, cornering is just awesome, better than son's Scion tC. 

Lots of varied and generous storage.

I get 25-27mpg in mixed city-highway driving. Once at 5th gear, it sails along with very low RPMs. Highway runs about 30+mpg - great car if you do mostly highway driving.

Solid and consistent with no mechanical issues in my 12k miles; now car has almost 50k.

At 6'5"" 250lbs 55yo, I'm very comfy. I really like this car. ","Yes, 4 cyl is underpowered, especially compared to Camry, but I've adapted. I'm sure 6cyl is better but don't make it a requirement. You'll do fine with 4cyl.

Yes, it's a bit loud; engine noise and at high speeds. Not that it's a real problem, but you will wish you could get a bit more volume from the stereo sometimes.

Yes, it's got a weird left handedness and other quirky designs. I'm used to headlights and wiper control on the column sticks. Not here; only one column stick w/wipers only, plus push forward hi-beams. Headlight dial is on lower left dash. I'm always turning on wipers when I want lights.

Perhaps it was the change from an SUV to a sedan, but I have been duly impressed. You wouldn't think a 160 HP FWD sedan would really pack a punch, but the Fusion can go in a hurry if you wanted it to. This car has been so much fun to drive, I've been having a hard time maxing out the mileage, which has been as high as 31 HWY/MPG.

It doesn't beg to be driven hard like an Altima, and isn't as refined as the Accord, but still drives good and looks great.  SYNC is a brilliant system, but I am having issues using a thumb drive to store music that Ford can't seem to solve.

It is hard to get over the past image of Ford, but this car is a winner and certainly deserves very serious consideration. The only areas needing improvement are the night mirror (too much reflection from the map light fixture), and it is a little underpowered. The I-4 is fine for most uses, but if you can afford the V-6, get it.","Nice ride, love the included Sirius radio and the parking assist. Seems to be of good sturdy quality. Reviews place Ford at least even with the imports, if not better, in reliability. Trunk space is great for a mid-size.","A little more power in the I-4 needed (how can the imports make a more efficient engine?). Also, move the map lights forward so that the fixture does not show up as a reflection in the night mirror. A tire upgrade would better showcase the ride capabilities (my other car is a Nissan, tires matter)"
5,I love this car,judy g ,09/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Purchased this car 2 weeks ago and I love it. Test drove many others and kept coming back to the Fusion. I am currently coming out of a Camry and  I was afraid that I would be disappointed in the quality of another brand, I couldnt have been more wrong. I am more than impressed with everything about this vehicle. I went with the v6 and glad that I did, for the difference in mileage from a 4 cyl, it's nice to know that you have the power if you need it and the engine noise is much more quieter.","Sirius radio, sync, moonroof, and all those extra toys",Turn signal seems to be a bit high and there is a blind spot when backing due to the spoiler.

Great gas mileage, roomy and comfortable interior and sporty exterior. I have had it 2 weeks and absolutely love it. Almost bought a Pontiac G6, but called my brother before driving it off the lot - he told me to check out the Fusion before I signed any papers - thank goodness I called him! Found out later that the G6 ranked #20 out of 23 cars and  Fusion ranked #4. So many great features at such a low cost - couldn't believe all the standard equipment. Excellent safety rating. I can't stay out of it!  I absolutely love it!",How did I live without Sync? Can't imagine not having it now!,"Only 2 suggested improvements - 4 cylinder needs a little more pep.

First of all let me say - I am an avid auto enthusiast and have owned over 30 cars in my 30 years of driving. I originally liked the car a lot, now I love it! Have gotten numerous compliments on it. Vapor silver with the 18"" wheels and black/red interior is awesome! The best attribute is the handling. Handles almost as well as my previous Nissan Sentra SER's but has 100% better ride quality. If this car had another 50 - 75 HP , I would be in auto heaven. Upgraded audiophile package is superb! Ford skeptics - drive this car!","Performance package, audiophile sound system with SYNC, black/red interior.  Gas mileage - avg. 28.

The car gets 21 mpg in town and on the highway I set the cruise at 60 and get just a little over 36 mpg. The trunk is large which is good for long extended trips. The interior is well designed and the seating is comfortable. The price was fantastic for such an amazing car,"Large trunk, six CD player, sync, USB port, the three auxillary ports. I also like the rear fold down seats.",The USB port could be in a different location rather then inside the console. There needs to be more interior color choices.

Lots of compliments. Would recommend to 1st time and all other buyers.","The handling, cornering, seat comfort, leg room. The products used for the interior look very nice and well built. Not a cheap looking interior like you find in lots of other cars nowadays.","The SYNC system is horrible. This system doesn't recognize voice commands as well as it should.

We had a great saleman who got us a terrific deal.  We have had our Fusion for almost 3 months and have about 4000 miles on it.....my husband and I are semi retired and we are loving this car. We get 25 mpg in city /31 on the highway. Fun to drive, with precise steering and great brakes. Love the look of the car and the comfort. How did we live without sync?

As fun as the Mustang is, the mpg was a killer in so I needed to find something fun to drive that got much better mileage. The Fusion seemed like a good alternative and after driving it, I was convinced. Although I have essentially half the horsepower of the Mustang, this car makes up for it in handling, the way it drives and substantially better gas mileage. I would recommend the Fusion to anyone that is considering an Accord, Camry or Altima. It looks better than the others and the build quality is as good or better.

5,Fun Car,Chris  ,07/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought a 2008 Fusion in May and have put approximately 2,200 miles on it. Bottom line; it's fun to drive, looks great, has a lot of room for stuff, and gets solid combined gas mileage (around 24 mpg for the V6).  I can't argue at all. And for all the features, it still cost the same as or less than most of the other comparable mid-size sedans. If the quality holds up, it should be a great car for the next couple of years.",The iPod and phone features with the SYNC are great and exterior styling with the sports appearance package. The car also handles extremely well in cornering.,"Manual 6 speed for the V6 (which I would have bought), wider opening rear doors, match GM 100,000 mile warranty...the car should be good for it anyways.

4.875,Impressive given it's import competition,John Cain ,07/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"I came off of a 2005 F150 Supercrew lease and had been looking at several vehicles. They included the Camry, Accord and Sonata. I also looked at the new Taurus. All fine cars. The Taurus is just huge when compared to the rest. I found the Fusion to be well priced given it's features and reviews. It's quiet, well mannered, and generally a pleasure to drive. The gas mileage is better than rated but then again compared to an F150 almost anything car-like is. The old adage of ""have you driven a Ford lately"" really drives home the feeling I get with the Fusion. Try one, you just might like it. ","Quiet cabin, Sync, mileage, and handling.",Perhaps a bit more power from the 4cyl. I think it's coming in 2010 models.

Gas mileage is alright, Im only getting 20.6 MPG but being new and mostly stop and go traffic its to be expected. Other than that its fun to drive (love taking those curves at higher speeds) good build quality, though the black interior needs special care or it will dry out and look dry/sun bleached. Have the sport package and the bigger wheels and suspension makes everyday driving a little harder but its great for the value!

4.875,Nice value.,dambina ,07/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Honestly, we bought our Fusion because it was priced significantly lower than the Camary and Accord. With just over 4K miles, it has exceded all of our expectations. We've averaged over 23 mpg city and 32 mpg highway, which is a bit better than EPA estimates. It drives quite well and handles very well in traffic and on turns. Our family of four just returned from a week long vacation and we were able to fit comfortably inside with all of our stuff!  We've had no problems so far, although SYNC has had bad voice recognition.","We love the Sirius radio (kids love it too), and the display of ""miles to empty"" is nice. The back up assist is great if you parallel park often.","Mileage has been better than advertised, but could be better.   This is Ford's best vehicle. Why not put the best engine in it? If they made a hybrid version, I'd upgrade in an instant. Also, not to be picky, but the receiving end of the seat belt needs to be longer to help put the car seats in."

Though I walked away with only a few bumps & bruises, after seeing the aftermath in the light of day, I decided then and there that I wanted a larger car for my next one.  Wanted to stay with Ford as the Fords I've owned in the past have never given me issues so the Fusion was the logical choice as a ""step up""  Went with the AWD model because the weather up here in Canada tends to vary widely and in Canada only the SEL trim has the AWD option.","The driving dynamics, while not as sharp as the Focus are top notch considering the car's size. The controls are all laid out in a logical fashion for the most part and the SYNC system is a godsend, making using my digital media a snap.","The heating & vent controls are absolutely buried at the bottom of the centre stack.

The Fusion's design, quality, and finish and on par with the competition and a quantum leap from my wife's 04 Mustang. 4-cyl motor and five speed auto trans are a good combination with decent power (25 mpg), and are smoother and quieter than the powertrain of my 06 Honda Element. The chassis delivers a combination of great ride and sharp handling. Highway speeds are quiet, and the sound system delivers subtle symphony notes to my 50 year-old ears at 70 mph!

The ride/handling compromise is just right, and the powerful brakes have excellent pedal feel. The body is solid and is quiet at speed for a mid-priced sedan. I was concerned that the 4 cylinder with automatic would be underpowered, but it revs freely and is just fine for a family car. Plus, the 4 gets respectable mileage and its light weight contributes to the nimble handling. The 5 speed automatic is good.  We shopped Accord, Malibu, and Camry, but the actual selling price for those comparably equipped would have been $5,000 to $6,000 higher!  The Sonata costs a bit more and lacks the sharp handling of the Fusion.","Crisp handling, powerful brakes, generous standard equipment on base car, price.",Bolstered seats may be a bit narrow for many Americans.

And after all the ""test drives"" that I've taken my friends and coworkers on, I'm sure that there will be quite a few more Ford converts in the future.","Handles like it's glued to the road, accelerates wonderfully well for a 4 cylinder car and rides very very smoothly.

The Fusion is excellent the gearbox a delight, the engine so,so flexible, comfort superb, only fault is the special spare which are really useless in rural Canada, we have to cover such vast distances they are impractical at certain times.

With gas prices being what they are, it seemed like the thing to do. I purchased a red Fusion (pretty color), SE package, leather seats, 6- changer CD with a Moon & Tune package.  I'm much happier with the car than I thought I would be. It's roomy, it's comfortable and it's got plenty of power. It's never going feel like a V8, but it's more than I need to get back and forth to work. The Fusion made downsizing bearable without paying the Honda or Accord prices. I got much more for my money than I anticipated.","I like the fact that I got leather seating, a 6-changer CD and a moon roof for much less than I would have paid for other brands.

I have to adjust the seat more than I would like to avoid having my head make contact with the roof. I get around 8 litres/100k on the highway. Most of my city driving has taken place in a Canadian winter and has averaged 11.5 litres/100k, less than the computer showed. Four adults traveled from Canada to Myrtle Beach in comfort.  We all packed light for the trip. The car was useless in snow until I bought snow tires.","I like the message center with the average gas mileage displayed. The moon roof adds to driving pleasure. It handles well, has great styling, especially the front grille and fog lights, a quality sound system, and   a fully adjustable steering wheel. It is well equipped at a reasonable price.","I would like a little more head room. The moon roof takes up a couple of inches. My Focus has traction control but the Fusion does not have it.

I test drove a number of cars on the market, including the Accord and Altima, and came back to the Fusion, as it has a ride very comparable to the Camry, and the interior is much better than the Camry's....much more comfortable.

My opinion is Camry is a lot less dependable car since 2001 and Honda well Honda is a great car but it is steep in price.  Fusion is far and away a great deal for the money.  If I was going to pay $30k for a car I would buy a Maxima and since I paid $20k I got a Fusion.

Some controls feel flimsy and cheap (seat recline lever, light switch, HVAC control, outside door handles) Seats are very comfy and supportive, and as I said they look great with black leather, and black/red cloth inserts.  The engine lacks pick-up, and doesn't seem enthusiastic.  Fuel economy so far (at two weeks ownership) is about 19mpg.  Hope this improves.

This is a quantum leap ahead of the Taurus they issued us i years past. The car feels extremely solid. I corners and accelerates well, and is just plain fun to drive. The hidden gem is the Sync voice activation system.  The voice recognition is nearly flawless. I spend a  lot of time in the car. Being able to have complete control of my iPod and cell phone without taking my hands off the wheel is a huge advantage. ","The Sync system is my favorite feature, hands down. The crisp handling was the biggest surprise.","I'm not crazy about all the exterior chrome. The analog clock on the dash has to much glare, and is hard to read. I wish the seat back was powered like the rest of the seat. A power port in the storage compartment on top of the dash would be useful (I added my own). These are all minor items."
4.875,Ford won me over!,2008 Fusion sport SE ,10/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I test drove 6 cars before making my choice. Mazda 6, Mazda3, Honda Civic Si, Honda Accord, Fusion I4, and Fusion SE V6.  The sport package added to the SE version of the V6 Fusion was absolutely smooth and responsive.  Granted the Accord is a great car, but the '08 version is just to big for my taste.  ",The leather and cloth combination sport interior is by far my favorite aspect of this car. A huge step up from the Civic Si's similar premium cloth interior. Second favorite is the smooth V6. I find myself just cruising along at high speed not realizing that I'm speeding.  ,To make the v6 even better I would like to see some sort of cylinder management system to increase the fuel mileage of the v6 model.  
4.5,Fusion Fan,Fusion Fan ,10/05/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"Have the Fusion for 2 weeks now and I love the car! Great to drive, great to look at. I have the red color which everyone loves!  I'm getting 24MPG in everyday driving with the I-4.  I feel that this engine has plenty of power. Great leg room in front and in the back too! ","Satellite radio, gas mileage, interior space.",More storage area in console.
4.5,Great Commuter Car!,Chris ,10/02/2007,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,4,5,"Had a very bad experience with a Hyundai, traded it in for this Fusion. 4 cyl, 5 speed auto, black on black cloth. The car rides extremely well, offers a controlled but supple ride. The engine has enough grunt to get you from point a to b, I bought it as a commuter car and mileage was my primary concern, so I'm pleased with my 25 mpg city and 30+ highway.  High quality cloth seats, my only gripe is that the door panels don't feel sturdy.  Just hoping it wasn't a complete lemon like my Hyundai was.",Satellite radio is amazing. Love having all hvac and radio controls on the steering wheel. Automatic headlights as well.,"More substantial door inserts and a prettier looking head unit, besides that I'm very pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid handling sedan that looks a little sharper than your average Accord or Camry."
5,2007 Ford Fusion,fusion07 ,09/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love my new car!  I was trying to decide between a Fusion and a Milan when I purchased, but I am very very happy with my choice.  I'm getting 29- 30 on the highway with a V6!  The build quality is great, ride is great!  Awesome job Ford! FoMoCo is back!  Watch out Toyota, Fusion is a sign that Ford will not be denied!","Ride, build quality, performance.","Lower the price of the tires, $227 per tire is way too much!"
5,Initial impressions,Richard ,08/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The I4 is a little ""raspy"" on acceleration but not unduly so.  Seems to have plenty of power even with four very good sized adults.  Roomy and comfortable. The interior really seems exceptionally well thought out. The option did not include the automatic which we did get along with the leather seating which I highly recommend. We have dogs that shed. Seems to be quite roomy both in front and back and I'm over 6'6"" tall.  At highway speeds normal conversations were highly understandable and I thought the handling was great.  No complaints at all. Mileage right on the money at 28 mpg per the window sticker. Getting many compliments based on the light sage color. Styling is excellent.","This car looks good to the eye. I like the location of the gauges, controls,  tilt & telescoping steering wheel.  I had the car the entire day and frankly, couldn't find anything I would change. The 17"" wheels and Michelins really set it off.  But the color is just really eye catching.  Beautiful!",The only true way to suggest improvements would be to drive it many miles and see how it holds up on long trips.  That will tell the tale. 
4.875,Fusion Summary,Arthur on the Bay ,07/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I'm a person who buys a lot of cars to try them out and compare. I've found that the Fusion hits a sweet spot for me with a combination of performance, handling, and economy that's hard to beat. I like to drive hard and the Fusion is very responsive. The inline four winds out nicely, the understeer is predicable, and the brakes are good. Its truly a hoot to push on a country road. Fuel economy in evenly mixed city and highway driving is 23 mpg when pushed and 25 at normal acceleration. The comfort level is high; it's essentially a Mazda6 in American clothes. Only the Accord is better and its slightly higher refinement is not worth the higher price to me.","Steering, handling, engine, and brakes. The 5-speed manual is good, but not as good.  he back seat is roomy for an intermediate. Standard sound system is better than average.  Conti Contact Sport tires are very good. ","Offer a model with a set of shocks and springs that tie it down tighter. Offer a good six-speed gearbox, or at least a better five-speed. I would shrink the whole package five percent in size. Weakest feature is large turning radius."
