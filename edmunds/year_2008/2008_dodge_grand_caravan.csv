Radio looses power then will suddenly come back on after a day or two. Lost 3 qts of oil due to broken  oil pan bolt gasket split,  oil light NEVER came on. I was very excited  to buy a van, I have kept up with oil changes , flushes, recalls, etc at 71 K miles a vehicle should not have these types of problems. I am very disappointed in the reliability of this vehicle, summer vaca is canceled kids disappointed and so am I with wasting money on this vehicle  and letting down my children because I don't feel safe driving long distances due to reliability. I will never buy a dodge again. The only thing good about this vehicle is the room, and storage, However its a waste if its sitting in the drive way.",,

2,A decent van with a lot of problems.,Mark N. ,01/30/2016,3,4,,,,1,4,3,4,,,"108,000 miles and counting.    To start off the Dodge Caravan 2008-2010 model years are plagued with problems.     The keyless entry fobs routinely fail, resulting in expensive reprograming and new key replacement costs.    Putting your key in the ignition and getting a ""BAD KEY"" message while on vacation with a car full of kids will ruin your experience.     Transmission shaft seals,  oil pan seals, AC lines, brake calipers seizing up, undersized brake pads, antifreeze leaks, head gasket seals, and power steering fluid leaks are just a few problems you will have to deal with.    Routine oil changes at 3000 miles or less is a must, do NOT wait for the suggested 5000 mile limit,  the engine will eat upwards of a quart and a half of oil (a problem that plagues many Chrysler/Dodge engines) between oil changes.   Factory tires wear out quickly, tire stores will advise you to buy another brand/model of tire when you replace them.     Recalls stacking up, and the dealerships can't handle the volume of cars coming in,  I've been waiting 6 months for the ignition switch recall alone.What is good about this van?    Well the interior is nicely designed and appointed.   Intuitive controls, with good ergonomics makes this a comfortable ride, and an excellent vehicle for road trips.   Cup holders galore, storage spaces rivaled only by Han Solo's Milennium Falcon, and a sound system that is a pleasure to listen to.   Styling is a high point, but many nooks and bends collect dirt that will have to be cleaned out by hand.     Seats are comfortable, built in child restraints in the second row bench seat is a nice touch.   Performance?      It's a van,  it can merge without much effort, handling is decent but you won't be taking it around the Nurburgring to be sure.    In summary,  I have owned many Dodge products over the years, with cars exceeding 200,000 miles.   This van will be the first time I will trade in a car without at least 150,000 on the odometer.    I really wanted to like this car, and even after $4000 in out of pocket repairs, I thought we could keep it, but the problems never seem to end.     I take great car of my cars,  crawling under them and poking under the hood every week to keep an eye on things and making sure they are well kept.   This is just simply too much of problem child to keep throwing money at it.   Pity,   the Caravan once ruled supreme,  now just a poorly made pale shadow of its former glory.",,

Not just oil but trans fluids also.  If your brakes are going out quick then stop driving like a fool.  The 3.3 and 3.8 are great engines.  Very low maintenance and very easy to service.  Parts are cheap and readily available.  I would have no problem driving mine cross country again. In the last year we have went to Oregon and back, Florida and back and Michigan and back.  We live in Indiana.  It's better if you're mechanically inclined but with regular service the 3.3 and 3.8 have no problem getting to 300,000 miles with a major rebuild.",,

Put in a low coolant sensor. Fix the piston ring gap so it wont burn oil. Dealership says burning 3 quarts in 2k miles is normal?! Not to me!

However, now 4 recalls later and an electrical problem no one can seem to diagnose, I am stuck paying $400/month for a car that has now had 2 sets of brakes and a set of rotors. Overall, I am very displeased with this vehicle. Chrysler, you just set Detroit back 20 years. It's back to the drawing board for you. A new body style doesn't make it a better vehicle.

This vehicle looks good outside, has a decent interior and was exactly what my wife wanted for the family. Chrysler invented the minivan, right? They really screwed together a nice looking piece of poorly engineered crap. Tons of recalls. I have changed the brakes more times in two years than Visa will allow me to speak aloud.  The dealer is finally coming around trying to ""assist"" me with ""my"" problems. Thanks for the help! This is a horrible mistake by this company and should be on the nightly news.  Chrysler won't admit to this failure until someone, or their children, die in an accident. ","This van looks good on the outside and adequate on the inside. Stow and go is great. Kids like the van for room and it has tons of storage for people like us who like to road trip. BUT, its a lemon and we will be pursuing that option shortly. I am not going to ""eat"" Dodge's engineering failures.","Only road trip after you take the brakes to be serviced. Then you may find, as I did, that the rear brakes are smoking on the way home,  less than 1000 miles later.

Rear brakes do 10% of the stopping work.  No reason for rear brakes to be replaced so early.  Absurd.  Chrysler did reimburse me $93 for the brakes (I spent $200 for all 4 brakes).  Had a few trips to the dealership because the A/C didn't blow cold air and the radiator cap was leaking (both recalls).    As far as fuel economy, we averaged 23 MPG on a trip to Boston.

I drive less than 7,500 years and my 1998 BMW 528i was costing $2,500 in annual repairs to achieve this meager goal. The Caravan is fantastic economy and reliability by comparison.","Night lighting is very cool. Stereo is simple to use, great steering wheel controls. I love the pressure monitors. Stow and go seats. Power outlet. Dual glove compartment.","Would love to have high end sound like in my Subaru. The system is good, not great, as is. Add weatherband and better speakers.  The key fob is nice but does not always automaticlly swing back to the right place, and this causes the effect others are seeing in their cars.  Just twist left."
3.5,Not happy at all with this van.,Jules ,10/21/2008,,,4,3,4,3,,4,4,4,2,"I have had nothing but problems with my 2008 Grand Caravan since I got it in Jan. 2008. It has had a new exhaust put on it. The sliding door on the driver's side has been worked on 2 times because it starts to close and then re-opens. That still is not working 100% of the time. The keypad does not work at all when it is near my husband's Tahoe either in the garage or in a store parking lot. Now it beeps at me when I am driving, the lights on the dash all turn on, the RPM and MPH go to 0 & the windshield wipers turn on. I bought it for convenience since I have 3 kids & when the doors don't work or I have to stand there and make sure the doors shut it is anything but convenient.",Not sure at this point,Doors and electrical improvements.

The problem is around the windshield on the unit, Between the window and the pillar that extends to the roof. The rubber insert is not long enough and it causes a whistle sound. You will need to tape the outside until you can run a thin bead of caulk under the rubber to prevent the wind from getting in. I do a lot of driving in a year (42,000 annually) and I currently have it taped and it has stopped the noise. Good luck.",,Improve the rubber insert

We do not have any of the problems that others have mentioned (whistling noise, road noise, poor visibility with dual screens, etc.) The controls are nicely laid out.  Love the Uconnect, mygig, and the 6 speed transmission.  I live on top of a hill, and rather than riding my brakes all the way down, I just downshift and let the engine do the work.  We also love the piece of mind of the lifetime powertrain warranty (we added the lifetime wrap that covers just about everything else for $2700) For under 30k we have tons of features, people / cargo space, power, and safety, with the piece of mind that comes with only having to pay for basic maintenance.

Chrysler sent an inspector out who couldn't find anything wrong. They won't repair damage done to van in collision. They act like it never happened. Beware 08 van owners!

The entertainment system is unsurpassed, with the MyGig System and the rear dual overhead DVD screens.  The exterior styling is more masculine than the competition.  2nd and 3rd rows both still fold underneath, a great feature.  Limited lifetime warranty on the powertrain for the original owner is priceless.  Was about $3,000 to $4,000 less expensive than the Odyssey and Sienna for a comparably equipped vehicle, but those two can't touch the entertainment system.  My wife and I fight over who gets to drive it.  Thus far, we love the Caravan!","The MyGig Entertainment System which allows you to download up to 2,100 songs and acts like a jukebox is awesome!  You can even download pictures for screensavers.  The family group center console, along with the other storage areas, offers a vast array of places to store your ""stuff.""  ","The driver's seat is somewhat stiff and takes a little getting used to.  Not sure how it will be on a long trip.  The combined gas mileage is about what was advertised: 20 mpg.

So disappointed by Dodge by the design, power response, and gas mileage. As owner of 97 Grand Caravan Sport, I can say my 97 handles and get better gas mileage than the 08 model. The Stow-N- Go a plus. Having a handicap child with a wheel chair lots of room is a must. The 08 models lacks space. With my 97, I can place the wheelchair standing up without a problem. With the 08, I had to take it apart.","Power seats, Side door windows roll down, no noise when you drop the windows like it will blow your ears off. Stow N Go, Sport mode, more cup holders, privacy glass, view of the road in front of you. Comfort level.","Exterior design, The caravan is not a lunch box until now.

Over 65 mph and the van sings a tune.  Van been in shop twice and we are still waiting for problem to be fixed.  If we can get rid of this problem, I am sure I will LOVE my new van.

I for one drive about 3-5 miles an hour over the speed limits and have averaged 24-26 on the highway. MY best being most recently a trip to VA where I hit 30 mpg on one tank. I got the 4.0 and must say that the engine is powerful. It's much better than the previous 3.8 that I had in the others.Love the DVD system (great for the grand kids). The VES and Auto Climate manual could be a little more user friendly.  Storage is great. In my opinion the best mini van on the market. Great ride/handling,The dual DVD's.

The front bumper cracked when I drove in single digits over the winter, cracking the bumper.  Ice had stuck to the inside of the bumper and when the ice melted, it dropped, cracking the bumper.  The Paint is also cheap.  My one good kudo is the cargo space.

The comfort was great but the road noise was horrid. You have to have the radio at the #16 volume to hear it. This could have been improved for a few dollars more by Chrysler. The gas mileage is awful! With gas over $3/gallon and maybe $4 by summer it will cost me over $300.00/month (another car payment). Chrysler could have built a more efficient engine than this one.

There was a little more wind noise that I would have liked and it made listening to the poor quality radio difficult (suggest upgrading from the base radio). The gas mileage was OK for a vehicle this size and in this category. I averaged about 22mph with about 80% of the driving interstate. I did not like the keyless entry.

First off, this is one substantial ""mini""van.  Its big, inside and out.  Its quiet on the road, the 4.0L engine puts out plenty of grunt when coupled with the 6 speed auto transmission.  The ability to manually shift the transmission might have some actual uses out there, but for me, its just there to make dad feel like he's driving something a bit more sporty.

Drive it and compare to a Honda if you want a minivan.","mygig option, 25L package, newly designed transmission, turning radius, power sliding doors, power liftgate, fog lights, cup holders, premium sound system, dual dvd screens, heated seats,stow/go seats,spillproof cloth seats,dual glove boxes, automatic locking doors   ","esp/bas/tract lights come on too much, lots of wind noise from roof rack,mygig has confusing menu,no way to change presets for sat option on radio, interior roof height is too low,add a passenger power seat option, 3.8 needs more hp, gas mileage is bad, create a hybrid version, rear window wiper too small"
4.25,Good van,Eduardo Mondragon ,01/08/2008,,,5,3,1,5,,5,5,5,5,"My reference point is my previous 2006 Town & Country. The 2008 Dodge Caravan certainly includes lots of nice features I didn't have in my previous van. Such as the dual DVD system, shades on second and third row windows (optional) and a more ergonomic interior, in general. So far my major complaint is about the quality of the assembly/manufacturing of the body panels. I had a huge gap between the panels of the driver's side doors and the front door (driver's side) has to be slamed or it won't close. After three visits to the dealer the problem has not been fully fixed. The latch system has been replaced and several adjustments have been made. The gap is gone but I still have to slam the door",More ergonomic interiors. Less wind noise than in the previous model.,Improve the quality of your stamping/assembly process.
4.75,What an Upgrade!,STLsparks ,12/18/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,Previously drove a 2004 Grand Caravan and this car blows its doors off.  Terrific improvements in almost every aspect and I can't say enough how much I've enjoyed this car in the first few weeks of ownership.  Tons of compliments from everyone who sees it and we had the choice between the 2008 Grand caravan and the 2007 Odyssey LX (for about the same price) and to us it was no contest.  4.0 engine is a nice upgrade and they made the ride much more car-like (and quieter) compared to our prior Caravan.  ,"Navigation and entertainment system. Smoother and quieter power sliding doors. Interior lighting, Bluetooth, running boards (at first I didn't want them but they were already installed on the car I wanted and they make the van look a lot sportier - and make it easier for the kids to get in the car)",Incorporate the trip info into the Entertainment screen (very awkward to reach behind the steering wheel).  Improve the quality of DVD/TV screen 
4.875,Fantabulous,Roy ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Fourth Chrysler product. Intrepid, 300M Pacifica and now the Grand Caravan.  Only the 300M was better, as it is a car and meant for comfort and style. Grand Caravan is a joy to drive.  Backup camera, ambiant lighting, all interior doors side lighting and stow and go are great features.  CD/radio great sound and easy to download CDs. Did not get video system, no small children anymore. Bluetooth makes cell phone calling and answering easy and you do not have to hold a phone in your hand, thus driving safely. Fantastic vehicle","Backup camera, bluetooth calling and radio CD player.",
4.75,First minivan,6979 ,11/28/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,5,5,First minivan and love it have owned suvs and cars. This is the best vehicle so far. Great with backseat TV for the kids,Kids watch TV and don't fight,Better fit and finish. Center console feels like it's gonna break
5,Perfect fit,mstbc5 ,11/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is our first Dodge Caravan, previously owned three Chrysler T&C. Local dealer only sells Dodge. We wanted the stow-n-go seats which suits our constant hauling items to our kids who live out of state, all three in three different states. After unloading we simply fold up seats to haul parents and child seats. We are very happy with the new exterior styling and interior creature comforts -  heated seats, adjustable pedals, rear camera, second windows that open! Very comfortable for highway driving.","Heated seats, adjustable pedals, Sirius radio, 3.8 engine, auto headlights, hands free communication.",Have to wait and see. No immediate needs
4.75,Comfort and safety at an affordable price,Chuck ,11/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Present mileage just shy of 4000.  Gas mileage city 15 and 24 highway.  Best ride of any mini-van I have driven.  Wish I had paid a few dollars more and got the SXT.  Traded in a 2007 Mercury Milan that I really liked, but this mini is a whole lot more vehicle and gets almost the same gas mileage",The handling and the ride. That's what its all about.,All transmissions should be 5 or 6 speeds.
2.75,Nice at a glance-  but look further,pete ,10/31/2007,,,4,4,1,1,,3,2,3,4,"At first glance, it's a lot of van for the money.  I was most impressed with the Entertainment option.  However, I had the van for 3 days and returned it.  In 3 days of driving, the 3rd row video screen stopped working 2x, the pass sliding door would not close 5x (closed, then opened), overhead console rattles, remote for the DVD didn't work, music copy function didn't work on the radio, and the exterior panels are not even.  Look at the gap between the hood and fenders.  This van has a lot of nice features - a lot of features that will keep you coming in for service of intermittent problems  Also, the van w swivel seats is not crash test rated, but others are 5 star. HMMMM",Ability to play 2 DVD's simulataneously and listen to the radio. Ability to purchase the entertainment system without purchasing all the options you don;t want. Backup camera.,Improve video quality on screens.  For over $2000 the picture quality is terrible. Bring back the integrated child seats.  You can't get to the 3rd row with 2 car seats in the middle. Improve the fit and finish and stop using the cheapest feeling plastic made. Improve reliability of electronics.
5,Awesome,benneyoboy ,10/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car was such a good and cool car, I love it. I have a big family and this car fits my family just right. Wow this car is such a good car. I the seats have such a great design and my kids can play cards and be happy on longs trip because of the great room. This car is the only car that i have had fits all my groceries in. I am writing this review about this car because it is as awesome car, very safe, and with the lifetime warranty, I love this car it will last.",The seats and how they move,"This car could be a litter cheaper, but it is worth the price."
4.875,Our first Chrysler/Dodge,Our first chrysler ,10/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is our first minivan and our first Chrysler/Dodge vehicle. We had looked at the other makes and models and found that the Dodge Caravan and it's counterpart are by far the best minivans around.  Very sharp vehicle. I have had it only one week and absolutely love it!  We have two small children with a third on the way, and it is very comfortable and fun to drive. (SXT, 4.0L 255 hp, 28N package with NAV) Awesome! My next car will likely be a Chrysler product - They have thoroughly impressed me. I went from a Volvo S60R to a minivan, and I don't miss my Volvo sports car at all! I never thought that a minivan could be fun.","Standard lifetime powertrain warranty, Entertainment features/options, great looks, comfort, swivel and go, power doors and lift gate, DVDs, etc.  No minivan stigma. Rearview camera.",Interior materials could be a bit richer and seats could be a bit more plush. Nothing that should deter anyone from buying the best minivan available at the present time.
5,Dodge got it right!,Brian ,09/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Just bought this van and I am impressed already. This redesigned 08 looks sharp and has all the features you could want without the mark-ups you get from Honda and the other guys. We got the 28N package which puts you into the 4.0L V- 6 at 255hp (Plenty of power on the highway plus more than all of the competition). Inside is great with two DVD screens and the swivel and go seating.  Power doors and lift gate make this grocery getter easy to love. Dads don't worry about the minivan stigma because this thing looks and drives great.,"Redesigned look, 255hp V-6, rear DVD system.",Nothing at this time!
4.5,Dodge Grand Caravan SE,thats a dodge! ,08/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,4,4,"This is a very sharp minivan. I've had it for a week so far and my wife and I love it! Im not impressed too much with the acceleration too much when passing, but the engine still has to break in. I researched the 0 to60 for this van and it was over 10sec",Shape and reliability from a Dodge,Increase hp on 3.3 engine
