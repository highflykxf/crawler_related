I only have 56k miles on it, and have had many electrical issues, some of which have made the car unusable. The dealer service is expensive and incompetent. The car itself, when it works, is pleasant enough, but is totally unreliable. No wonder GM went broke making rubbish like this.Update: my local independent mechanic has repaired most of the electrical issues, and apart from minor issues which appear and then apparently fix themselves, the car is now relatively reliable.",,

I usually have traction control OFF when it is nice weather outside, because it comes on too much to be helpful in summer.
In winter or during rainstorms it is helpful, but not when it's nice weather, in my experience.
Everyone has their own preferences, though.

It's a little expensive to fix/maintain.
I bought mine Certified Used, so some things are still under warranty, but this car costs over twice as much to fix as many other GM cars, due to high tech/luxury features.

Centerpoint is the setting to use. The other four settings make the system sound awful at high volumes.

I am in my mid 40's and looked at Lexus, Infiniti, MB.  The caddy, for the price, exceeded those other car makers.

So far this car is solid in all respects; handles well,comfortable, reliable, good mileage and is fast enough. In my opinion, this car favorably competes with BMW, MB and the other usual suspects but after you negotiate your final price, there really is no comparison becuse you pay a lot less. The status of a label is unimportant to me (although a Caddy still has some clout left) and as car enthusiast, I look to the raw driving experience.

Its the best oem sound system I've ever heard, by the way I am a musician. Of course the mileage is so so I bought the v8. Funny that the hid light are not std for that car.

I traded in my 2005 STS, and got a great deal on the purchase.  To this point, I am very pleased with the car, although gas mileage has not been good.  Hopefully, it will get batter as I put more miles on the car.  Although my 2008 is still very new,I believe it is a big improvement over the 2005.  The car looks and rides better.

At 250 miles we took off to Florida from Ohio and averaged 24 mpg at 68 mph.  Many times I took it above 75.  The six speed transmission feels almost continuously variable.  We purchased the navigation option along with the luxury interior package and AWD.  I agree 18"" wheels would have been nice but the HD brakes are not compatible with this larger wheel.  The car performance is smooth and controllable compared to the BMW 535 and the Mercedes E Series. We  test drove the CTS and agree with other reviewer that there is no comparison .

We did have a problem when pulling over on the highway to change drivers. A rain- filled pot-hole crumpled the front end, not noticeable on the outside.  A simple call to OnStar led us to the nearest dealer. The only option we did not get was the navigation system, & I'm fine with that!

They want to sell you a CTS at sticker b/c they make more $ on them, but the STS is worth the extra money, it is much more car.  Smooth, quiet, luxurious. This is quite simply a nicer car than the  5- series BMW and E-Class Mercedes without the price tag of the BMW or the poor quality of the Mercedes.  I could not tell the difference in performance test driving the V-8 and V-6.  The DI V6 feels like a V-8.  This car simply babies you.

Why on earth does Cadillac not allow the buyer to order a V-6 in all-wheel drive with 18"" wheels and driver awareness options, while allowing this on the V-8?

Incidentally, there isn't even any dedicated 2008 STS Forum on Edmunds yet!

That is not to say anything bad about the '03, just that Cadillac got it right with this one. RWD, IMHO, is a much better way to design and build this class of car. I got the car pretty much loaded up.  Sticker was ~$54K. The larger 18"" wheels included in the 1SC Luxury Performance package, along with the HD brakes really make this a driving machine.
