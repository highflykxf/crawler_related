Traveling in the rain and snow is a complete hassle. Aside from lack of power, I haven't had problems with trans, engine or drive train. However the exhaust heat shield rattles after one month of ownership. The electronics are lackluster, being just windows and a radio, but the drive side is automatic so that's a bonus. The fuel economy is good but not great, considering the size, I don't have an exact estimate but I top it off every week and a half with a relatively short commute. Storage is okay, nothing spectacular, I moved with this car but I only had a bedroom's worth of furniture, on a side note the hatchbacks lift broke within a week of owning it.    In summary, this car will do but there are tons of better car in the used market, definitely look elsewhere especially with Honda civic/accord, Toyota corolla/camry, ford focus, and other nissans like the sentra.",,

3,Nissa does not care about customer safety,Bill Fitzgerald ,04/26/2016,4,2,2,,,4,1,3,3,,,"2 years ago my passenger side front wheel fell off the wheel support structure. I was traveling 25mph and the car abruptly stopped dead in it's tracks, no rolling to a stop or skidding. 10 minutes later I would have been traveling 65mph heading to work & can imagine the potential for damage, injury, loss of life. The repair bill was $388. I contacted Nissan and requested that they reimburse me, after all this is a defect, wheels do not fall off. Nissan declined. In Jan 2016 I received a recall notice from Nissan indicating the the front wheel springs needed to be replaced because they were susceptible to corrosion due to the winter weather in the north east. The corrosion could cause the springs to fail and the wheel would fall off. I had Nissan replace the springs and sent them a letter with the $388 repair bill from 2014. After all, Nissan just admitted that the front wheels could fall off at any time! Nissan declined to pick up the tab for their wheel defect. During my conversation with the Nissan representative, I told them that Nissan does not care about customer safety.  Nissan's refusal to reimburse me for the wheel structure defect repair enforces the point that Nissan does not care about customer safety. Any company which cared about customer safety would recognize their wheel structure defect and immediately take care of it. How many other unsuspecting Nissan owners are driving around in a vehicle in which the wheel could fall off at any time! Nissan does not care about customer safety!",,

Combined mileage is 29.  The car handles snow and ice very well.  The car is comfortable with minimal road noise.  The only thing about the car we don't like is the ventilation.

Mine got poorer than average MPG despite a light foot.  The brakes squeaked from the first day and were never repaired to my satisfaction. Nissan even distributed a note to dealerships to excuse themselves from this problem. In other words: Versas squeak. Too bad.  If you want a low cost Nissan, buy the Cube instead.","The rear door design makes for easy access to the roomy back seat. The styling is conventional, but that's a good thing. Not everyone wants a small car to look tricked-out.",Better suspension is needed badly. Offer the CVT in a lower priced package. Redesign the door armrests to be less intrusive into the cabin.

This car was purchased to be a daily driver as the CRX is modified and I was attempting to keep low miles on it.

So far in the less than 12 month of owning it the fuel pump has been replace 2x, the starter has been replaced 1x and still won't turn over reliably, the tranny has been rebuild 1x, the a/c blower has been replaced 1x, the cd unit has been replaced 1x, and I'm sure I've forgotten a few.

5,Pleasant Surprise,MrIcemaker ,06/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I originally purchased this vehicle as a means to lower my fuel costs  my main vehicle was an F-350 diesel, and I commute 70 miles each day.  In 18 months I would then turn it over to my daughter to drive.  Since February, I have put just short of 9000 miles on the car (will put about 20,000 per year I am guessing), including a 16 hour (each way) trip to Reno NV (from Denver) without overnighting.  That is a long time in a car, and I was surprised how comfortable it was.  Plenty of power, excellent handling, and I averaged over 35 mpg on the trip at 75 mph set on the cruise control.  I would not only recommend this car, I may buy another one in 18 months and keep this one for myself! ","Roomy comfortable driver's seat (I am 6'3, 210# and have plenty of room).  Surprising large interior (deceptively so). Great handling, and excellent power for a small vehicle.  Front wheel drive also did well in the snow.","I miss not having a right side arm rest for the driver.  Also, there are no interior map lights - only a dome light that illuminates the entire interior."

One thing that I love about this car is the comfort; from the front seats to the back! With the high price of gas, it doesn't hurt my pocket as much!",I love everything  about the Versa!,
4.125,Decent Car,Decent Car ,06/08/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,4,4,"I generally look at a number of things prior to buying a new car.  The Versa was the best combination of price and features that I found.  The Versa transmission (6 speed) is smooth and easy to use.  The final drive ratio should be about 300 rpm lower at 70 mph. I am not sure what possessed Nissan when they designed this.  I agree, the center armrest is needed. I ordered one in and added it myself.  I am getting mileage from 31 -38.  I am a conserative steady drive.  Nice car in general, doesn't attract attention.",Comfortable highway ride.  Roominess.,Change the final gear ratio to improve gas mileage. 
4.375,2008 Versa,jgonzales ,06/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,3,4,4,4,I've had the car less than a month. I really like the interior room. The power of this car is satisfactory. There is plenty of room for the kids in the back. I wish it would get at least 35 mpg on the highway. ,The interior room is great. I think the stereo system is more than enough.,Better gas mileage. Standard equipment should always include cruise control and arm rests.
5,2008 Nissan Versa... what a cool car!,Jan Hill ,06/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great car. I drove the Honda Fit, the Toyota Yaris, the Suzuki SX4, and the Nissan Versa won hands down. It's a great car. Has a lot of interior room. The Versa has tons of room and I can straighten my leg all the way out, which is great when you are commuting 2 hours round trip a day. The mileage is great. I'm getting 33 MPG and It's not even broken in yet. Very quiet ride (w/windows closed) and does great at highway speeds of 70 MPH. It feels stable and solid. Has a big car feel to it. The others felt like scary go-carts at high speeds.",My favorite feature is the cruise control.  Wouldn't buy a car without it.  Also like the way the cruise is set up on the stearing wheel. Very easy to access.  The car also has great pick up.  It has quite a surprising amount of power for a small gas efficient car.,Very noisy with the windows down.  Can't leave both rear windows all the way down or your ear drums get blown out.  It creates a type of baffle sound in the back of the hatchback.

5,Great Little Car!!,Dave ,06/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've driven the Fit, Scions, Focus, Corolla, Yaris and Civic and I have to say that I like the Versa the best.  The Corolla, Yaris and Civic all are well made cars, but for me the Versa had the smoothest ride/acceleration (CVT) and best interior.  The layout of the controls was top notch.  Also you sit up higher in the seat so you have a better view of what's up ahead.  The keyless feature seemed like no big deal at first, but when your hands are full, you don't need to fumble in your pockets for the key.  It's a pretty neat feature.  However, what people like is so personal to them that I think you need to drive all the aforementioned cars to decide what is right for you.  Good luck!!","CVT, no-key entry and locking, good seats, 6 disc CD, interior layout and better stock radio than others.","Tilt-telescopic steering (best to test the wheel before buying; was OK for me), daytime running lights, disc brakes on top line model."
4.625,"Easy Transition, Maxima to Versa",S Boyle ,06/01/2008,,,4,5,5,4,,4,5,5,5,"Driving the Versa made it easy to economize and transition from an 04' Maxima SL in both cost and comfort.   I wanted a more fuel efficient car and spent weeks researching the Honda Civic/Fit, Toyota Corolla, Nissan Senta/Versa, Chevrolet Aveo, and Ford Focus. After test driving the Civic, Focus, Corolla and Sentra, I chose Versa with ABS.  It's amazingly peppy with easy steering and great turning radius. It offers the most room of any of cars I drove and is just as comfortable as the Maxima. There is plenty of rear room for grandchildren's car seats without adjusting front seats.  The difference in the payments, gas costs and insurance saves me nearly $4,000 over the next 20 months.",Maneuverability. comfort and fuel economy.  I averaged 25.5 in the Maxima and now 34.6 with the Versa. ,The safety feature of the tire pressure monitor is a great idea.  It is very sensitive. I had my car back to the shop the second day when tires were 3 lbs under pressure in all four tires. Dealers should check pressure before selling to customer and also alert customers of TPM sensitivity.
4.75,Best Hatch for My Cash,jasonnwin ,05/31/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"So far, I love the car.  It's onyx blue with beige interior.  It had about 16 miles on the odometer.  I've put about 300 miles on it driving to and back from work on the freeway.  Feels very upscale for an ""econo-class"" car.  I chose the Versa after test driving three different versions (Manual, Auto, and Sports Auto with paddle shifter) of the Honda Fit.  I found the Fit nimble but has too much of an ""econo-car"" feel to it.  Plus the CVT and the Inteligent Key on the Versa are a couple of the many awesome ""upscale"" things that I appreciate every time I drive my Versa.  I couldn't ask for more for the price that Nissan is selling it for.","CVT all the way, Inteligent Key, Bluetooth, 6-disk mp3 cd player + aux input for other mp3 players, 15"" rims, lots of room, big comfortable seats, gas efficient.","Less noise while driving at low speed.  Doors I don't have to slam to close all the way.  Since I don't need a key to get in and start the car, the inteligent key doesn't need to be but half the size it is right now."
4.375,Versa Info,Bruce ,05/30/2008,,,5,4,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"At 6'4"" & 240 lbs, I actually fit in the Versa. The seat is a bit short for my long legs & not quite wide enough to accomodate my wide hips. My wife is 6' & the seats fit her fine. You can haul 2 six footers in the back without them feeling cramped. The Versa handles fine but the suspension is a bit choppy on rough roads. The Versa feels underbraked but I've been driving 1 ton & 3/4 ton trucks for 25 years so I am used to strong brakes. My first tank of fuel in all city driving yielded 27 mpg. At 2,000+ miles I am up to 29 mpg in the city. On a recent trip with a 700 lb payload & running 75 mph, I averaged 31.5 mpg. Versa's my first compact car & I would buy another. Lots of room for a compact!!","The SL has all the bells & whistles. The front & rear windows de-fog fast, power windows, door locks & even power mirrors. The CVT is quite nice, no tranny shifts & enough zip to merge on to a fast moving freeway.",Stronger brakes & a wider & longer seat pan. Versa needs window deflectors as water on the roof will run right on to your inside door. 
5,Versa's ROCK!!,Jennifer Webb ,05/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have driven many, many vehicles. The Versa is a perfectly balanced car. You get a lot of bang for your buck, plus my family of four fits comfortably. The styling is cute, particularly with the rear spoiler (hatchback). Gas mileage is great. I was driving a Jeep Cherokee and that thing was killing my wallet. The Versa also sits so that I don't feel too low to the pavement. There is great visibility. Even though from the outside it looks small, it doesn't feel small on the inside. The body lines are like the Quest minivan, but I'm too cool to drive one of those. :) There are two other people in my family that have Versas and I think that everyone should. You should test drive today!","Intelligent key, hands down.",N/A
4.5,Versa works for me,Paul ,05/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"I test drove the Honda Fit and Nissan Versa numerous times before making up my mind.  I chose the Versa and I am extremely happy that I did. It feels substantial, looks good and the CVT, Intelli key and Blue tooth hands free are awesome. The trunk is small but the ride is smooth and quiet. The engine tends to ""lug"" a bit when cruising around 30 mph but smooths out quickly when gas is applied. The engine sound is ""buzzy"" during quick accelerations but quiets right down.  MPG so far is 26.44 but that is strictly around town driving (hardly ever over 50). Overall so far, I love it.

I mostly use my Versa as a daily commuter in stop & go suburban rush hour traffic and get about 28 mpg. I just took it on its first 200 mile trip up and down the Berkshire Mountains of Ma on a major highway and was more than pleased to see that I got 36 mpg with cruise set @ 72 mph with the 6M. The ride was comfortable and quiet although the narrow, tall stature of this car causes crosswinds to play with it a little bit. Nothing terrible though. I still miss not having a center console. The only annoyance I had was the low pressure tire sensors misbehaving in the extreme cold. No problems though. Still love it!","A lot for a little, room, smooth/quiet/comfortable for a car of this class, good mileage for a large-little car. Much better than expected highway mileage. Good in snow especially stopping (without abs). Everything else still holds true from my first review. This is a great car!",Large rear passenger corner blind spot because of the large rear pillars (takes getting used to). Still dislike the lack of a center armrest especially on the 6 manual trans. First gear is a bit small and the whole gearing could be moved up a bit. These are just some small annoyances though.

I wanted a no-frills, simple car, and the Versa was that plus a bit more.  I was also looking for something to carry around people comfortably, and the Versa does just the trick; I even find myself wanting to sit in the back seat to indulge in all the room. The interior layout and controls are nice, everything I need while driving is within easy reach.  Performance-wise, the Versa meets my needs. I have to keep reminding myself it's not a sports car, but with some consideration on my part, it does what I need it to do. Street and highway driving are a breeze. Fuel economy is decent.","Seating: As I mentioned already quite comfortable and plentiful.  I also like the abundance of air bags, makes me feel just a bit safer driving around.  The A/C cools quickly enough (I live in the desert).

The fact that it drives and feels nothing like an economy car is icing on the cake.The interior is amazingly roomy and comfortable for a small car and a lot quieter than I expected, almost a Mausoleum compared to my old Neon.

5,Great Car and Fun To Drive 2008 with CVT,Josh77 ,04/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased my versa in on March 12, 08 and had an issue with the brakes rotors needing to be turned due to vibrations.

Thought it was bad gasoline but ended up being Fuel Pressure Sensor. Just had that repaired and continue to enjoy this car. Getting 30-32mpg consistently. The CVT takes some getting use to but the selling point was no maint. for 150K miles or more. Lots of interior room but black seats show lots of dirt when you have kids.  Needs more 12 volt outlets.

The CVT is the best transmission I've ever driven; it is smooth.  If you drive the Versa with a light foot, it keeps the engine RPMs down below 2000 and makes for a quiet car and gas mileage of 30+.  The back seat of this car is the real highlight.  Being 6' 2"", I can drive the car and still have 2 happy adults in the back seat.  Nissan clearly traded off some luggage room for a larger back seat.  The Bluetooth phone feature works perfectly with my Blackberry.  It pairs automatically.

The seats are large and solid and nicely upholstered.  Interior looks expensive like a Maxima, way better than our Echo's plasto box interior.

Very quiet inside, not much wind noise etc. It's a bit sloppy on the road in high winds, but descent in the snow. Why is there no temperature gauge?? Come on Nissan! Alternator and most major parts are easily replaceable under the hood for those who plan to own for a long time!","I think the seats are best in class, give excellent support on longer drives. Steering is nicely weighted to give some feedback on what the tires are doing. Back seat space is outstanding. I'm 6'3"" 245lbs and can fit with room to spare. It's more of a two place rear seat, not a three.","Cruise control as an option on the S trim level. Washer fluid doesn't like to 'fan spray' over the windshield which makes it difficult to clean when the fluid only squirts up 5-6"". The 26"" wiper blade is hard to find (winter version would be good to get!). "
4.5,Great Car,wsnyderco ,02/12/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"Haven't had my Versa for very long, but I have not complaints so far. It handles well, fuel economy is great, and its a very good looking car. My car is a 2008 Nissan Versa S hatchback 6 speed manual. The price and look brought me to this car and I am happy I found it.","Price, look, and reliability.",Only thing I wish I could change would be the color. I chose white and wish I would have went with something else. 
3.75,"OK, A Little Disappointed",Ryan ,02/09/2008,,,4,4,3,4,,4,3,4,4,"After copious research I narrowed it down to Honda Fit or Versa, better dealer financing swung it in favor of the Versa. After a month, though, I'm a little hesitant to recommend this little hatchback. Gas mileage has been OK, but not great we've got 21s to 29 depending on how much highway driving we do (this is the CVT model). Driving comfort is the big problem, lumbar support is non-existent, seats are short and no support under thighs. Steering wheel is too far away if you're not ridiculously short. Ride is OK but blows around like a leaf in the wind and doesn't feel well connected to the road (easily drifts). That said, it turned out to be excellent in snow, easy to control and stop.","Intelligent Key is way cool. Upholstery quality. Quiet as long as you're not accelerating. Very good sized interior, especially the superb back seat. Dash is attractively simple. Controls are simple. Convenience Package is well worth it. Usable cupholders galore. Big, deep glove-box.","Seats need to be much more supportive, hurts my back to drive. Chintzy and oddly placed seat levers. Plastics scratch easily/look cheap. Parking break tends to not snap down all the way. Seats should fold flat with trunk, maybe a fold down door to cover recessed space if wanted. Better handling."
4.5,2008 Nissan Versa,bomart ,02/05/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"I test drove the Yaris, Fit, Focus, and the Scion xD. The Versa was not the best driving car, too much oversteer on turns, felt top heavy, and uneven braking, but I felt it was the best value. My 2002 Focus SE handles much better, and gets about the same 30-34 MPG. The 1.8L CVT has better acceleration than my 2.2L Focus, but is noisy at higher RPMs. What sold me on the Versa was its upscale stock interior styling and the roomy back seat. I found only 2 manufacturing defects, a squeak coming from the dash, and the chrome plating on the front Nissan emblem peeling (dealer replaced). Not bad compared to the many defects I found in my Ford Focus when purchased new.  ","Roomy backseat, 6 CD stock changer, largest trunk area with seats down in it's class, good insurance rating, standard side air bags, comfortable driving position.","Needs lighted cruise contol buttons, side mirror controls should be higher, with 4 people in car very little trunk room space for luggage, needs stiffer suspension and more precise steering, improve MPG, back window could be a bit larger, improve braking, awkward audio controls."

I also drove the mid-level Sentra and the Versa has a much better interior layout. LOVE my bluetooth phone and intelligent key. As a small business owner, this feature is a lifesaver and worth every cent! The ABS upgrade has also paid for itself with a $300 per six months savings on my car insurance over the old Sentra. Car is peppy and ROOMY.. almost like the fabled Tardis.. way bigger inside than it looks! I plan to drive this car for 10 years and think it will be a happy love affair.

Handled very well on the snow and ice, very impressed with the quietness, in fact just yesterday a passenger in my car didn't believe the engine was still running 'til I pulled away!! Half a tank of gas will see me over 200 miles (driv to work is 30 miles highway 15 miles city).

What a differance color really does make. The 07 was black, didn't have all the amenities that my husband wanted, so we traded it in for an 08. This one is white, just what he wanted with the sunroof, xm radio, and all the additional pkgs. you can get. Life is too short, might as well get what he really wants.

The car rides and responds like a much bigger car.  They could have placed the side mirror controls in a better location so that you do not have to bend and reach to make adjustments.  Other than that, my wife and I really enjoy driving this car.",Keyless entry.,Make the mirror adjustment easier to reach. 
4.875,Rural Colorado,rural Colorado ,12/24/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Test drove the CVT, my 6 speed is much more responsive and quiet. Fuel economy is great at 32 city-35 hwy. Drove a lot in Denver recently- consistent 32 mpg. Very happy with the options chosen with the S (cruise, power package), and equally happy with the price. Test drove Corolla and Civic. The Versa and the options I wanted would have cost me much more in the other (more well known) models. Insurance is also cheaper! The Versa is much more comfortable and fun to drive. Wish there was an arm rest... small price to pay. A lot of space in such a small sedan. Handles well on ice and snow. Great car!     ","Fuel economy, cruise controls on steering wheel, pricing, comfort, space.  ","Would have liked the rear seat to fold down like those in the hatchback version. Also, a center arm rest, lighted cruise control buttons, and a driver side vanity mirror. Still some bugs to be worked out of the tire pressure sensors (cold affects them).    "
4.5,3 Month Review,Patrick ,12/18/2007,,,5,4,4,5,,4,5,4,5,"After 3 months, I continue to be very happy with the Versa.  I enjoy the extras (MP3 plug-in, etc.), but the basics of the car are great (ie: automatic tire pressure warning). I get 25-30 mpg depending if I have been using the AC. No problems driving in the recent snow. It's no sportscar, but I definitely notice good pick-up off the lights compared to almost all other sedans on the road. Overall, a great value. ","MP3 plug-in, built-in XM radio, mesh-like upholstery, plenty of head room, backseat has lots of leg room.",Heat takes a few minutes when it's really cold.
4.875,Best Car for the $$$,Kim ,12/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After owning my fair share of Honda Civics, I decided it was time for a change.  I wanted something that was good on gas and comfortable at a price that wouldn't break the bank.  I test drove a Mazda3, Ford Focus & Hyundai Elantra before settling on the Versa. I'm 100% satisfied with my decision.  While an ""economy"" car, the Versa SL doesn't lack in quality.  The quality of the interior fabric is superb.  It's easy to clean & durable.  All controls are placed logically & are easily accessible.  The CVT is smooth and quiet. Love it!","Convenience Pkg w/ Bluetooth Technology, so no need to dig through your purse or pockets for your keys or cellphone PLUS audio controls mounted on steering wheel; fold down arm rest w/ cupholders in back seat (unusual for a car in this class) ; 6-disc changer standard on SL; great legroom throughout.","Driver's armrest (SL) is placed too low, so some driving comfort is lost.  ABS is not standard. Larger center console would have been nice."
3.75,Nissan with a lot of electrical problems!,rizeabove ,12/16/2007,,,4,5,1,1,,5,5,5,4,"TPMS replaced new computer for sensors. Hit door locks and occasionally the stereo cuts off.

Gas door jammed and bent from wind rushing behind it now I have to use a credit card to open sometimes! I have 25000 miles on car. It is a 6 speed and occasionally on steep grades inclines or descending the car will make rattling noises and Ill feel slight vibration in clutch.

5,5th Nissan - this could be the best one!,rick752 ,12/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Own this for 2 months. This car has a great ""French"" ride similar to an old Renault R-10 I used to own... nice! The 6 speed shifts terrific but the gearing and clutch take a little getting used to. Seats are very comfortable. Controls for major functions are nicely laid out and instrument panel is well lit.  This car rides very smooth and quiet for its class, and the price can't be beat for the features. Seating room front & back is MUCH larger than most compact cars. The hatch's 'trunk' is deceivingly large. I love the looks of the car except for the nose... looks like a tiny, Quest van. Gas mileage in mostly stop & go, suburban rush hour traffic is about 28 so far. I really like it :-)","Extremely quiet & smooth ride. Large versatile interior space & legroom front & back. Large hatchback 'trunk' area. Decent gas mileage vs size & ride comfort. Dashboard lighting & ease of dash controls. Keyless entry w/alarm, tilt, cruise, AC, PW, PL, PM, decent stock CD, side airbags for under $15k","This is the first Nissan that I owned that didn't have a center console armrest. It would be nice to include one at least with the 6 speed. Besides that, this is a great effort by Nissan. If this is anything like my past Nissans, it should hold up well."
4.5,Good buy for the money,John ,12/09/2007,,,4,4,4,5,,5,4,5,5,"Having purchased the Versa three weeks ago, I have to say I am impressed. Having to commute 72 mi a day, I am getting 30 miles to the gallon. My vehicle now has 800 miles on it. Having a manual, and owning three prior autos with manual transmission including Toyota Corolla, I have to say that for the price, the Versa is well worth it. The only drawback which I am getting used to is in regards to shifting. There is very little room for error in shifting from second to third as well as from fifth to fourth gear. There is plenty of headroom in the drivers seat as well as plenty of room in the rear. If you're looking for a reduced priced subcompact. I would recommend the Versa over the Corolla.

Only those from Toyota and Honda drove as nice. That said, the automatic is a little clunky (I should have gotten the stick or the CV tranny!) Gas mileage is very disappointing, I drive all highway miles and struggle to get 28 mpgs.","Versa was the best price and the best fit. I am 6'2"" and this is the most comfortable car I have ever driven.  I drive 2 hours a day and still enjoy sitting in this car!",Whatever Nissan has to do to get the gas mileage up into the mid 30s (like they claim) they should do it.

4.875,Feedback,Aubrey ,11/26/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Have owned my 2008 hatchback for almost 2 months. Drives great and lots of room. I trust Nissan and know they make excellent cars. So far there are 3 undesirable issues. One is that the wheels have very cheap hub caps. One of mine came flying off while I was driving. It's a piece of junk these covers! Also the cup holders are in a horrible location. I had to install a cup tray (from a conversion van) on the dash in the middle. And finally do not buy this car without the power option. A huge mistake. Power locks should be standard but they are not. You will regret it w/o the power package.   ,"Price, performance, gas mileage, head room.",No plastic hub caps. Better cup holders.
5,Excellent Value,Bob Browne ,11/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Versa S sedan, manual trans, with the Power Package is more than enough car for our family of young drivers. The car shifts smoothly, rides nice for a small car, and has much more interior leg room in the back seat than many mid size cars. The trunk space is surprisingly large too. The dash has a nice look. I believe this vehicle will gain a lot of sales momentum as it priced so competitively and has so much to offer. ",My car has no fancy features.

Yup, it's no pocket rocket, but the CVT gets it up to speed sooner than you can tell ""Bluetooth"" which number you wish to dial. The ride is smooth with good road feedback. Quieter than other more expensive vehicles. I've had my share of Porsches, Corvettes, and everything in between. Nissan has put some serious thought into the making of this vehicle, and what it has to offer. The Versa proves that an inexpensive car doesn't have to be made cheaply. With ridiculous gas prices these days, I'd buy it again.   ",Comfortable interior. Bluetooth and cruise controls on steering wheel. Keyless ignition. Great dash. Nicely appointed interior. Quiet ride.,Front end styling. Better slalom suspension. A bit more power. (Isn't that always a given??).

4.875,Great Car for the Money,honest_reviewer ,10/08/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,5,5,"Overall, a great car. Nice appearance  both the exterior and interior.  The interior has a nice futuristic feel to it (not over the top) and is exceptionally spacious (back seat okay for adults).  Mixed fuel economy has returned an impressive 30  33 mpg (albeit mostly highway).  The CVT is wonderful  it offers seamless shifting (Ill never settle for a conventional automatic again).  Ample acceleration (no sports car however).  Great features for an ""entry-level"". Why buy an SUV, like the Honda CR-V my wife and I traded in, when you can have effectively the same interior space, much better fuel economy, in a less expensive package?

We love the style of the car, the inside is comfy, CVT is great, audio system is wonderful, and bluetooth is a great safety feature.
