5,Excellent car!,Sunny ,07/06/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,This my 4th Hyundai Elantra.  I bought 4 new Elantras so far.  The only reason I bought a new Elantra was scratches on body here and there.  This never disappointed me.  Overall aspects of this car's performance is just excellent!,,
5,Pleasantly Satisfying Period of Ownership,FB ,02/28/2016,5,4,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,"I bought this car in April 2008, as my everyday car for school and life. I compared it to the 2008 Honda Civic LX that my cousin had as well as a 2008 Toyota Corolla S that another friend had and for the value and amenities offered on this car, it was excellent. I remember Hyundai changing their whole line of cars in 2007 to rebuild their brand and reputation, so I knew I was diving into uncharted territory going with the Hyundai over the Honda and Toyota, but for 15K out the door (for the automatic) compared to around 18K for the Civic and around 17K for the Corolla during that time and what they had to offer, I could not resist the deal. Another friend of mine went all in with the Elantra in 2007 as well, and he had done a lot of research and ended up purchasing a manual one before me, so after seeing him with his car for a year, that also lead to my reasoning that the car would be a good buy. I finally ended up selling the car to another cousin a few weeks ago and upgraded to something else, but I still miss it, although it may just be fresh in my mind given that I'm still getting used to my new car. The little things mattered to me with this car, such as having 4 wheel ABS compared to the 2 rear drum sets offered in the Honda and Toyota. Fog lights were nice to have since I had always wanted a car with fog lights. Having the overhead glasses compartment, top middle compartment, under radio compartment, 2 tier center compartment, and also the two storage spaces behind the front seats was also very nice. The only thing about the car that I didn't like was that it looked a little boring, or ""rental"" car-ish, but I was able to fix that after I finally upgraded to the 2011-2012 Elantra 16"" alloy rims, giving it the look that the SE had. The interior is very roomy, with good visibility, and I'm a big 6'1' guy. The front seats were very comfortable, compared to when I sat in the Civic and Corolla which were tight for me. Headroom is very good, although I do wish the driver's side had the handle to hold onto which is nice when you want to switch it up driving long distances. My passengers never complained, since the shortest person usually sat behind my seat which I had to push all the way back, but it seemed like everyone was fine most of the time.Another great feature that a lot of base model or step up from base model Japanese cars don't have is heated mirrors, which are very useful in the winter (even here in So Cal), and I took them for granted when I was looking for my new car, which I had to get a higher up model to get. Whenever I drove a lot of freeway, I would end up getting around 31-34 MPG depending on how fast I would accelerate, how much force I applied when braking, and how fast I would be going on the freeway. Combined, especially in the later years, the worse I ever got was 27 MPG, but when I drove gently I would get around 28-29 MPG. In the early years I was running on the stock 15"" steel wheels and afterwards I was running on the 16"" alloys, so those might have affected the fuel economy a little bit. I broke in the car very well when it was new, not pushing it during the recommended period, and had always changed oil myself with full synthetic 5W-20, usually Mobil 1, and in the end, I left the car off at 111K miles, with no issues whatsoever. I just performed the recommended maintenance at my favorite mechanic every time I hit the mileage listed in the Maintenance Book, and overall, the car had been very very reliable. Surprisingly, the trunk is also very large, compared to the same Civic and Corolla as well. I had been able to help friends move with the car, filling everything to the brim. My GLS model came with the auxiliary port, but I ended up using the MP3 CD a lot more due to consistency and quality issues. The 6 speaker system is phenomenal for a cheap car, better than the 2013 Accord LX's system that my family has. I'm no audiophile but I do enjoy my music and all the ranges my songs have to offer, and that is probably what I miss most from that system. Bass was deep and did not sound cheap, but vocals and everything were very clear as well! My friend put a sub-woofer in his, but honestly it was overkill since the stock system is already phenomenal. I have not been in another base model car that has an audio system that is as good as this one. Also, the car is hard to steal (unless there's some kind of new tech that thieves have access to). My friend locked my keys in my trunk once and you cannot put the seats down from the inside of the car. AAA came, unlocked the car, but the standard immobilizer didn't allow us to start the car and the alarm kept going off, so the only way was to get the other spare key/remote I had (Hyundai only gives 2 keys). Overall, the only con is the cheap plastic door panels, but I felt all other pieces in the car were pretty good quality.",,
5,An absolute bulletproof workhorse,Brian ,09/22/2015,5,5,4,,,5,5,5,4,,,"Let's be perfectly clear. This is a commuter car. If that is what you're looking for, then this is the best value there is.

I plug away the miles, in traffic and at 80mph day after day. There was some sort of sensor problem a couple years back, but that was while it was still under warranty and hasn't repeated. I'm about to roll over 100,000 and it is running like new. I fully expect to get well over 200,000 out of this little beast.Even though its small, i fit comfortable as a large man.

But first the few cons: I would like just a bit better fuel economy.And the 30,000 and 60,000 mile service costs seemed to me a bit on the high side.I wish the trunk lid would pop just a little so that I could nudge it up with my hip when my hands are full.As it is, it is necessary for me to empty at least one arm to get the lid up.I cant think of any more cons.-- I have not found engine noise on aggressive accelerations anything to complain aboutit is there, but its not a big deal to me.I seldom accelerate hard.Now this is what I like most:The car has great road manners.It feels tight and solid even after 60,000 miles.Road noise is not excessive.The steering is perfect.The breaks are sure and smooth.Acceleration is good.Instruments are easy to read.Controls are easy to reach.In the cold the car heats up and clears the windshield quicklyunlike so many cars, it is the drivers side that clears the fastest.

2.375,Time to trade in,sweed2 ,05/29/2011,,,2,4,3,1,,2,2,4,1,"I bought the Elantra new in 08'. The windshield wipers were never connected. I found this out on the highway in a torrential downpour with no breakdown lane. A couple of weeks later I got a flat took it to Pep Boys and they asked when I had patched the tire? I never did I thought it was new. Recall after recall. Cd player stopped functioning, window was slowly going down, and we kept having the problem. We just received the airbag recall notice.

& remote rearview mirrors, lighted vanity mirrors for BOTH front seats, MP3 jack, ESC, ABS, steering wheel radio and cruise controls, alloy wheels, fog lights, ALL STANDARD on SE! I like the much maligned cloth seats because they are warmer than leather in winter. Before buying I saw spotting complaints so I bought a couple cans of Scotchguard right away, and intend to re-spray this summer again. I've spilled spaghetti sauce on the seats and cleaned them with my Bisell and they're fine. No outside temp gauge is a big bummer, but they brought that back on 2011s.","Fix that trunk drainage channel, when the lid is fully open water drops right into the wheel well areas!

Extremely poor visibility out of the back angled windows- I just have to back up, and change lanes really slowly and pray no one crashes in to me 3.

2.5,Not so into this car,zygereyez ,03/05/2010,,,2,2,2,3,,3,3,3,2,I have had this car for a year now. When I bought this car it had 50 miles on it. I don't really like it much though. To me it's noisy when I drive. The alignment screwed up a few months after owning it. The dealership gave me crap when I took it in for the warranty to get my car fixed. My door handle on the outside of the car sticks and makes the door stay open. It sucks in the snow. The beak system sucks. I lightly touch them in the snow. I don't feel safe with the breaking system. It takes me 3 times to get it in reverse cuz it sticks.  There's a few more things wrong with it and it only has close to 28k miles on it. ,The gas milage isn't bad.,Driving in snow is a major thing to imporve. Maybe make it a little quieter while driving.

Even after a year of owning it every time I get in it to drive I'm so excited about owning it.  I've never been so happy with a car, but like some others have mentioned it handles very poorly in snowy conditions which is not good living in Wisconsin. I did a lot of research before I bought this car and never came across anything about that problem.  Also as some have mentioned the trunk does tend to pop open without me realizing it.   Other than that I do love it and would recommend it to anyone.",,

I paid 13,500 for it.  I've driven it 32,000 miles since I bought it 9 months ago. I'd say 30K miles were spent on I-95 to and from work at 80 miles an hour. The car does what it needs to do everyday- starts and stops.  There has been hesitation in the engine on more than one occasion.  Something to expect out of a car with 100K on the engine, not a brand new car.  I asked the maintenance people about this and they said that should be expected out of a Hyundai. The car came with features that would cost 30K on any other car. For the cost, the value is great.",Great first car for someone.  Make sure you buy the warranty. At 85 mph you can really hear the engine whining.  The road noise drowns out cellphone conversations above 55mph. I got my car up to 110 once.  The car handles well between 0 - 85.  Above that to much body roll.  Weaves traffic well.,The center console has this ugly cheap silver color to it.  The rest of the cabin is acceptable.  I can tell there are parts that are going to wear and look bad after a few years.  If I didn't have the warranty I would feel uncomfortable in keeping the car.

The ride is good, interior comfortable and pleasing to the eye, and it handles better then expected. Good stereo, excellent ergonomics, classy looking exterior.

This car is far from junk.","Interior space, control layout, remote keyless entry, power mirrors with defrost, cool blue interior lighting, XM radio, LOTS of storage bins and cubbys inside, big trunk, strong brakes, simple and stylish good looks.

I enjoyed the great MPG that the car had, as well as the good design and comfort. However, as time went on, I soon found myself to be an enemy with one thing: the trunk. If you do make the decision to buy this car, NEVER open it on a rainy day, at the risk of waterlogging everything inside your trunk. The design of the trunk pushes all the water on top of the trunk straight down into your carpeted trunk, making it incredibly difficult to deal with. Not only that, but it frequently unlatches itself, making it a safety hazard if you leave valuables in your trunk. Overall I'd say good buy, just be weary of the risks.","Auxiliary mp3 connection, XM radio option, safety features",Trunk!!!

I drive about 32 miles round-trip for my daily commute in Boston traffic, and my gas mileage still averages 30-34 mpg. It took a while to get used to the V4 engine, but it really moves great once you get up to speed. Unlike my Sebring, I can now have people sit in my backseat of my Elantra.

The gas mileage started low, but it's between 31 and 32 now for about a 12 mile commute weekdays.  There's plenty of room inside and lots of places to put bottles of liquid (it gets hot and dry here).  I find the car quiet, which is different from others - I have no explanation why, I just do.  The automatic transmission shifts smoothly and the car holds the road well at speed (65-70 mph).  Some people don't like the serpentine shift pattern, but it took me less than a week to get used to it.  ","I like the bluetooth cell phone system, and the XM radio.  The price was good for the features.","The A/C is weak, and needs to remain on the Max AC setting to work adequately.

I have already put 12,000 carefree miles on it and would recommend it highly!","Great fuel economy, most standard features in class BY FAR, interior room...especially in rear, seat comfort on long trips, good handling, ergonomics - everything is in the right place, standard XM, large trunk for a small car, nice (albeit not earthshaking)exterior design.","Power is adequate, but not great (an acceptable compromise for the good fuel economy), a few interior surfaces should have better tactile feel.

Those of you who complain about it should definitely consider spending more money and buy in another segment...Since I put brand new winter tires on, I don't get more than 27 MPG. Got free XM for 3 months then 4.99 $/month special; told them would cancel after and got another 3 months at 4.99/month...Bought the trunk tray and find it essential.

Suspension can be better. Also there is a little bit of cracking in the interior but can't complain since I got the car for only $14,200 (a lot of negotiating). This car is made for gas saving so don't expect any good acceleration for racing. A lot of room inside and trunk is huge. Looks a lot better with tinted Windows and make sure you get seat covers in they are not black. All my friends have been impressed. If I don't get any mechanical problems, I will recommend this car to everyone.

So far I LOVE it. Before this I was a strict 80s GM boat guy. This car is much quicker than I would have expected, and my MPG has been between 29-36mpg per tank. I am very happy, and I can't stress how much fun the car is to drive. The interior is more roomy than you would think from the outside and the back seat is more than sufficient. All around, I am very impressed with the quality of design in this car. I feel that Hyundai may be entering the realm that Toyota and Honda entered in the early 90's. Give it another few years and these cars will have the reputation they deserve!","Acceleration, gearbox, seats are pretty good. Radio is good. Interior is roomy and trunk as well. Braking is good.  Lets not forget the outstanding warranty and roadside assistance. Those would cost you much more in all other car companies.","Windows fog too easy. For whatever reason I always accidentally release my trunk on the keyfob and realize it on the road. Engine noise above 70mph.

I have not found one defect inside or out.  This car delivers up to 41 mpg on the freeway and as low as 27 city which is a huge range but with the AC off on short trips in a rural area I average 31mph. We also purchased a new Civic Ex about the same time for my wife.I have to say that the Elantra has a much smoother and more quiet ride than the Civic EX that my wife drives. The Elantra has a slower responsive steering set up but not sure if that is bad since I'm not racing the Indy 500. The interior could be nicer but for the money, this car is hard to beat.","I like the exterior styling, control panels and blue back lighting on the dash. Cruise control on steering wheel.  I like the sunroof and all the power options with controls buttons that are friendly to operate","More plush interior, power drivers seat, radio volume control on steering wheel.  Performance - more responsive steering ratio and maybe a little more horse power or a turbo option "

Hyundai's warranty can't be beat! I have been very happy with the car and am glad I didn't shell out extra money for a Honda or Toyota. A word of warning: a few months after I bought the car I received a letter from Hyundai Corp. that the fuel pump was recalled.

I will put >15k on it in 6 months and have been completely satisfied with everything about the car. Good assembly, good materials, quiet comfortable cabin, nice acceleration, great MPG (30.5 over >12k), and brakes. It has nice touches throughout the car at such a good price.

Was looking at the Honda Civic and then the Consumer Reports review came out on the Elantra, peeking my curiosity.  After renting an Elantra for a week, I decided to purchase one with leather and a sunroof.  I could not find one anywhere close to where I live, all the dealers laughed at me for trying to find one.  I finally located one 500 miles away with everything I wanted and drove it home.  I am extremely satisfied with it, gets almost 36 MPG highway and about 30 locally. It has plenty of pep and is responsive, the sound system is excellent, the car is quiet inside and has plenty of room upfront. This car is a bargain.  ","Stereo, interior space, MPG, blue lights","A mute button on the steering wheel stereo controls, 12 VDC power outlet that does not turn off when the car is off, autolock door programming able to be set with out the dealer, built in garage door transmitter buttons.....these are all very inexpensive items that would greatly improve the car"

Pzero, fuel economy, fun to drive and less of an economy feel than expected. Hyundai certainly has come a long way.  Thank goodness the hybrids at the time were too in demand and their dealers were so high and mighty. We started to look most fuel efficient and then cost efficient and ended up at a Hyundai dealer. After checking consumer comments here, the price and the test drive, there was nothing left but to do the smart thing and buy.  The sparkles in the paint help it look clean even when it's not - bonus for the lazy owner. ","Fuel economy, low cost - the 2 big factors in us buying this car to begin with. Safety features and ratings are great.","I'm of the opinion no seat can be too comfortable, definitely wouldn't mind some softer seats with more angles of positioning.

We took a long 2,000.00 journey and the car performed great and was a pleasure to drive.  Two weeks ago we were rear ended at a light by a SUV and forced in to a truck in front of us (bad enough to declare the car totaled).

It has zippy performance and gets 27MPG City and 35 MPG Hwy in the process.  Braking is excellent. The four wheel discs do make a difference. The sound system with the XM radio, while not world class, is very pleasant to listen to.  In town, it handles beautifully.  At speed, there is a bit of extra body roll (especially right turns for whatever reason). I would recommend the 5 spd M.  It makes for much more driving fun. The shifter does great as long as you don't force it.  This car is extremely comfortable under pretty much all conditions (front and back). There are a lot of things ""well done"" about this car. ",Love the blue displays.  Easy on the eyes.  The seats are comfortable front and back.  The car also has an extremely solid feel.  No creaks or rattles.  It has the look and feel of a car that costs thousands of dollars more.  Best new car value on the road in my opinion.   ,"Some of the plastic parts on the interior are a little on the Spartan side.

This car is comparable to all of these in style, comfort, and performance.  A side by side comparison of the Elantra and Civic will show very similar numbers on and off paper.  I purchased my SE at the base model GLS price of 13,800.  Buy consumer reports car buyers guide, that shows dealer prices, and you should get to that price too.  I also purchased the extended 10 years 100,000 miles warranty for $1,200.  I am not certain about the reliability of the ""new"" Hyundais, there was a drastic redesign introduced in 2004, but with this bumper to  bumper 100,000 mile warranty I don't have to worry about anything.","This vehicle is very roomy. The fit and finish is nicer than a Civic. The car performs on par with a Civic.  The standard options for this car are great.  Namely the airbags that surround the entire roof of the vehicle. I also test drove an Accent, but didn't feel safe in either the 2 or 4 door.","Lower lumbar support in the seats. Tires seem to spin, even with ESC and EBA engaged, when going around street corners at high rates of speed. This might be because I became used to my old cars 17X7 directional tires.

4.625,Value over all others,Dave ,08/11/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Just recently purchased the Elantra and the deciding factor was cost.  I own a Civic and the Elantra is just as good, if not better.  Plus it costs about $3k less.  The car is really responsive and is great with gas mileage.  I have been getting about 31 miles in mixed driving, mainly city.  There are plenty of cup holders (Civic has just 2 - go figure that one out) and plenty of storage space.  The trunk is very roomy.  I do not think you can go wrong purchasing an Elantra.","Clutch is really easy to use, it is peppy, plenty of storage space and it even comes with an arm rest, unlike the Saturn Astra and Honda Fit.

I thought that downsizing to a car would be depressing actually (have been driving trucks/SUV's since 1995), but the Elantra is surprisingly great.  It's loaded with features that you would pay extra for in other vehicles in the same class.  Someone listed the front seat as needing lumbar support, but it feels fine to me.

I was particularly drawn to the SE model for the standard Electronic Stability Control. Safety in a smaller car was a big concern, having always driven a large van or SUV. The ESC answered that concern. The adjustment from driving a large SUV to the Elantra took no time at all. The seats are comfortable and it handles like a dream. Road noise is almost nonexistent.

And it handles better than one first expects on windy roads.  Among its peer group, it is more refined and understated than the others, and more comfortable. And, one can buy a fully ""loaded model"" for about the same price as very lean models from Japan. The satellite radio sounds very nice and is easy to use.  On long trips, its very comfortable, which is unusual among cars in this class. We obtained much better gas mileage (40 ish) on the highway at 65-72 mph than EPA or CR reports, admittedly with a light foot.  Its only weaknesses so far are its somewhat numb steering and a rather slow take off. ",I suppose its best single feature is its front seat. The driver has an excellent view of the road and all controls. The seat is comfortable and (with leather) heated. ,"The car really is an excellent value as is, the only improvements that I can suggest are minor ones: improved road feel through the steering wheel, a few more options on the trip computer, a bit more adjustability in the seat.

I still like approaching it in a parking lot and still think it is pretty cute. I got a 5 speed because I had one as a kid and was going through a mid-life thing! The gas mileage is a steady 29-31 depending where I drive. I still really like it overall. My husband keeps asking me if I still like it and it has been 8 months. I am not sure when he thinks I will say no. But I hope never!,The Hyundais great warranty package. (That is what got me!) And the mileage! (I wish I had gotten a sun roof!),"The wheel covers... one of mine broke when a teen in a truck merged on without looking and I had to go in the dirt. A rock must have hit and they are obviously not even strong plastic. The lighter interior seems to get dirty  very easily, even when you spill water."

I test drove Civics and Corollas (in my price range) for about two months and something wasn't grabbing me. As soon as I test drove the Elantra, I knew that was my car. The interior is really good looking (get so many compliments, especially at night with the blue lights). I also love all the features (esp. the XM and radio controls on the steering wheel) and the drive is very smooth and secure. The car turns well and I love driving on the highway (quiet, good pickup). NOTE: I got a spoiler and it makes it that much cuter!","The blue interior lights, radio controls on steering wheel, amazing warranty, tons of extras at great price",Engine is a little noisy around 35 mph (don't know why). I also think the front end is not as good looking as the rear; changing the shape of the front slightly and swapping out the grill would make the car perfect from the outside!
5,I love my car,Linda ,06/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased my auto Elantra Se in Feb 08.  I love the mileage I'm getting. I average 29-31 miles combined city/hw driving.

Normal everyday mixed driving avg has been 30 mpg's. Driving for long periods have been comfortable and enjoyable. During heavy rain, the stability control worked well. The heated seats warmed up quick, the stereo & XM have great a sound. The Electric Steering make parallel parking easy. One slight thing I noticed is the air conditioning seems a bit weak compared to my previous Elantra's (not bad, but did notice a change - may be due to the cabin being larger).",Great Stereo w/XM & steering wheel controls -- Blue instrument lighting is awesome -- Steering wheel feels so precise and steady -- All controls are easy to use and feel/look great. ,Daytime Running Lights and Remote Start would be nice.

What I found was a most welcomed and  impressive sales organization and in the case of the vehicle I brought home; the 2008 Hyundai Elantra GLS with the power package intact, the most outstanding vehicle I have personally owned and I was born when Harry Truman was a feisty ""show me"" President.

I looked at the Mazda 3 & the Honda Civic. I just couldn't get a better price for the features that I got. My car is loaded with everything including leather. I'm very impressed with the fuel economy & I already have over 6k miles on my car. Rear seat passengers are always impressed with the leg room that a car this small offers.

I love the standard features.  My bf was really pushing me towards Toyota or Honda until I showed him the price breakdowns including taxes, license, and interest expense.  It adds up!

We must say that it certainly does that and then some with 28 mpg in the city and over 35 mpg on the highway!  And that is with the air conditioner going all the time.  Our mileage has almost doubled from our Cruiser and you can't beat the 5 year/60,000 mile bumper-to- bumper warranty.  You don't get that with Honda, Toyota, GM or Ford!

I am 6'2"" 215lbs, and I fit very comfortably in the driver's seat.  The upgrades stereo with XM and and AUX input makes this car a great boom box on wheels.

The car was pretty difficult to find - there were only about 12 in the entire state of California.  I personally think the exterior is quite stylish, much better than the civic or pre-2009 corolla models.  Main gripes are that acceleration in PZEV is a bit poor (132hp instead of 138), and that gas mileage is not as good as corolla or civic (I get about 30 mpg highway, 22 or so city).  Still, amazing value for money. I purchased for $16.8K all in, including California Taxes, Title & Registration (which are about $1600). I think (and hope) that this is pretty competitive deal considering the sunroof and heated seats.","The SE offers great standard features, including ABS, Stability Control, Side Airbags, XM Radio, Leather Steering Wheel, iPod jack, Fog Lights, etc. Sunroof & Heated Seats are great additions with the premium package.

5,Must Buy,Big Dog ,04/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is a great car.  Fuel economy is as advertised.  It's a lot more sporty than advertised too.  It has a huge trunk and both my kids carseats fit in very well.  The blue lighting is great at night.  The manual shift is very easy.  I climb over the Blue Ridge mountain to and from work everyday and this car makes it up and down with no problems.  I pass by the Yaris and Versa and laugh.  This car is nice.,"Blue lights, more power than expected, space in the trunk and seats.  The overall design of the interior is perfect, easy to reach knobs.  The Hyundai warranty is the best.","There are no improvements, this is a great designed car."
4.75,A lot of bang for your buck,alfarocat ,04/12/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"There are a lot of features that are standard here (example: ABS) that are extra on similar cars, like the Toyota Corolla. It's got great safety features--6 airbags! The interior is roomy and comfortable. The dash instrumentation is nice. Acceleration, while not great, is good enough. It's got XM radio, free for 3 months.","Good trunk space. Fold down seats for added space. Lots of holders for coins, glasses, and more. I got heated seats and love them for Chicago's winters. Also heated mirrors and sunroof (or is it moon???) Electronic stability for skids (haven't had to use it yet so don't know how good it is)","With the window open, I can't rest my elbow because it's too far away. I wish it had molding on the side to prevent the usual nicks and dings. I also like an upholstered door, which it doesn't have.

4.875,QuickSilver Luxury,Ralph T. ,04/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"This is my third Elantra and it is by far the best.  It is loaded with features and it has been turning heads wherever I go.  That's pretty cool when you turn heads in a car that cost less than 20K. The only option I did not get was leather, but the cloth seats warm up quickly on these cool northeast mornings.  Next week I am taking it on a trip and I can't wait to see how comfortable it is on the long trip.

4.75,Excellent car in price class,Ray ,04/04/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Make no mistake, this is not a 32,000 dollar car, though Quality for cost is superb. Between 16,000 and 18,000 you will not find a better quality means of transportation. The Elantra is fun to drive with a great popular package features. The warranty on the car matches and or beats other motor companies. Surprisingly roomy interior, I am 6'2 and sit comfortable inside the vehicle. Fuel mileage is at 35 mpg with 65% highway driving. Exterior to interior noise control is that of a 26,000 to 32,000 dollar sedan. Purchasing this vehicle was not on the spur of the moment, Four months of going to one dealer to the next.

4.875,Great Car! Great Price!,angelrose971 ,04/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"My initial criteria for buying a new car was it had to have fuel efficiency of at least 35 MPG, have 4 doors, and be comfortable for me to drive. I narrowed my search to 3 vehicles, 3 different manufacturers. Surprisingly, the Elantra wasn't one of them but I decided to look at it after ruling out the Accent (only because of comfortability). I'm not disappointed and very happy that I did indeed look at and test drive the Elantra. What a great car for a great price!",The Elantra has great storage inside with several compartments and a good sized glove box. The trunk is surprisingly spacious as is the interior. The radio is great as it allows for several station pre-sets.,"When driving on residential roads which are mainly 30-35 MPH, the car seems to run rough as these speeds are just before the gears shift. Under 30 or 36 and the car runs great!"
4.25,Engine Issues,prof ,04/01/2008,,,5,5,5,3,,4,4,4,4,"The Elantra is a nice car with a great interior and decent performance.  I was surprised to find out the engine uses a timing belt whereas the competition from Toyota, Honda, Mazda, gm, ford, chrysler have graduated to timing chains that never require replacement.  Worse than that, the engine is a ""interference design"", meaning that if the timing belt ever breaks, the valves will crash into the pistons and destroy the engine.  Interference designed engines were phased out by most manufacturers in the 1990's.  A broken belt leading to engine destruction is a gamble that we dont have to take in 2008.

I had just driven a fit when I walked next door to the Hyundai dealer and drove the elantra. I was very impressed. Feature content was unmatched, very comfortable (I am 6,2""), and visibility is excellent. Power is ok and mpg's are excellent. The most pleasant surprise to me was at 80 mph on the interstate it is really quiet. Nice build quality.

3.75,"Decent Car, but missed the mark",Andrew Carson ,03/21/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,1,5,2,"I saw the car, and for $14,305, I thought about it before buying.  I looked at the Lancer, Civic, Corolla, Sentra, Spectra, Focus, Cobalt, VW Rabbit, and the Mini Cooper.  The Hyundai just seemed to be the best deal on a new car.  I took it on a long test drive, and determined I had found the right one.  Two days afterwards, I knew I had made a mistake.  The seat doesn't line up with the pedals, the pedals are lined up terribly, and the seat is terribly uncomfortable.  The pedals themselves are lined up terribly, with a gas pedal close to the seat, and the clutch having a long throw.  Excellent value in a car unless you are over six feet tall.","Six airbags, electric power steering, fuel economy, build quality, great initial value.","Line the steering wheel, pedals, and the seat up right.  Give the customer a radio and A/C standard.  Let it handle better in corners.  Smooth out the engine.  And get the pedals to act like those in a Miata, perfectly spaced and perfect pedal travel."
5,Phenomenal!!!!,Joan H ,03/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Checked on-line for gas mileage and reliabilty and of course I had my choices from Hyundai's, Honda's, Kia's, Toyota's, and Saturns. I checked them all out and test drove a couple of them until I test drove the Hyundai Elantra. I had large vehicle that I was trading in and was used to a lot of room and the Elantra was not lacking any compared to the others. I did not feel cramped like some of the other cars I was in and felt very comfortable and secure.

Steering on my unit is responsive and well-balanced, yet several units I test-drove had what felt like over-responsiveness to steering wheel movement.   City ride is comfortable; minor bumps feel like minor bumps.  Highway ride is comfortable too; easy to hit 70mph without feeling any loss of control.  No difference in performance between wet and dry roads.  Acceleration is adequate for ordinary highway merge, but is definitely geared towards fuel economy rather than fun. However, I did need to gun it once, and boy did it respond.  Braking is smooth, although I have not needed to stop short.

The price was the decider here and had to stay in budget.  The car gives so much value for the money.  My husband has a 2005 and while neither car has a lot going on in the power department it is definitely better than anything in its price range as far as features goes.  I was less than thrilled to drive it off the lot but as time goes by I am really starting to appreciate the car.  It turns heads at times which is a surprise and the biggest comment I get is THATS A HYUNDAI!  The interior is very stylish and does not feel cheap.

4.875,Great Smaller Car,Lane Benda ,03/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Traded large car on this car because of fuel prices and no longer needing a large car (Buick). Looked at other makes of this size car. This one was the best for the money and has a lot of new features found on cars costing much more. My wife loves it. Drives nice and looks good.

Civics are far too expensive, even taking in to account their high residuals. We chose the Elantra SE over the GLS with preferred package, as for around $1000 in our case, we got the tremendous Stability Control, which Consumer Reports magazine say is the most significant safety feature on cars since the seat belt. See Hyundai web site for details of this & other SE features. The room inside is amazing, the ergonomics are superb. Little things, like doors opening a full 90 degrees to make entry/exit easier.

5,Great car for the price!,Drew Miller ,02/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am incredibly happy with my purchase.  I had test driven the '09 Corolla, Dodge Caliber, Mitsubishi Lancer, Kia Spectra, etc.  The only car that I liked more was the '09 Corolla (the '08 is horrendous to me) as it handled better and was a more comfortable ride.  However, the Elantra offers many of the exact same features and includes a warranty that on the Corolla you have to purchase in addition to your vehicle to even come close.  The Elantra does lack power on uphill climbs, but it cruises everywhere else.  I'm getting about 33-35mpg mainly highway, about 28-29 city since buying it (have filled up twice).  After the special financing, bought the car for $10K LESS than the Corolla!","XM Radio, Easy Cruise Control, Tons of Interior Space, Comfortable ride, Great Gas Mileage, Good standard sound system, good trunk space.  Got it OTD for $1K less than what Edmunds says is invoice. Great, great deal on an awesome car.",Make audio controls standard.  Offer Bluetooth package on the GLS.

The quality is just there. Absolutely superb. Very smooth on freeway, tight suspension rides nice although it's body roll in corners could be less. It's been said before that it looks like a baby Lexus or something, and in my silver color with tinted windows it does. I actually get a few looks. Rims are sharp looking.

The Hyundai is typically a couple grand cheaper and you get more bang for the buck. The gas mileage is decent but not great -- I think Toyota and Honda may have this car beat. I average about 23-24 MPG with mixed city and highway driving, though I do drive fast on the highway. The car is very comfortable and roomy. It feels like a midsize rather than a compact. The interior is very classy. The Elantra simply looks a lot better on the inside than the Corolla, which looked cheap and out of date. There is plenty of room in the backseat for passengers and the trunk is a good size. Overall ride is smooth.","Interior -- the blue lighting is a nice touch and the seats are very comfortable and don't feel cheap.  Size -- Plenty of room for a ""compact"" sedan.  Warranty -- Speaks for itself. Though the full warranty is only 6 years/60k (the 100k warranty is powertrain only), it's still a great deal.","Performance -- The Elantra has a 2.0L, 4 cyl. engine, so don't expect too much horsepower.

This car has it all in spades! It's unheard of to have stability control in a car at this price. And it's a blast to drive.
