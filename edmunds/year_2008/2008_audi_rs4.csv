5,Audi Should Just Bring This Car Back to the US,audirs ,12/29/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My 2008 Audi RS4 with the available options has now turned 32,000 miles. The hardest part of owning this car during my 60 mile per day over a twisty highway is in keeping my speeds down.I put a K&N air filter in, and keep the S button pushed down and whether it is raining or dry, the handling, sounds, speed, control and Gallardo sourced brakes are incredible.This is a phenomenal car.Buy one if you want a Porsche GT3 with usable back seats, that in turn can be flattened out to create a cargo bay, or a place for your dogs to lay down on a trip.Unbelievable car!","V-8 power.
Intoxicating sound.
With the P-Zero Nero tires, grip whether wet or dry conditions is beyond reproach.
The Lamborghini Gallardo sourced brakes emblazoned with their RS4 labelling stop the car on a dime.
Turning radius is short and easy, and the short throw shifter is terrific.","A few more gallons of gas in the tank to expand range.
Two more inches of knee space for the back seats.
And now, in 2011, a better Navigation system."
4.875,Awesome car!,Mark ,07/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is one of the greats, for sure. Classic lines, great build quality, amazing powertrain.  The engine always feels 'on boil' and the transmission gearing matches the power band perfectly.  Great noises - I almost never turn on the radio with this engine and exhaust note filling the cabin. Still gets a lot of looks even though the B8 body style is out.  I'll be keeping this one for a long time to come. ","Engine, acceleration, exhaust note, brakes, exterior appearance.","Navigation system, rear seat space, armrest needs a redesign."
4.875,Best Audi Ever,JT ,03/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is one of the Best cars out there, better than a BMW M3 or M5, Better than a Benz 63AMG.   I enjoyed Herb's comments on this car, obviously he's never driven an RS4 and must dislike Audi.  Anyone who compares this car to an EVO is, well, not well informed.  Best of luck to you Herb!!  LOL  There's no car out that that can compare to this, it looks like a cute little kitty, but can tear your head right off.  Handling is out of this world and has a fully defeatable traction control which blows your mind.","Acceleration, build and quality.",Price.  More expensive than a M3.
4.75,It is a rocket ship,Dave ,02/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"First, the Review by Herb posted earlier about this car...is complete nonsense. He clearly has NOT driven an RS4. Everyone that goes for a ride or drives this car...wants one! This is a monster in a business suit! It can rip 100mph quickly from stoplight to stoplight, if you are not careful. This car is about performance and handling with a lot of luxury. Any mention of an Evo or a Subi is ridiculous...this is not an A4 review. The suspension on the RS4 can turn 75-80mph on the highway exchange loop, yes I have done this several times. It performs that well! The car can be pushed farther than I am willing to push it. ",It accelerates like a rocket! As soon as it warms up outside I am going to take to the local drag strip and see what numbers we can get it to turn! ,The only comment that I have is that apparently the new HP engines are built to burn clean emissions and use more oil than previous engines. The dealership is telling me it needs oil between oil changes?!?
3,"Not Truly an ""R"" Car",Herb Morgan ,01/22/2009,,,5,3,5,3,,1,5,1,1,"After owning 3 Evos, I really regret buying this car.  The gear box is very clunky and sounds frightening on cold shifts.  The acceleration is rather flaccid because of the low torque output. The brakes are mediocre and really upset the balance of the car on hard braking. The engine note is horrible.  On acceleration the engine makes an excruciatingly high pitched whining nose with no corresponding feeling of acceleration. The steering is terribly numb requiring constant adjustments in corners. Understeer is its preferred mode in corners. It also gets miserable gas mileage, on par with cars with bigger engines and more horsepower. The in-dash CD player went out within 500 miles.",The interior.,"Audi should not market this car under the ""R"" badge. In my opinion it is not a ""sports"" sedan, it is merely an overly expensive, but comfortable highway cruiser. I feel that if you want a 4-door, AWD car that you can drive spiritedly and have fun in, save your money and buy an Evo or an STi. "
