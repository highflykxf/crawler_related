So I though this Lexus would be even better, with the existing notion of reliability of Japanese cars. Unfortunately, this car has been disappointing. The transmission jerks between lower gears (1-2-3, especially). It has a horrible rattling noise from the underbody; took to several places and no-one can fix it. It is very basic for the price I paid. No bluetooth, nav, or even backup camera. Poor traction/stability control in the Michigan snow.",,
5,Excellent car,Carol ,09/23/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,I have had this car since 2007. It has virtually given me no trouble at all. Everything has held up beyond anything I ever expected from a vehicle,,
5,Love this RX 350!,Mark Wilhoite ,09/22/2016,5,5,5,,,,5,5,5,,,This is my second RX.  The first was a 04 RX 330.  I like this car so much better because it has the larger 3.5 engine and along with that no timing belt to replace!  This model also has updated navigation and Bluetooth along with voice command.  I love the Lexus brand and the great reviews this car has.  I recommend it!,,
5,Lexus lives up to its reputation,Randall in Dallas ,07/22/2016,5,4,5,,,5,4,5,5,,,"I was looking for a mid-size SUV with power, luxury comfort, good handling, solid engineering, minimal maintenance and a quiet ride. I did a lot of research and test drove 7 different brands. The Lexus was clearly superior to all of the others. The RX350 checked all of the boxes and then some. It is as solid as a tank but it drives like a sport sedan. I knew I'd be sacrificing some MPG to get the power & responsiveness I wanted but I have been very pleased with the mileage considering I drive about 75% city and 25% highway. If I ever get tired of this car I know my next one will be a Lexus too.",,
3,So you thought you had a reliable car!,No longer Lexas fan ,05/28/2016,3,,4,,,2,4,4,5,,,"I love the way this car drives and the comfort at this car. The breaking of the car is excellent. However the alternator was replaced at 75,000 miles and today at just less than 90,000 miles I have had to replace the power steering train which is 2000+ dollars and the back right strut which is another $750.  I don't consider this a good buy when at 90,000  miles a powertrain starts leaking. I've had BMWs before and never had the issues that I have had with this car now.  Today I have a new model SUV that's on loan to me and I was considering a purchase possibly have a newer car since my car is 2008 however after seeing the repairs today I don't trust Lexus to be that good a car. I kept my BMWs 13 and 15 years and never had the major repairs that this car has had. So much for all of the reviews that say this car is so incredibly reliable.",,

This is happening to Lexus vehicles across the country.  Lexus has admitted the problem and issued a ""warranty enhancement"" saying they will replace the faulty dashboards at no cost.  The problem is they have no intention of fixing these dashboards.  I have been on their repair list for well over one year, each time I call they give excuses that they are waiting on parts.  When I ask when the parts might be in?  Their response ""sometime maybe this year or next year"".  Buy at your own risk, if anything is faulty they do not stand by their product.",,
3,Funky shifting when turning to the right,ruttroshaggy ,03/20/2016,4,4,5,,,5,5,3,5,,,"I have owned 4 Lexus's(Lexi?) before buying my wife a 2008 RX350. Loved a 2000 Rx350, 2005 GX was blah, the 2008 RX350 was the worst of the bunch. Boring driving, not refined at all. Nothing special about it. It had a soft supension and steering that rolled in the corners. The major problem I had was with the shifting, when you would turn to the right from a stop, it would take 2-3 seconds to engage after you turned, besides annoying it was dangerous. When taken to the dealer, they said it was normal. I traded that off for an Escalade the next day. After owning a Cadillac SRX, my wife wants to buy another Lexus, so we have been looking at them again , and it seems there have been a few complaints about tranny issues with the older Lexus. I have owned five Lexi, and after owning several Cadillacs lately, I am ready to get back to a more reliable vehicle, although the problem with the 2008 kept me away from Lexus for 5 years.",,

In that time I've replaced a water pump (~$500) and a rack & pinion (~$1800).  Everything else has been general maintenance (oil/brake/filter changes, etc.)The car handles well on the road, and I love the feel of driving it.  Unfortunately, the interior of the car has some major issues.The GPS is dated and clumsy to use.  The controls for adjusting many common things like fan speed are buried inside a digital menu system that is difficult to use while driving if you want any more control than adjusting a temp and letting it decide whether to blow full speed or low speed fan to achieve that temp.  There is no USB / aux input so you're stuck using a tape deck adapter or replacing the stereo console if you want to connect your phone.My biggest problem, however, has been that my dashboard cracked & melted (pics: http://imgur.com/a/B62He)This is part of known issue (https://www.carbuyingtips.com/articles/blog/lexus-to-pay-for-cracked-dashboard-repairs.htm) and is being replaced as part of a warranty recall.  However, I've been on a wait list for 9 months to get this replaced, and Lexus is sending 1 or 2 replacements each week to the dealership in my area.  Their backlog is over 500 now, and Lexus continues to send 1 or 2 parts each week to fix this.  That's going to be 5-10 years at this pace for people near the back of the wait list, and there are almost certainly more people out there waiting to be added to this list.  Completely unacceptable response from Lexus.",,

So basically we have been looking for the next car for 7 years.  Having 2 younger children we were set on another three row vehicle, but were not happy with the costs of a new Pilot, Acadia, Highlander, etc.  We then looked at the two row luxury market and almost got a Volvo xc70.

I like all the bells and whistles that it came with, such as the telescoping steering wheel and leather seats just to name a few. I drove it from SC to TX and the drive was excellent, nice and quiet. I do not like the front design, it looks too feminine and also the so claimed re sale value is terrible.

There is a persistent rattle in the rear passenger window that looks like it is caused by a faulty window assembly.  The bumper rattles when turning.

When I took the car in for the 15,000 mile checkup, dealer informed me that tires needed changing.  Dealer said Lexus cars come equipped with low quality tires (Goodyear).

But I will say the changes made from 2004 to 2008 were needed; performance is better, tighter, and overall a real pleasure.  The vehicle is now 3 months old and my wife constantly reminds me of how much she LOVES her new car.

There is no manual Off switch to turn the lights off while the engine is running.  Sometimes we're not ready to immediately drive away or get out of the vehicle.

4.75,A tad disappointed,tammy ,01/15/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,I leased a new RX 350 a month ago as my ES 330 lease expired.  I needed more room and at a minimum fold down seats.  The IS was the only model with fold downs and that was too small.  Room is great - feels spacious inside- kids have a lot of room in the back.  Got an annoying dash vibration noise in a week and I do hope that can be fixed - very annoying.  Feel that the road noise is quite high.  Handling is excellent - very good acceleration and fit is finish is superb.,Power liftgate - power steering wheel (tilts up when you remove the key) - 40/20/40 split seats - easy to read display,3 setting memory seats (just has 2).

I go through about 35k miles a year, so comfort and quality are my biggest concerns and this vehicle meets these with no problems at all.  I trade out about every year and this is by-far the most enjoyable midsize SUV that I have owned. And I have driven everything from Toyota to BMW to Honda.  There are a few weird things could be changed but not every vehicle is perfect.  Great choice for a comfortable and stylish ride and perfect for sales!

I didn't expect it to be anything like that but am surprised at the lack of quality I've experienced. I've had two new batteries the first month, not sure why. The driver seat is already showing wear and darkening after a short 6 months. At 10,000 miles the interior rattles began. First the dash and then the windows. I've not been able to get these corrected after 3 attempts. The motor started making a rattling noise in the mornings. Only during the first 5 minutes then it's fine.

Clearly there were focus groups held and Toyota/Lexus listened! Better acceleration/power, better fuel economy, and all the right upgrades to the navigation system.

I was used to a car that was much heavier with a lower horsepower rating that outperformed this dog.

I love everything about the car, from its great looks to the wonderfully comfortable ride.  The car has plenty of pep, and gets above average gas mileage for an SUV.  The interior cabin is so quiet that it feels like you're in a sound proof room; no road or engine noise at all.  The car has just about every luxury feature you can imagine, including a color video back-up camera which is very useful.

The RX was involved in a moderate collision ($2500 in damages to the lower front end) but was able to drive away from the accident.  I can't say that for the other vehicle.  The Lex is indeed a safe ride. That aside, the only thing I miss about my '05 Solara convertible is the stereo, oh and the convertible part.  At the first service interval, I had the dealership install a hitch receiver so I can use a bike rack.  Not cheap but worth it, just like the car itself.  The only thing that has failed is the express-close feature on the moon roof.  The shop was able to reset it.   ","I still rely on the nav and back-up camera unit with integrated bluetooth and don't like driving without it.  Also, I finally got to see the rain-sensing wipers in action.  Nice!  I still like the looks of it better than anything out there right now.

I thought I was buying a luxury SUV, but that was not the case.  There is way more road noise than I expected.  I don't know if this is due to the tires or a lack of cabin insulation.  The ride is average, definitely not luxurious, and do not plan on seating more than four adults comfortably.  Also, the radio is terrible for a car in this price range.  It crackles already at medium volume.

The 2008 is smoother, quieter, faster and slightly more fuel efficient than the 330s. The transmission shifts seamlessly and the power comes on more smoothly. This car is one that can handle many needs. Its very comfortable and all the controls are easy to use. Everything works perfectly. The back-up camera and gen 5 nav systems are definitely upgrades over the 2005. Both previous RXs were very reliable with no service issues at all, and this 2008 should be the same.

Basic sound system is shockingly poor. My 2000 F-150 system is better. We assumed the sound system would be superb and failed to even turn it on during the test drive. I assumed Lexus would overachieve on this basic. Dealer says that's how they all sound. I would have paid for the premium system but there weren't any on the lot.

I'm a first time Lexus owner and the transition from internet inquiries to actual possession was very smooth and professional!   I will admit, there's a bit more wind noise than I anticipated (based on the reviews); but it's still a quiet ride.  I had to make adjustments to the way I would normally sit in order to be truly comfortable in the driver's seat.   The navigation system seems adequate (I've compared it to Mapquest/Yahoo Maps and find them to be a bit more precise).

With the 18 inch wheels, it handles pretty much like a car and not a truck.  It also now has plenty of power.  Very comfortable, and mileage is around 18-19, which I consider terrific for a new car weighing over 2 tons.

Put in the key and the seat, outside mirrors and steering wheel move back to one of two memorized locations.  That first five seconds alone make the RX 350 better than my other rides. The all-wheel-drive keeps the tires locked to the pavement as the ""killer corssover"" eagerly accelerates under a heavy foot.  With a minivan ride / height, you are not going to rail any corners.

I suppose that's better than just flipping over but that's why it gets a 7 for performance.",Two words: Touchscreen navigation.  It's nicely integrated and I hear that it accepts over 100 voice commands.  I can only remember several at this early point in my ownership experience.   The non-freon using air conditioning makes colder air than others.  The dual zone feature makes us both happy,The navigation replaces a smaller screen that would give fuel economy numbers and that feature ought to be included on the nav-screen.
