5,Have loved this vehicle,Ron M ,11/02/2016,5,,,,,5,,5,,,,Had for 7+ years. 2008 Honda Element SC  used for sales and service calls. Could not ask for more. Have even slept in the back while traveling.  Only bad/ disappointing issue has been poor headlight/ night visibility. I have loved this vehicle and would buy another one if they were still available.,,
5,2008 element - saved my life,Hcarew ,10/03/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,Wonderful car. Airbags everything worked head on collision with Tahoe going 45 to 50 miles an hour. Walked away with minor injuries. Recommend this card to everyone I meet,,
5,"2008 Element SC  - Yes, the hard to find SC.",Angus Young ,09/10/2015,5,4,5,,,5,5,4,4,,,"Very practical and useful car and at $22,500 (Had a Honda $1500 end of year discount and the dealer came down another $1600 or so), it's not too much cash. Yes, a BOX ON WHEELS.  I always get looks from other ELEMENT Owners because I don't think many of them knew about the SC version. I didn't like the ones with the flat black fenders (LX) and the flat black bumpers (EX).  The SC has no flat black body panels.  I bought it new in  late summer of 2008 and it was HARD to find an SC!  There are 6 or 8 HONDA  dealers within 20/25 miles of me and only 2 had SC's.   And only ONE dealer had every color. The other dealer had  ONE black and ONE blue one.  That's it.  I have 110k miles on the car and aside from a problem with the Throttle Position Sensor at about 80k, the car has been flawless. 110k miles and just that one repair  (outside of the usual brakes, tires, battery) Seats are comfy, the doors open a full 90 degrees for easy loading and unloading, and with the rear seats removed there is quite a bit of room.  THE AC is powerful as is the heater. The XM radio sounds great, especially with the 8 or whatever speakers this thing has and the sub-woofer up front.   It's the newer 2.4 Liter engine used in the Accords and CR-V's with a TIMING CHAIN, not a BELT!  That's a maintenance saver right there.  Timing Chains rarely wear out.   Just had new plugs put in at 103k miles and while driving out of Chicago on the Expressway, I just noted to myself that  his car drives as good as it did when new. My original Honda tires lasted about 68k miles. My original brakes up front and on the rear last about 75k miles. I am still on the original discs with 110k miles but I suspect I'll need new discs in about 4 to 10 k miles and it may be time for brakes again. With the SC package and the wider, lower profile 18"" tires it grabs the road good and corners well. Brakes could be a bit better.   My last car was a 4800 lb SUV and it stopped better. The only drawbacks I see are the ride, the MPG,  and the quality of plastic used inside. I have the SC, which has lower profile tires, stiffer springs, and is a bit lower to the ground than the other Elements. So, not sure if the other models (EX and LX)  ride better but the SC has a jarring ride at times.   Where I live  (Northern IL) the roads are pretty crummy. Lots of trucks and snow and salt. The  Element SC seems to go over the bigger holes good but some of the smaller dips in the road are really noticeable. My wife's 20 year old Civic with 20 years old shocks has a better ride on the roads with these little dips in them. I get about 23 MPG city and 26 on the highway.  I am getting 1 MPG better or so than the sticker indicated but I would have figured a small engine like this would get a few more MPG.  Second, the interior plastic scratches quite easily. I have hauled a few things and it does not take  much to scratch/gouge the plastic inside. It only seats 4, which is sometimes a pain if my kid has more than 1 friend that needs to be brought someplace, that one has to sit in the front. But, on the bright side, the rear seats have plenty of room AND THEY RECLINE! My daughter loves reclining the seat a bit on long drives and relaxing. The Vehicle Stability control is a joke.  The SC only comes Front Wheel drive so this may seem like a valuable feature but  and I'm able to maneuver and drive better in the snow with the VSC OFF.",,

The Hondas I owned were two Accords and two CRXs.  The Element has too many blind spots, the clam-shell doors begin to squeak and rattle after a while, they blow around on the road when it's windy, fuel economy is not that great and when facing a head wind decreases even more.  The windshield pillars are large enough to easily hide a mini van and even a school bus depending on position.  Vision to the sides and rear suffer the same. I took it on several long distance trips and it proved to be not comfortable.  It pitches and yaws enough to make you feel motion sickness. I eventually traded it for another Accord.",Rear tale gate can be used as a work bench.  Rugged interior can be easily cleaned.  Excellent for the dog because of rugged cleanable interior.

Real poor gas mileage for a 4 cylinder 22-24 MPG, and I am on the hwy most of the time. I would not buy another one, but it is real good to haul bicycles around; in fact, I have put 4 bikes in the back with the seats up. The thing is built like a tank, and like I said, very reliable.

Rear access is a total pain in the a@#! We probably drive 80% of the time with the rear seats stowed -- this would not be a great family car (our kids are grown and gone)2. Interesting lack of amenities on a top line model - ie., no auto unlock button on passenger door, no outside temp meter, intermittent wipers have only one speed.3.

The interior is roomier than you think.  Ride quality is rather spartan but not unexpected and the engine could use a little more hp.  Gas mileage is lousy, I'm hoping for a hybrid version.

3.75,Elementary SUV,Marco Minardo ,08/10/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,3,4,1,3,"Bought used with 30K miles. This Honda is an extremely thirsty little SUV. In town I never got better than 20 mpg, 25 mpg on the interstate at 75/78 mph without AC was achievable with Super Unleaded Fuel, otherwise 23 mpg was more the norm for such an underpowered 4 cyl. engine that otherwise is very smooth and torquey at the bottom. The transmission gearing was poor as well, shifting hard and constantly between 4th and 5th back and forth at highway speeds. The 'no carpet' floor would be a great idea if it were rubber and not that hard slippery plastic. Horrible with bugs and rocks on the windshield as well as wind noise. Worst Honda I ever owned in terms of poor performance and fuel economy. ",Very reliable and sturdy. Love the tailgate/lift gate design. Love the height. Excellent A/C which cools fast the very roomy interior. Very handy suicide 'half' doors. Excellent fit and finish. Very good and smooth over bumpy pavement.,"GAS MILEAGE! Is this a Honda or a Hummer?

Was drawn to the safety features and the 2.4 L 4 cyl, since it has a timing chain and not a belt. We use Honda's synthetic oil and put a k&n air filter in it and have gotten 29 mpg (doing 65 mph) before. Most trips we average 23-26 doing 75 though.

For the last 25 years I have bought them all (Toyota, Nissan, Ford, Subaru, Caddy...etc) but never witnessed a vehicle in this size to only tow 600 pounds? This means weak Transmission and lack of suspension support. They sure made it big enough to stuff whole garage full of stuff.  Plus the sheet sounds like it was make of coke cans.  The car is noisy and can't decide to stay in 4th or 5th gear.  From what I know, all Hondas have this problem. WEAK and noisy. AWD system does not do so well compared to my Suby.

My Element has given me a reliable and fun driving experience from day one. I've used the Element to go camping and haul all my equipment to evenings at the Drive-In theater. The AWD makes driving in the rain a breeze and I love, love, love the ride height of the Element. The water resistant seats and flooring have worked out nicely for my trips down to the beach with my 90lb dog. I enjoy my Element more and more every day and I can't wait for snow season to take the Element to the slopes for some snowboarding!!!","The all around utility of the vehicle for my active lifestyle that still allows me Honda quality and reliability.

I replaced a '04 Jetta because I wanted 4WD for the winter road conditions and I needed space to haul stuff- but did not want a pickup truck. The Element along with a lightweight aluminum trailer when needed satisfies all needs. Upon delivery from dealer, I noticed a leak of clear fluid on my garage floor... turns out it was from the rear differential, and they promptly replaced it and I've had no problems since. Feels stable in slippery conditions, and has good power. I've consistently averaged 25 mpg summer, 22 in winter.

I use my 2008 Element as a daily driver and I also sell a high-end Swedish car in my day job which I know inside and out (this will explain some of my suggestions later on). I think the Element is the perfect vehicle for me for a lot of reasons.

If you bike (we can get two road bikes with aero bars in the BACK), camp, scuba dive (just toss your gear in and hose out later) this is the winner hands down.  Most SUV's are all image, but no substance (carpet and leather seats are not advantageous to an active lifestyle). The Element delivers with Honda reliability.

I bought it to be able to haul my bikes inside instead of outside in the bed of the pickup.  The interior is functional, perfect for my needs.  The performance is terrible, bad hesitation upon acceleration.  If you need to accelerate RIGHT now, forget it.  The tires squeal on almost any sharp corner, in rain it feels unsteady, like it could hydroplane at any second. Terrible mileage (21 MPH for a 4 cylinder).  I honestly think rollover is a problem or will be soon.  The sunroof is unusable in that it is in the back and cannot be opened remotely.  ",rubber floor and stain resistant seat.

The sales person was decent and with the incentives I think it is an excellent buy for anyone looking for a small SUV with good utility uses.

The paint on the cladding chips easily.  Small gas tank means more frequent fill ups, rattles, I hate hate hate having to get out of the car to close the back windows.","Fits a lot of stuff, good in bad weather as long as snow's not too deep.

I dont care about resale value as I intend to keep this jewel for at least 10 years.  The ride is great and the 166 bhp is more than adequate power.

I looked at the CR-V and it was a bit ""fancy"" for me. I want my little truck to be a truck. I am going to fill it up with all kinds of stuff ranging from Mulch to Christmas trees. The ""wipe it clean"" interior is awesome just for that. Looking at it you would think this is about as aerodynamic as a refrigerator with the door ope. The reality is, the thing is VERY well designed. Virtually no exterior noise when cruising along at 65. Gas consumption is not at all bad considering its a truckish vehicle. Over all this is a really fun SUV and worth every penny. We love it very much. And best of all, It's a Honda!!!!  ",Hands down the completely waterproof and easy clean interior. Love how open it is. Sight lines while driving are incredible with almost no obstructed views or blind spots. Very peppy for a 4 banger and the trans shifts like a beemer. HUGE improvement painting all of the plastics on the EX.,I just spent 21K. Could I maybe get the cargo cover and rubber mat for the back? Stuff slides around a lot on the plastic spare tire deck. And maybe a few more tie down points higher up in the cargo area. Other than that it's really fun and ridiculously practical. Yikes!!! I just said practical.
4.625,In my Element,Lauren ,08/13/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"My Honda Element has exceeded expectations in nearly every category for affordable transportation.  However, if you buy an Element draw on my experience & be sure to leave the windows slightly open during the heat of the day.  Two of my windows have exploded due to heat build up in the cabin.  Honda will not warrant this condition and frankly, it's an expensive item to replace glass.  I watched in horror yesterday as the glass literally popped and fell out of the car when the car was parked in my driveway.  Sure my insurance carrier will pay, but I owe the deductible and risk higher premiums. I am disappointed that Honda isn't warranting the design flaw.  I feel very let down by the warranty","The car is fun to drive, has an European type feel.  The spaciousness of the cabin, the practical appointments and function is perfect for transporting pets and kids.  Were it not for the glass breakage problem that has me confounded and out of pocket a lot of money, I'd give a glowing report.   ","The window & fixed glass that has imploded in the heat is a  safety hazard, though it is unlikely the cabin would be occupied while parked with the windows closed.  Still,  it is not practical to leave the windows open because of rain or theft.  Allowance for contraction/expansion of glass is a must"

Being the parents of two toddlers we needed a car that could take a beating and this one looked like it could. It has delivered in spades. Our kids LOVE IT-they climb up inside themselves (we bought the side steps) and into their car seats.  I love it because I can actually stand in back to buckle them in, which means no more opening one door into oncoming traffic.  I just put them in the curbside door and climb in after them to secure them.  They also love that they sit up high and can see everything.

Ok, it's a little different from the norm, but that adds to it's appeal (in my humble opinion). The back seats that fold up on the walls, can't beat it!

It gets the sticker gas millage and a bit better.  The car is comfortable and roomy.  My daughter owns a Pacifica and claims the Element has way more leg room.  My auto insurance cam way down due to the improved safety features of the Element.,I enjoy driving this car.  It has very good pick-up if you want it.  The Element has a small turn radius.  I am very happy with the fuel consumption. It could be better but I will not complain.,The visors need extenders.  As they come from the factory they are useless.  I better radio would be nice.

Everything on the inside appears to be made to last for years and still look new.  When driving it sounds deep instead of whiny.

4.375,Love my E,wowaddict ,01/27/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,3,4,5,I love my E. It's everything I expected. If you're used to a luxury car this is not for you. This is a no frills car. But lots of fun to drive. It's a peppy little suv with tons of storage. I love the interior and the whole look of the car. The XM radio and iPod hook up are great. The seats can basically turned in to a huge bed. The gas mileage is ok not great but not bad. It's not a car so it's not fair to expect great gas mileage but for an SUV it's good.,"Where do I start. XM, iPod jack, simple interior, storage, peppy, fun to drive, the color ROOT BEER.",Seats are not the most comfortable. They are good for every day driving but those who travel a lot or drive a lot will find it tough. I would also have loved a sunroof/moonroof. The SC does not even get the back one.
5,In My Element,troydvance ,01/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Thanks to Edmunds, I chose the Honda Element!  After considerable research and test drives, the Element fit perfectly.  Since I am 6 feet 4 inches tall, I could not have found a more perfect match.  The ride is much better than the other vehicles that I looked at.  The design is very unique and utilitarian.  It gets a lot of compliments.  It is useful and well designed.  Even when the weather is below 0, the Element starts and warms quickly.  The cargo room is amazing and can hold things that I did not think it would.  It feels very stable in high winds.  It can turn on a dime and leave change.  I am very happy.  ",I have no one feature that is my favorite.  It is a thoughtfully designed vehicle that rides and handles like a dream.  ,Honda does not need to make any improvements.  It is perfect.
4.5,LOVE The Element!,mach1mustang6 ,01/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,3,5,My girlfriend purchased a used orange 2006 Element EX-P with AWD and it had every option available on it.  We both have fully enjoyed the Element.  Originally looked at the new CR-V at the time but decided to go with the Element for its versitility and durable interior.  Its fun to watch everyone look at you going down the road too especially with the orange paint job.  Very easy to keep clean and HUGE room even for people over 6ft in the back seats.  Love the interior design and simple climate control dials.  Sweet sound system and it has a great spot for your iPod to hook up to the raido on the passenger side shelf above the glove box.  The split liftgate/tailgate is a great feature too.,The rear seat configurations.  The awesome stereo system with built in factory subwoofer.  The durability of the interior and ease to keep clean.  Have not had ONE problem with it yet.,"A center console between the front seats, more than 1 power plug up front closer to the driver for my cell phone charger, a sunroof over the front seats too (not just the rear one), roll down windows for the suicide doors and not the old school flop out style, seating for 5, better MPG and HP "
5,Great Car-INSIDE  & OUTSIDE THE BOX !!,rondor ,11/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Love this car. It is fun to drive and the gas mileage is way better than my Buick SUV. It feels bigger than it really is. The leg room in the rear is unreal. You have to really see and get inside this vehile to appreciate it. The composite black panels are easy to clean and cheap to replace. No dings or scratches.,The wide doors and the rear sunroof.  I love that the rear seats can be folded against the side of the vehicle. All the cargo space. It may not be the sleekest car but it does everything right. ,Arm rests on the LX model. More fabric color choices. Center console would be nice.
4.75,Honda Element,RARosen ,10/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"As a large person I have found the selection of comfortable vehicles in any catagory lacking.  I already own a Chrysler Town & Country and wanted to replace a 2000 Dodge Stratus.  I was pleasently surprised at the physical comfort available in this car.  I can get in and out without having to duck down or hit my head.  All controls are in the right place and easy to work.  Handeling is quick and steering is responsive and the ride quality is excellent for a car of this size.  I have had the car for a little over a month and have put on 1,500 miles so I can't really comment on reliability.  Fit and finish is better that any of the cars that I have owner in the last 40 years. ",High roof and wide front doors. Clear 360 degree views.,Front seat head restraints need improvement for comfort.  No matter how I adjust the seat or restraint height my head bounces on it.  I have solved this by removing the driver's head restraint and reinstalling it backwards.
4.75,Take a Test Drive,Alien ,10/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,Took a test drive and was sold on the Element. Feels solid in all driving situations and comfortable. After 800 miles getting just over 26 mph in combined driving. Interior is a cavern. All the controls are the usual Honda quality and thoughtful placement.With the driving dynamics it feels bigger than its actual size and so car like. At 6-00 290 I am actually comfortable sitting and driving this vehicle.,"The ex stereo and XM radio. Flat floor,multiple rear seat combinations. Nice front seats. Great head room.",Picky but toss the rear sunroof and replace it with a front power moonroof. Configure the doors as a conventional 4 door. A little more power from the engine.Then we got a 10 on our hands.  
5,Always wanted one.,FXD06 ,10/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Always wanted one. Got one for it's safety and fun values. The engine does OK, does really well on the top end. Low end a little whiny. Like the interior, no blind spots. We have a car seat in the back that is a breeze to use with the room. Happy that I got one.",The roomy interior & the AWD.,Coin slots.
4.625,"So far, very good",Roman ,07/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"After choosing a black '07 AWD, I changed my mind at the last minute and got a gray '08 SC because I liked the larger wheels, projector headlights, and more civilized interior trim (carpet).   I have nothing but praise so far. It's comfortable, practical, fun and gets a lot more attention than I expected.  At times I think it's ugly, but it keeps some strange appeal in spite of it.  Great feel on the highway, weak acceleration at the light, but after 40 mph, it's a rocket.  The interior features are very well thought-out and the audio is better than my '07 Acura TL.  While the SC interior is 'softer', it remains a very utilitarian vehicle.  It's great.","The audio sounds great - subwoofer/bass are good.  High speed handling surprised me for such a tall vehicle and everything inside is well positioned.  The tilt-up, lay flat, removable rear seats give it a great dual-personality.  Mileage is ~22-25mpg in 1st 1000 miles.","Geek it up a bit with a nav system, bluetooth and more trip computer (like avg mpg).  AWD and moonroof (on SC), and you're there.  "
