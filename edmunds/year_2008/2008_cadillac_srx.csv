3.5,Lemon,apovolotski ,06/22/2013,,,4,4,1,1,,4,4,5,5,"8 months into the purchase, I begin to believe that I've got a lemon. Currently, it is broken down and has been here and there throughout the tenure.Here is the chronological order of things that broke down:1. Handle holder on the roof (the one that you hold on to to get in and out of the car) -- was hammered in -- easy fix.2. Front seat plastic backing was hanging -- clamp was off -- easy fix.3. Muffler was rumbling, weird noise level up -- clamp was off -- easy fix.4. Engine chugging -- spark plug replaced.5. Back seats rattling wildly and violently at high speeds -- wheel balancing did not solve the problem -- still rattle.6. Power steering and pump failed.7.Chugging bad","Speed & handling, when it works.","Overall mechanical redesign is needed. Substandard parts from Mexico are used throughout the vehicle, which result in both cosmetic and mechanical problems."

3.875,"Great Vehicle, Bad Transmission",wrrjr ,04/13/2011,,,4,4,4,2,,4,5,4,4,Bought the vehicle used three months ago and love the way it drives on long distances. However with only 56000 the transmission burned out all of the clutches. I had taken it to the dealer but they told me is was a computer issue. It wasn't so the out of town dealer had to completely rebuild the transmission while on vacation. Day after repair we drove it 1100 miles home without a problem. Got 22 mpg on highway at 74 mph.

For a car of this level this is totally unacceptable. I have always owned GMs but I think this might be my last, I think I will check out the Lincoln's or Acura.","Although the seals had to be replaced numerous times, I did love the Panoramic roof.","increase luggage room, better gas milage, fewer trips to the dealer.

My wife loves it and it's the only SUV cross- over that has enough room in the back to really be called an SUV. I'm more comfortable in the SRX than in my truck.

So much for consumer reports saying its unreliable. Love the SRX because it handles like a well designed car and accelerates with ease. Everything works the way its supposed to and this car has been very reliable so far. Drive way better than the V6 trucks from BMW, MB and Lexus and you will save money. Test drive this car before getting saddled to a boring vanilla vehicle recommended by consumer reports.

4.875,Love my SRX crossover,RJ ,10/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I love how this SRX handles and rides.  I test drove the Lincoln MKX which did not compare to the ride of the Cadillac SRX.  I have 6500 miles and drive six (6) hours to my cottage in Michigan.  It is a treat to drive that distance now.  The interior is gorgeous and everyone always compliments the vehicle's overall appearance.  Great job Cadillac.  The Bose sound system is like nothing I have ever experienced.  I cannot wait for winter to see how it performs with the AWD feature.  It is really a fun car to drive.  My wife loves the SRX and especially the black exterior I chose.,Bose sound system.

This time, I purchased instead of leasing so I drove everything, BMW, Volvo, Maxda, Acura and settled on the SRX. I couldn't be happier, the ride is beautiful, the inside ""top notch"" not like the Enclave which was my first choice after I traded the Buick Rendezvous.  Rear seat leg room better than any car I test drove.  I am 6 feet tall and the vehicle is very, very comfortable all the way around.

I hate Infinity and I can never see eye to eye with the German companies.  I decided to look at the Cadillacs. No way I was buying one, but I looked anyway. The test drive was fantastic. After much internal agonizing, I went back. There were large rebates in play and they had exactly what I was looking for. I pulled the trigger! I have never enjoyed a vehicle more. Wonderful engineering, beautiful fit and finish and a great stereo system. It has it all, size, comfort, power and a wonderful 50/50 weight distribution.

You pay for what you get and this vehicle I suppose sums that up.  Nice on the outside and inside I suppose but the drive and the handling .. appalling.  Why is it American cars only drive well on a straight flat roads?  Here in Europe we have no such thing and can't you tell with this car.  Had an X5 and a Range Rover Sport before .. and now I know why.  Nevermind .. it does look nice on the drive .. but that's about it.  When will Americans ever build .. a decent car?
