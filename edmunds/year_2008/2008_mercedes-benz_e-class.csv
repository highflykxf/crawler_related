5,What an awesome machine,Hila ,10/11/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"This is my first review I ever write on any car. I have owned more than a dozen sports car throughout my life, and I bought my 08 Mercedes E63 AMG 2 years ago. Until now, the power of this car still surprises me. I have owned more than 4 BMW M cars, until my first MB car before this one, which was the 1999 E55 AMG. I must say that I originally bought my E55 based on a good deal solely (my previous M car had really drained me and I took a loss when I sold it), and I did not know much about these cars, as all BMW fans will tell you, MB is a ""Grandpa"" car (nothing close by the way), but I was also just sick of pouring endless money in my 04 BMW M3 (within 6 months it was driven 3000miles only with more than 4k$ in repairs, and not once tracked). I took that E55 monthly to the drift track for more than a year, expecting it to fail at any moment, and drove the car to an astounding 287,xxx miles, with ALL components remaining stock expect for the water pump. The car was so reliable and with so much power, but it was time to upgrade as the body style was getting old, that is when I finally decided to upgrade to the w211 model. And man,  was I surprised, it is like a somebody stuffed an angry a T-Rex under the bonnet. Superb acceleration, and brute force, I have taken out, from a full stop, more than 3 Lambos (Gallardo I should say), countless Maseratis and the likes by just pushing on the gas. Forget the power, but the styling is great, and the massive 6.3L naturally aspirated was more attractive to me than all the turbo systems they introduced in their later models, or superchargers before. I cannot stress how comfortable this car is, and if you control yourself enough to drive it normally (which is very hard with the engine rumble and people wanting to challenge you all the time), it is surprisingly good on gas at more than 25mpg on highway. I have to mention couple of things though, as all MBs, the AC vents just do not follow your command, it just blows sporadically across all vents (I had that same problem with E55, although not as noticeable), but I also heard of this with most MB owners I have met (I guess cooling is not a priority in Germany, but man we're in Texas, it would be nice to have Gulf Specs cars here (Gulf specs are cars that are sold in places like Dubai for example, and they come with bigger Radiators, compressors, water pump.... to deal with the desert heat), especially because mine is Black on Black. I noticed a big difference in cooling when I drove one there, the oil temperature would not bulge over 100c, while here it routinely goes to 113c, driving normally, with more temperate weather. Also, although my E55 had 287,xxx miles in the end before I sold it, the suspension was still stock !! Yes, stock. All bushings, control arms... except for the shocks, were stock and surprisingly holding pretty well after years of driving and putting more than 70k miles on the car. The w211 seems to have more sensitive suspension, I'm not sure if this is because of the air-shocks, that put more strain on the suspension for the sake of your comfort, or just the brute force that this car puts into action, you feel like the front end is going to lift in the air. Also, everybody that lives in Houston knows what kind of obscenity they call roads here, really embarrassing, but most of my bushings were nearing the end of their lives at 68,xxx miles which not a lot. These are the only draw backs I have noticed so far, but it will take a lot more to get me off this car, and I am planning to keep driving it past my old one and more.",,

I was very disappointed. Burning smell coming from vents, car shifts strange, non-digital dual climate control, cheap interior, dash is not bright, no H.I.D headlights for 60k, Navigation is Not user friendly.  Cruise control gets mistaken for turn signal.  Too many unnecessary features. Does not ride as good as my 05 lexus.

My neighbors called them because of a large gas spill underneath my car. Got it towed, fixed, in a week - the same story. Fixed, then the check engine light went on. Upgraded software - tranny started ""jump"" shifting from the second gear to the first. Long story short, out of 6 months 3k mi of ownership I spent 8 weeks driving Hyundai offered by local MB dealership.

Very smooth shifting vehicle.  This is my 3rd Mercedes, by far the best (previous was an '83 300td (junk), e300 (pretty good).  I have owed Lexus (IS300) and 5 series BMW and like this better.  Many other vehicles along the way and this is the best.  Package 2 with keyless go, fold down rear seat and the full moon roof.  19 miles one way to work, mostly freeway with some stop and go downtown and I see 36 mpg routinely.  Not a big NAV user but have found this nav system to be a challenge.  Logic is not intuitive but you do figure it out with some focused effort.   ",Keyless go.  Overall ride quality (excellent suspension for everyday driving on our crumbling infrastructure).  Full length moonroof.  Fold down seats (my road bike fits nicely when you remove the front wheel).  Scale / dimensions of the car is right for me.  Stereo is pretty good too.,"Nav is a bit weak.  Rest of the car is sterling.  This is a luxury sedan, not a sports car but I would like a little better cornering capability (tends to be a little ponderous in hard cornering).

4.75,The Right  Decison Afterall,Eric Dise ,05/02/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I tinkered around with moving to a car from a SUV for several years. I began looking at Infiniti's, Lexus's, BMW's, and even Porsche's. The main draw of the E350 was the 4Matic feature. I am a work-aholic and don't like to miss work due to weather. After I found one at a local dealer, I took it out for a spin. Oh my, was it impressive. I loved the looks. I loved the power. I loved the comfort and fit. It was smooth and powerful. The seats are very supportive. The tranny is smooth and agile and the ride is perfection! After only months of ownership I am convinced I made a great choice.

However, I expect a great experience!","4 Matic (insurance for bad weather), Sports package, iPod, fantastic Harmon Kardon sound system, seat heaters, and manumatic.",The navigation system is not as easy to use as other cars I've owned.

This is my first Mercedes and am nothing but impressed with the E350.  The ride is very luxury like although it does have some sport mixed in too. Interior is comfortable with very supportive front seats and a rear seat that is acceptable for two people. The nav system (although an older design) is still easy to use and is functional. All switchgear is top rate and the wood trim looks expensive but not over done. Even though the seats are MB tex they still look like leather and feel great. Would purchase another Mercedes.  ,"Would really say a lot of things I like about the car..interior comfort and quality, ride, handling, fit and finish and really most everything about the car.

Also the glove box is rather small.

Difficult to use and I dont need to find ""border crossings"" in the USA. Just buy a Garmin, a 100 times better. Problems: transmission tends to clunk into lower gear as you slow down.

BMW are very sporty by nature, but the interior lacks luxury and the iDrive doesn't help. Audi's interior are first rate, but the performance lags behind most of its competitors. The E350 is accelerates smooth and swiftly, and the engine is also extremely responsive. It also incorporates everyday practicality.

Wife liked the looks of the E, I liked the drive of both, but the E is hands down better looking. Sure, the GS is more reliable, but given my experience with the TL and Consumer Report's raving about that, who knows what to believe, and my brother in law's E has been flawless, as has been our CLK, which we kept.  If the E is anything like our CLK, I'm sure we made the right choice. Nice design, solid. Very pleasant.","Overall driving impression; turning radius is great (Acura was horrible), Safety; a pleasure to drive; 7 speed tranny; at first the clock in the instrument panel bugged me, but now I use it all of the time and like it; insurance through AAA actually wasn't that bad.","Bluetooth should be standard.

I got the Sport Package, which stiffens the ride a bit, but not as harsh as the BMW. I've only had it for a week or so, but fuel economy is good (not great) and the handling is stupendous for a Benz.

It is comfortable, and well, so intelligent. When going downhill and gathering speed, the engine doesn't upshift, when braking, the engine slows too. It pulls you through curves. Our MPG is better than advertised. ","Comfort, performance and iPod integration",I like the passenger side exterior mirrow that tilts down while in reverse- too bad they stopped that. Hard drive navigation & bluetooth compatability w/o needing to buy the puck would be nice- I hear that will be standard in 2009 models.
4.875,I Love It,uscplaya ,06/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The minute the car was driven into my garage by the dealership I was blown away. Next to the 2008 black M6 and even the cl550, the E63 is absolutely beautiful. Interior styling beautiful, simple, functional and elegant. Idrive is outdated and difficult to figure out, especially when you have different models of BMW. I Love the analog clock next to the speedo, even more so than the faux television screen display on the cl. AMG rocks over the M, just listen to the exhaust.","Ipod controls on the wheel. Analog clock, information display interface on the steering wheel, Teleaid. ",Put a low power fuel economy mode on it like the M cars.
5,The Car I Always Wanted,SLCFBP ,06/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my first MB, the 350 AWD, fully loaded, in Nov. 2007. I have now driven 6K and nothing about this car has disappointed. I have not had a single problem or needed to take it in other than for the 1K complimentary check. Everything works, everything fits. I for one find the oft critisized Command system just fine though the GPS in my part of world (Southwest) seems to lose mapping capability much more than my wife's GPS in her Highlander. The MB is a dream on the long stretches, has the best soundproofing & a perfect stereo to match of any car I have owned. I have truly found the car of my dreams - I may never change brands again.","Build quality and optional gimmicks. Safety features. Quietness and sound system. Finally a comfortable driving position for my 6'4"", 250 lb frame! Engine smoothness and responsiveness. Ride smoothness. ",GPS too often not cutting it compared to others I have used/am using. Would be nice to have the iPod info on the command screen instead of the info center. Backseat space crammed for big persons.
4.875,Glad I Chose The Merc,Tom M ,06/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just recently bought an E350 4Matic. Before this, I had an Audi A6 3.2, which was fantastic in the snow. This is just as good. I love the incredibly smooth ride, the huge glass roof, and the timeless look of the car. A few things though I'm a little disapointed with. In my A6, on mostly the highway, I was averaging 32MPG. In this, about 24. Not as good as I hoped. A fun feature is being able to fold the rear headrests down from the front (especially if ppl in the back are sleeping) but they are very uncomfortable when they are up and theres no button to raise them once they are down(Annoying). Overall, the car is beautifully well done, but I think a facelift is needed sometime soon.","Smooth ride, navigation system (actually works), glass roof, mood lighting, 4matic, huge trunk. I like how it's the last Mercedes with a standing hood ornament, and roomy interior. Timeless. Truly a great companion on an arduous commute. ","The 'function over form' headrests, way too much chrome in the front, more than expected body roll in the bends, less than expected fuel economy, and why not be able to have the bluetec diesel with 4matic all wheel drive? "
4.625,Take the family in style,Dan flynn ,06/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"My E350 wagon was just broken in and it is such a smooth and refined family vehicle. The suspension is stiff, however the ride remains composed and luxurious. The car handles so well you forget the car weighs over 4000 lbs and it is actually fun to drive for a station wagon. It's not fast, however it has plenty of power for easy around town and highway driving. The driver's seat is so comfortable and piloting this Benz is truly a pleasure and a big step up from my previous Audi A6 Avant. It also gets decent 25 mpg while crusing at about 75-80 mph.(much better than EPA's 21 mpg estimate)","Build quality, refinement, luxury, standard 4MATIC AWD for excellent handling and grip in dry and wet weather","A little more power for a V6 wouldnt hurt, and why no sport package for the wagon?"
4.75,Worth the extravagant price,newyorker ,05/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"This was a perfect buy even though the 65k total cost is excessively priced. The car has utility, style, power, comfort, safety and AWD making it the most practical car my family has ever ridden in. The E350 wagon is one of the very few cars that has utility for a whole family w/ luggage and the ride quality of a sport sedan. 4MATIC is very grippy and 3.5L V6 is powerful and sounds very classy when revved up. While it's no gas guzzler, I average 18 mpg wherever I go and that's not exactly great considering premium fuel can cost over $4 a gallon. But the car is so comfortable and the driver's post is excellent. Piloting this car is truly a pleasure. Styling is gorgeous! ","4matic is flawless in any weather condition. COMAND navi system works great when you get the hang of it. The suspension is tuned sharply enough for good handling, yet soft enough for a smooth cruise. Feels very solid and tank like also.","A little expensive, but I understand its worth it. Low mpg in both city and highway"
4.875,A true sports sedan,Alex ,04/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Best part of this car on my first drive was, compare to E320 and E500 ( both I owned before) how stable this drive train is. Solid grip feel and very stable with no rocking motion side to side. surefooted to road. Engine sound make you want to drive around the town more, and it becomes very addictive. Engine is remarkably responsive and with slight touch of the acceleartor car takes off leaving other cars behind the back mirror. Its totally effortless. No wonder with that much power. Nothing like E500 I had, much more responsive. ","Agressvie looks, fast, responsive, very stable at high speed, sure foot feeling, excellent brakes.",
5,The Greatest E class,Best E-class  ,04/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I two weeks ago I traded in my 2006 E350 for the 2008 E350. The handling and engine sound are much improved and there is more aviable options and combinations. I got my E350 with dvd navigation, premium 2 pkg, ipod integration, electronic trunk closer,voice control, and keyless go. The color is Sienna Black metallic which reflects red but appears to be black and the sahara/beige interior ( very nice combination). It had a MSRP or 60,500 and had a sticker price lower than a E550. I am delighted.","Ipod integration, voice control, and keyless go, voice control, Ipod integration. These are the best but the rest are grat and i have had no problem with this one or with my previous E-class.","Front headrest's should be like the E550, although these aren't bad."
4.875,Almost Perfect,beatlemaniacs ,03/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Leased this car after leasing an '05 E500 4matic. Like this car almost as much as predecessor. The 350 is missing a few features of the E500. Opted not to get the E550, but why does the E350 not come with the passenger rear view mirror tilt when in reverse, and also the trunk lock button? Also, they stripped the digital hvac function down to the old dials. Finally, the iPod system is disappointing. Why in the year 2008 it doesn't route through the COMAND like the satellite radio, navigation and regular radio is beyond me. It's way too clunky right now. Hopefully, they will address this in future models just to catch up with Ford and Nissan electronics.","Design, silver color, black interior, ride, ample power.","It is the digital age. Should be fully integrated with iPod, all mp3 and USB ports for audio as standard. It's not high-tech and it shouldn't cost hundreds and hundreds. Kommen sie hier, Mercedes!"
4.375,E-Class Not a Real E Class,Viyes ,03/15/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,4,4,5,"Traded in my fully loaded 2002 BMW X5 for a 2008 E350W. Should not compare apples to oranges. First Impression : After few weeks of driving the E Class, corner of my heart the BMW wins. As the saying goes, when you don't have it anymore is you will miss it even more. ","Gas mileage to horsepower is great. Dual power heated front seats. Short turning radius, 6CD/MP3 player/Sirius/GPS System, Ipod hookup, Bluetooth. Slow speed engine rpm and quietest I have ever driven","The handrest is in such an ackward position even for 5'10"" driver,hits the rite elbow while getting in & out. sometimes it's so hard & I almost missed my heartbeat.

5,Best Mercedes I've ever owned.,Ray in NH ,02/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have owned one ML, two C-Class, four E-Class, two SL-Class,and two S- Class.  This is the best all-round Mercedes I have owned. (The best best was the 1997 S-600).  This car is faster than most sedans, and the engine is really really quiet.  No one who drives with me knows it is a diesel.  I tell them it is a diesel after I snap their head back while getting on the highway.  Most people don't know that while driving in 'comfort' mode, the car leaves a stopped position in second gear because of the high tourque level in this vehicle.  ","First, I have averaged 32.5 mpg over 28,000 miles.  I was getting 19mpg in the E500 4-Matic that I traded.  I like the MB tex standard because I often have my large Autralian Shepard with me.  Just wipe clean.  Normally the passengers are limited to my wife and me and the dog, plenty of room.","4-Matic; sport suspension; increased body clearance option.  Most new E-Class vehicles on the road in New England are 4-Matic.  Combine the 4-Matic with the high mileage and  comfortable ride, this car should hit the ball out of the park.  "
4.875,Having a blast,new owner ,01/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I am enjoying the Mercedes experience with this car the ride and handle are second to none. The car design is well thought out as well as comfortable,Sport package a must. The interior is very nice and comfortable love the feel of the wood wheel. At 80 -90 mph car feels like it's going 55,Must get used to turn signal location vs the cruise control. Keep using the cruise as the turn signal
4.625,2008 E550 4MATIC - Class Personified,MaxVike ,01/20/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,3,5,"Just turned in my 2004 E500 4MATIC for a 2008 E550 4MATIC.  The '08 is demonstrably better in virtually every category...build quality, tightness, ride, speed, just overall quality.  Mine is black on black with Premium 2, Panoramic Roof, electronic trunk closer, iPOD integration, 6CD, sport package, wood steering wheel, window shades...virtually everything you can get.  Hate the standard, and the sport wheels, upgraded to the 18"" Mekbuda wheels; added chrome window sill, chrome door handle inserts, and chrome headlight rings.  The car is stunningly beautiful.  I have had many nice cars, however, I have received more compliments on this car than I could have imagined. Great car!","Engine is smooth and powerful.  Panoramic roof.  Sirius and iPOD integration.  Heated and ventilated seats, window shades.","Find a way to raise the NAV screen.  Would like tighter sports suspension.  Also, the standard wheels are impossible to keep clean.  "
4.875,Best of series,David ,01/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have owned several Mercedes, most recently C280 and then an E320. The E350 4-matic is the run away best. From the outset, it has a better ride, firmer integrity, and high comfort. In some ways it has moved  closer to S-class feel and ride -- not all the way.  The interior seems much roomier than my previous 2003 E320, even though the specs are only a bit roomier. The additional of 4-matic has been awesome (for me in the Midwest), comparable to the moving power of my spouse's ML in snowy conditions.  I look forward to trips -- I added iPod integration and the sound is totally amazing  resembling fixed speakers. Sound far exceeds radio/satellite radio. iPod control on wheel is a bit tricky.","Map function is so improved over previous versions. It's actually usable. Totally helpful in unfamiliar locales with variable map scales. Works well passively, meaning I do not need to be pushing buttons repeatedly.","The navigation would be better if it were a touch screen rather than side-button control. Car radios need the equivalent of a digital video recorder, backing up on on a radio station to re-hear something missed. "
4.25,New Owner,torontomichael ,11/22/2007,,,4,5,5,4,,4,4,4,4,"Braking noise & quirks have been completely resolved from earlier E models. In fact,braking is excellent in terms of both ""feel' & response at any speed including into curves. Steering has now a really nice degree of response at both high/low speed.

The ride is incredibly smooth, Nav is good as is the radio. If price is a consideration ask the dealer for an ""RDR"" car. ",The ride is fantastic. ,"Put REST feature back in. It was a great cold weather feature as it passed residual engine heat for 30 minutes with the car off.
