4.875,The S63 is the best combination of comfort and speed in one machine,riosouza ,08/04/2014,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5," The S63 is the best combination of comfort and speed in one machine, period. It has so much power on ""S"" mode that if it wasn't for the traction control it would be hard to keep it straight. It's like being on a Cadillac with the feeling of a high end sports car when you hit the gas pedal. I drive my S63 daily, and the comfort makes me slow down and enjoy the ride. Then when I got an idiot tailgating me, I just hit the gas for few seconds and he disappears on my rear view mirror. If you go for a test drive, you will buy it..."," It's well built, and where most of other companies would use cheap chromed plastic, the S63 has metal, such as buttons.

I have owned it for about a year and have put 12K on it with no major complaints other than the following: 1) Coolant Level warning light, 2) ABS warning light, 3) noisy front end suspension noises.I believe the first two items are simple computer error causing the warning lights to illuminate having checked the coolant level and braking system with no signs of being too low or malfunctioning respectively.The annoying noises are a mystery. Is the air suspension? Is it rocker arms or bushings? Any feedback and recommendations would be appreciated.",,

I use Distronic plus (Adaptive cruise control stop-go) 99% of the time. Takes some understanding and becomes easier to use with time. The car drives me to work stress free, all i do is steer.

5,The Paradigm of Luxury,Ross McCullen ,01/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I knew the S600 was perfect when I was at my local Mercedes Benz dealership, here in Houston. My wife loved it and the kids (8 and 16) love it also. (My teen girl really enjoyed the vanity mirrors), while it was nearly impossible getting my son out of the reclining rear seats. My wife enjoyed the fact that she could read and drive (I would never commend this action) in stop-and-go traffic due to the very intuitive Distronic Plus System. The COMMAND system was overwhelmingly easy and the car overall was extremely comfortable. I have owned a Jaguar XJ Super V8 and a 2003 Bentley Arnage, but they pale in comparison to this big Benz, due to the way it effortlessly combines luxury and technology","The Nappa seats (the best I have ever experienced, by far) COMMAND, Distronic Plus, rear reclining seats, ABC, smooth V12 engine,and the impressive, not polarizing looks.",Can you really improve a perfect car? 
4.875,Almost Perfect Sedan,Vincent Wong ,07/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"As a total package, the 2008 S550 sets itself apart from all the super luxury sedans under $100K. I've owned many performance cars: CL500, Porsche 911's, BMW 7 series, Lexus LS430 etc.. The S550 by far is the most comfortable and pampering vehicle in its class. It has a perfect balance (through purposeful engineering) between performance and comfort - it's a well appointed family room on wheels. I'm in total agreement with MB's design philosophy: understated luxury as it is a true way to reflect the owner's sophisticated taste without overstating his/her presence. The S550 is a remarkable automobile.","Interior, voice commands, keyless go, iPod integration, Bluetooth, Parktronics and most of all the V8 engine.",Use Michelin tires instead of the noisy Continentals.

5,The best car I have  ever owned,Dr Ted ,06/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have owned many new cars incuding 9 new Sclass mercedes. I purchased a new 2007 through  my local dealers European delivery program. What a blast. The hotels they were incredible. But the hotels paled in comparison to driving the new S Class on the Autobahn. My wife and I both  loved that car so much that the following year we went back to Germany and got another one. Well you guessed  we are going  back for our third one in August 2009. As long as Mercedes keeps making  a car of this quality with such a high retained value I am In.,"Styling, handling, and performance, plus incredible comfort","Let  it run faster on the Autobahn for European delivery cars only, it's governed at 130."
4.375,"Good Car, Not Thrilled, But Good Car",ibitty ,06/11/2008,,,4,4,5,4,,5,4,4,5,"This is a very beautiful car.  Not the best, but nice.  Really the best on the market right now, but not sure that says a lot.  S550 best of a choice for the current market when compared to the Quattroporte, 7 Series, A8.  Cars I wish it came close too, the driving feel and comfort of my 2001 740iL or the elegance of my 2006 Range Rover.   I have had it to the shop twice for TPMS and a tire that kept going flat.","The bottom of the front seat that extends out.  I have long legs, what a simple but wonderful feature.","Side mirrors are too small.  Passenger side mirror does not tint at night and while the tilt in reverse is a great feature, the tilt then turn out renders it useless. Ventilated seats sounded wonderful, too bad no air comes through the holes."
4.625,Super Sedan,walter ,06/02/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I had this car for a 7months. This car has the best utilization for a super car. I considered Porsche 911 turbo, Audi R8, and Ferrari F430, but with a family, those cars are unacceptable. Considered Alpina B7 but, shaky reliability and it being non-factory car, I disqualified it from my list. I  opted for S65 AMG for performance and 4 door convenience. I have not regretted choosing this over Porsches or Ferraris. Until Porsche Panamera or Ferrari comes with a four door sedan, this car has no competition. Plus reliability wise, MB is a far better choice. For now, this is the only choice for supersedan.","Great performance for its size. There are no compromise and this is by far the heaviest accelerating machine I have seen. Unless Ferrari can build a sedan that outperform F430, this is the best performance sedan. I had E55 AMG and older M5. They were good but, lacked comfort.","Gas mileage is a disfunction which is not neccessarily considered for this price range and category but, it is dreadful. Noise level is quite high for ultra luxury sedans. Muffler jidders and rattles a bit too much in acceleration. "
4.75,Second S550 ... first 4matic,doublet ,04/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I just traded in my 2007 S550 (bought March 2006) with 24,000 miles on a new 4matic with almost every option (list $107k).  Obviously I loved my 2007, or would not have bought the 2008.   There is a big difference in both the driving and mileage of this one versus my 07. The new one is both 4matic and has the AMG appearance package. It drives more like a BMW, but gets much less gas mileage than the 2 wheel version. By the way, my old one had no reliability issues during the 2 years of ownership.","Ride, power, back-up camera, looks of AMG ground effects, GPS",I think that they should offer the S350 stateside. Their online link system often does not answer and often the people don't know the answer.  Must call dealer service dept for answer.  I now cancel the link after the free year runs out.

I can't truly comment on reliability yet since its still a new car. But so far no problems. The drive and the features of the car are great! Plenty of power for everyday driving. If you're a racer, you should be looking at AMG models.  Gave the fuel economy an 8. It drinks gas like water, but not uncommon for V8. Think there is definite room for improvement though. Cross shopped against BMW 7 series. Choose this model due to the 7 series getting a model revision very soon.",Nappa leather is ultra luxurious (but worried about wear and tear). Keyless go rocks. ,Range indicator (like to know how much miles I can still drive!)  Naming rules for Navigation (annoying having to classify as home/work only).

4.75,MB Quality is Back,Review by Owner ,12/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"After having a couple of MBs with quality issues we are extremely pleased with the rock solid, problem- free S550 we have now had for several months and 3,000 miles. We waited 6 months to get an S with the ABC option but ABC provides such a great combination of ride and handling that it was worth it. COMMAND is very easy to use (I have never opened the manual) and allows for a dash that is free of button clutter (particularly compared to Lexus LS). You can get gas mileage well into the 20's on the highway but it can degrade to below 15 mpg in urban driving.  But you feel so great in this vehicle that you hate to have to get out when you reach your destination","Way the car soaks up bumps and ruts without the soft, floaty ride epitomized by Lexus LS. COMMAND and nav system.  Great acceleration, steering, breaks and curve hugging. Heated steering wheel option.",Add video/DVD option for rear seat. Make lumbar support control more flexibible on basic seats (cannot adjust height on back seat)
4.75,Review By Owner,FLFX ,09/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Much better in in aspects then my 04 S430. By far the best under 100k Luxury Sedan. The car adapts to your driving style! How the new Consumer Reports can rate the Lexus LS higher is beyond me. It takes a bit to get used to the new COMAND, yet after that you will never want to go back to plastic push buttons again. How on earth could anyone think the controls are difficult to use, unless they never used a computer mouse in their lifetime. I am picky and looked at all in this class, and very satisfied with my purchase.  European Luxury Sedans just have better road feel than the Japanese. The S Class has more steel interior parts than Lexus LS & is just a better handling car.","Interior materials, ease of controls, voice command, seats, trunk closer, auto closing doors, engine power, sound system.

5,Truly the Best,Barbara ,07/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My husband has been a Mercedes-Benz afficianado for decades but I have always bought whatever car I thought looked the best, which has led me to Audi and BMW many times over the years. Those vehicles were very enjoyable to own but were hopelessly unreliable. I just purchased a new car following my husband's advice (he has an S550 himself) and have never been this pleased with a car.  The S is so refined and luxurious I can hardly fathom how I lived without it all this time. This truly is the best luxury sedan available today. So far it is completely problem free and it has that bank vault solidity to it, I am so enamored with this car.","Wonderfully comfortable seats, spacious trunk, electronics that are easy for me to use, effortless power, beautiful cabin design, all the luxury I could ever want in a single car",Gas mileage is simply atrocious and the small exterior mirrors can make certain situtations difficult
4.625,Rumbling gas guzzler,Chuck Sutnick ,07/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"New for '08, it's exhaust is tuned to rumble. It's too noisy on acceleration, and constantly hums in the rear compartment.  I have an '07 S550 which gets 26.6 mpg on the highway. This S63 gets 18 mpg if you keep the speed at 70. Otherwise, mileage drops dramatically. Acceleration is awesome. The car starts out as a jack rabbit and turns into a missle. Before you know it, you're doing 60 mph in a 30 speed zone, and 90 in a 65. The interior is a superb improvement over the last generation. The dash is beautiful. The COMAND has 4 ways to get to a function making it user friendly.","Ride dynamic multi-contour seats are awesome. They bolster you on turns.ABC keeps the car level on turns. The audio system sounds great, and offers AM/FM/WB radio, CD, MP3 memory slot, Sirius satellite radio, and iPod itegration kit.  You have it all!

I havn't been able to pull the 4.5 sec.0-60 times reported, only able to get it to 6.3 (ironic) but I am not a professional driver and haven't managed to time my shifts correctly yet. Either way the car is a blast to drive.",Drive active seats keep you and your passenger planted in your seats during spirited driving while being massaged.
