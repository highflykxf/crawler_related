4.875,Under the radar,j_az ,08/25/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is just amazing!  The Engine is fierce, 420hp from a normally aspirated 5 liter V8.  I love this car because only a handful of people know what this car is and everyone else just assumes it's just another Lexus, that's fine with me because it keeps me under the radar, but when the occasional person in the know sees the car, jaws drop! The exhaust note is also intoxicating.  8 spd tranny is fantastic. I have owned Audis and VWs with their dual clutch trannys which i can say honestly are the best I have ever driven, but the Lexus does not come up short here.  Interior is well designed.  Steering wheel feels a tad thin for me and the leather is just too soft.  ","Engine, Styling, transmission and reliability.","Tougher leather, Thicker steering wheel, a bit more bass from ML sub and a little bit more HP."
4.875,M3-Killer,Louie ,11/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Great Car, especially the USB color. I drive it daily and love it.  Seems a little heavy during stop and go traffic. A real head turner everyone loves that car. No regrets, no problems as of yet. Love the fact that it's a Toyota and don't have to worry about all the issues with euro cars.","Mark Levinson Stereo, Nav, Transmission, Acceleration, Looks","AWD, and better tires for all weather driving that last more than 14k. Also the Speakerphone bluetooth thing kinda blows, people say I sound like I'm under water!"
5,This thing is a BEAST!,KT ,09/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've driven a lot of sports cars and this is among the most fun. I tried the M3/5 and the AMG and just preferred the way the IS-F is tuned. It is a lot more like a muscle car than the M's and I guess I'm just not a Mercedes guy. Plus, with Lexus, I don't have to worry about all the reliability issues of the Germans.  Love the grunt, the automatic is buttery smooth and the manual mode is actually decent (from a diehard straight drive fan). Don't understand people whining about the ride. This is a SPORTS car, and it's actually not even that bad for a sports car. Plus I can get 25-27 easily on the highway, 28 if I try hard. Overall an awesome car. Would like ventilated seats, but small gripe.","Drivetrain is superb. Sound system good. Fuel economy awesome for what it is. I never see any on the road and, accordingly, this car gets tons of attention. Low profile enough, but mean looking enough to stand out.",Ventilated seats would be nice for us southerners. Maybe a HUD. 
5,More bang for your buck than BMW m3,IS-F for life = ) ,08/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is the best car I have ever owned and driven. This car came standard with all options including navigation etc.  Extremely reliable, and with cruise control on when driving on the open road, I averaged 29.8 mpg while going 70mph  which is impressive for a v-8 sports car even if you don't like the brand. I paid 54,000 for my car which came with everything, and compared to the legendary BMW m-3 which cost over 71,000 and only came with heated leather seats and nothing else standard! Lexus is more bang for your buck! Never owned a Lexus before, but this is great!","Love the second air intake that opens at 3600 rpm, and overall styling. It looks unique, and you don't have to look like everyone else in a BMW or Mercedes. Seats keep you in place and are highest quality leather I have had in my cars as a non-rich person.","A little more leg space for everyone in car would be great, but it is still good even with me being 6'3."
5,Great Car!!!!!!!!!!!!,HC ,06/15/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have been driving this car for 3 months now, I have to say that I'm really impressed with gas mileage, HWY 26mpg, CITY 18mpg for a 400+ hp is really good, ride comfort is not bad, I live in The Woodlands TX and we have no bumpy roads which makes it a pretty smooth ride so far... The Power is amazing, really fast, and also very good looking. If you are looking for POWER and LUXURY this is the car for you. ","Power, luxury",None so far.
4.75,Not bad on first try,malujerry ,04/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I'm writing this review after 2 months of having it.  I was debating between the M3 and this, but after reviewing reliability histories and the true price difference AFTER options, I decided on taking a gamble on Lexus's new fastest car.  This car is almost the perfect balance between a race car and daily driver, it is almost perfect for being noticeable, but yet not so noticeable, and quite frankly can be either boring or crazy fun, depending on your mood. To sum it up, I have very little regret over this purchase and unless it's a Bentley, Lambo, or Ferrari next to me on the road, I never feel ""shown up.""","Engine and the sound when the 2nd intake opens up, standard features and almost everything in the optional navigation system, and the almost too aggressive exterior styling. ","Bigger car (or just make it a coupe), manual transmission, side-by-side instead of stacked rear exhaust=diffusers and a more aggressive ""sport"" mode (like open that second intake and produce more low-end power on demand)."
4.875,First sports sedan,malujerry ,03/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is great.  I was leaning towards the M3, but the huge price difference and reliability, along with a test drive, made me choose the ISF.  I would not have gone with another car within the same class. ","I love how almost every option is standard. The seats are great, rims are hot, and pushing the engine to the limit while in sport mode should be illegal! The roar on this is addictive and intoxicating, but only when needed - which is the way it should be.","Minor issues- Put real quad exhausts, manual transmission, easier to use navigation, better voice-recognition software.  Major issue - this car definitely needs better ride quality. "
4.875,Best super sedan for the money,micaISF ,01/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Pros: stupid fast. Excellent handling, very predictive and sure footed. Excellent build quality. Comfortable cabin for a sports car. Lexus quiet on smooth pavement. Extremely fast gear changes with manual mode. Powerful brakes. Very well equipped with little nonsense options. Excellent fuel economy for v8.  Cons: steering a bit too firm at low speed. Car is a bit heavy and not as tossable as a small sports car. Mark Levinson is mediocre in quality.  Ergonomics is not as intuitive as Acura/ Honda. Automatic transmission is a bit sluggish unless switched to manual mode. Loud cabin on rough surface or when under wide open throttle.",416 horses. Super fast transmission (manual mode). Ultra powerful brakes. Build quality. Quiet cabin (at least on smooth pavement).,Audio system ergonomics. More aggressive automatic transmission in sports mode.

4.625,I got a kid but I still like to drive,domino ,12/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I spent the first 45 years of my life single and without any kids.  I've driven everything from Vipers, to Jags, a host of AMGs, not to mention 1 Aston Martin.  I thought about dropping the amount of money for an M5 but then I thought, I have a little girl.  I need to spend the money on her.  I decided on the IS-F.  I drive it daily, like a normal person with my family and like a maniac when I'm alone. So far no problems and nothing but sheer fun.  I wish the Lexus people had thought to put adjustable shocks in it to dampen the ride when necessary but oh well.  I can always get new kidneys when I'm 80.","Insane power, thru a wide range of the engine.  Love the 8 speed tranny and the fit and finish of the whole car.",Adjustable damping on the shocks.

The ride is a bit firm for rougher chip roads (which we have a lot of here in New Zealand) but the electronics are faultless, the bellow of the car great and it does all that I hoped it would do - I am a Lexus convert!","Sound, stereo, it's go-go-go.",Adjustable suspension please.

I bought this car b/c never had super sedan from Toyota (also I had modified supra). Advantage - ownership cost cheaper, better reliability, better fuel economy than M3 and C63. Disadvantage - resale value lower than M3 (not C63) even though ""exclusive IS-F"", M3 and C63 are more fun to drive, better build quality, and better handling than IS-F.

4.5,"Thank you, Lexus!",Nightspore68 ,10/23/2008,,,5,2,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I was going to settle for a 335 coupe and out of desperation for a more exciting ride I test drove the M3, but I, too, was very disappointed with it. I actually preferred the 335. Not sure I wanted to spend 50k on a car I didn't love I consulted a friend who suggested the new Lexus. My wife had been trying to get me to look at Lexuses, but they're not exactly renowned drivers' cars. Anyway I drove the IS350 (which I liked a lot) then the IS-F. I bought the IS-F on the spot. What a great car! The torque, the engine sound, even the automatic transmission was great (in manual mode it can shift really fast). The Mark Levinson stereo is light years beyond anything I've ever heard from Bose.","Mark Levinson stereo, Sport mode, 27 mpg on interstate, torque","Ventilated seats, coupe version, HD radio, multi-disc shuffle, HDCD decoding, manual transmission option, more accurate navigation software, real quad exhaust, white paint option."
4.875,2008 IS F Review,LexusISF_Rocks ,09/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I had a 2005 Corvette with the Z51 package, and I loved the torque. However, I had it for 3 years, and I needed a change. Test drove a 2008 BMW M3 with the new 4.0, and it was a dog. I was very disappointed, as I really wanted to get it. It is not designed for folks that like torque. The Lexus has more torque and is much more fun to drive, especially when the 2nd intake opens up, and you can hear it, very nice. It sounded nicer than my Corvette ever did. The fit and finish are 1st class. The 8-speed Direct Shift automatic is a blast. The brakes are Brembo's, and are top- notch. Handling matches the Corvette. Road and Track states that it beats the Corvette in a number of areas. Awesome!!","When I start it up, it roars to life! The Direct Shift automatic is a blast to drive.",Selectable shock/spring rates would be nice for days where I don't need as much 'sport.'
5,great car!!!,EURIEBABY ,09/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I didn't expect to get 16 mpg on the street on this kind of sports car, but I am getting that. great handling, cornering and braking.

4.75,2008 Lexus IS F ,redline78 ,08/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Lexus built IS-F to compete with BMW M3. This car is supposed to go fast and have good handling at high speed.  If people want softer ride and slower car, that is what IS250 for. I say go fast or go home! :P My previous car was IS350 and I sold it to get IS-F. I love my IS350 and I love IS-F more. Faster car, very nice muscular/louder engine, 19"" gunmetal wheels made by BBS and brakes by Brembos... this car hits the mark in my book.  I was going to buy the new M3 but I bought this one instead.

No regret, this car is super fast at the same time super comfortable. I love this sport sound when you step on the accelerator. This car is totally different from my 08 LS 460. 2 years free maintenance, free car wash forever, free detail every year, reliability plus excellent customer service what more can I ask.

Now they have all the above plus speed and fun. The IS-F provides great acceleration, agility and high speed with great control and safety.    The top speed is over 185, but limited to 168 by a governor. The 0-60 time was 4.2 seconds but Lexus advertises 4.6 sec.

4.875,"Underrated by the ""experts"" and wrong",IS_F guy ,06/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"3 months ago I decided it was time to consider a luxury sport car.  My priorities are performance, technology and gadgets tied with reliability.  The IS F:  radical looks very much distinguishing itself as ""this ain't your Mom's Lexus"".  Much better ergonomics, beefier engine and of course Lexus reliability.  Done.","8 speed error reducing lightning fast, paddle shifting, launches.  Aggressive exterior styling.  Very audibly noticable robust 5.0 liter engine that screams once above 3600 RPM.",An adjustable suspension would be nice.  But that's not a major shortfall.

4.75,IS-Fantastic,NorthCoast ,05/30/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Overall this car has met or exceeded my expectations. I have been loyal to Lexus having 2 GS 430s in last 6 years but wanted more performance type numbers and feel. Magically, the IS-F was born. It is very unLexus in its stiffness and ride but what I was expecting in a true performance sedan.  It still has many of the nice Lexus features and luxury components. However, this is not your father's Lexus. I drove the M3 sedan after the Motor Trend article rating it better overall.  I think some of their points are valid but feel their overall conclusion wrong. The M3 felt a little more clumsy in tight turns and I didn't like the long throws of the manual transmission. I have no regrets.","Suspension, dual air intake, rapid fire paddle shifters when pushing the envelope.","Faux quad exhaust, dressed down interior compared to GS although glad they devoted efforts to gearing and ride."

It is 2nd to the BMW M3 on a full track.  It beats the Audi RS4 on both straight away and full track.  It has the best rating on gas consumption (as well as no gas guzzler tax).  More importantly, it is the most reliable and has the highest build quality out of all its competitors.  The 2008 Lexus IS-F is the overall best performer in its class.
