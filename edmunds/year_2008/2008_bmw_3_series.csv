2,When pretty is not enough.,Alan Patrignani ,04/20/2016,2,,2,,,1,,4,3,,,"There is no question that this car is a show stopper and loads of fun with the top down.  Based on the accolades and reviews, it is logical to assume that this car would be as great a performer as is looks.  That thought process became a myth when at only 28,000 miles, and having had all the recommended service on time,  my car began to stutter and would shake terribly on acceleration.  After 6 new coils (which took 2 service appointments) it ran smoothly for almost one day when it was discovered that it needed a new fuel injector.  Once we got past that, a week later it needed a new air conditioning evaporator coil.  Without the extended warranty the out of pocket expenses would have been outrageous.  And all of this at only 28,000 miles.  Amazingly enough, severl other owners that I have met casually have had similar experiences and cannot wait to sell their cars.  But we all hang on since the reviews are so compelling and create the 'BMW mystique' which somehow convinces us that it must be us...but perhaps not, perhaps it really an over-rated performance car.",,
2,Looks are deceiving,Eddy P. ,04/08/2016,3,4,4,,,1,3,4,3,,,"Mechanical issues all the time, 60k and so far have had to replace; The Alternator, Sparkplugs, coils, breaks, roaders, the battery. Also seems to be a big issue with the ABS module on this model. It goes bad and the Start light, Break light, and cruise control go off. To replace it is pretty expensive depending where you take it. So while the car is nice, make sure you only lease a BMW not what I expected when I got it. Not buying another one anytime soon.",,
5,"For a used car, a great value.",Al Powell ,02/26/2016,5,5,4,,,5,5,4,3,,,"I do a lot of my own minor maintenance, and that matters when you own a German car, especially a used one. My 2008 328xi Wagon came with 98K miles, but was in beautiful condition. I've driven it for a year and haven't had to touch it other than an oil change and to mount winter wheels, which I did myself. If you have a German car, stay away from the dealer except for specialized work and find a good independent shop that knows German cars. Basic maintenance like brake pads, rotors, filters and other normal stuff is pretty easy to DIY, so I'm not interested in paying labor rates for that. My 328xi Wagon and my wife's 09 328ix Coupe drive pretty much identically. I've never driven a wagon that handled so much like a coupe; it makes my eyes light up when I find a twisty road! The handling is excellent and great fun, but if you stay with the factory run-flat tires the ride will be a bit harsh. The seats are firm, but somehow they're still comfortable after 8 hours of driving. BMW has that exactly right, and the 3-series is fantastic on long trips! The instrumentation is too minimal (speedometer, tach, gas and but fuel mileage) but it's not a problem for those who trust lights and don't want lots of gauges. The driving experience is why you buy a BMW. The turbos have higher maintenance costs and more issues, so I bought the normally aspirated 328, which is a very reliable engine.  I am also one of the fortunate few who have the six-speed manual transmission, which makes driving at least 2x more fun. The shifter is quick and smooth, and the pedals are well set up for heel-and-toe shifting. BMW clutches tend to last a very long time, and my car has the original clutch at 105K miles. Clutch replacements will be expensive since BMW uses an unusual dual-disc flywheel that's expensive. Gas mileage is great for a sport sedan/wagon (mid to high 20's) for highway cruising, and in-town mileage depends on how heavy your right foot is (mine is heavy) and how much stop-and-go driving you encounter.The wagon model has enough room for four people (five only in a pinch) and a reasonable amount of cargo.  If you're packing for a sports event and bringing a fold-up canopy, you'll have to drop the smaller side of the 60/40 back seat to give yourself room for it. For groceries, trips with carry-on bags and a reasonable amount of cargo, you'll have no problems.",,

My 2008 335xi is a pleasure to drive, super fun, super comfortable, the perfect balance of power and luxury: The Ultimate Driving Machine (TM). Unfortunately, that comes at a severe cost in maintenance and repairs. Many of the parts used on these have very short life spans, and cost thousands to replace. My vehicle has less than 60,000 miles and currently needs a $1200 waterpump. The warranty for 2008's was a 4y/48k, so this one is out of pocket for me. I've had vehicles that go three times as long without needing a water pump, let alone such an expensive one. If you assume the waterpump will only last another 55,000 miles that's $2400 in waterpumps just to make it to 100k miles! *whistle noise*I'm 6 months away from having this paid off...

Recently my clock has been clearing the time.

Fun car to drive
","Needs to have a better charging system.
My battery died in 3 years and it is not covered under maintenance and warranty because this car is not driven once a day at least 10 highway miles in one trip.

Tires need to last longer than 12,000 miles.

The reliability in general needs considerable work.
I know that this car would be higher maintenance than my old Honda, however, I never expected the reliability to be so bad.

The GM 6-speed transmission is not as refined as the ZF, but still head and shoulders over any other auto that I have owned. DS mode and paddles provide plenty of flexibility and fun. AWD is sure-footed in rain and snow, and the xi is the perfect match for urban/suburban roads. 8K well-spent in options (ZPP, ZSP, Xenon, CA, iPod, Heated Seats, Metallic Paint).

The performance and handling are outstanding (unless you try to drive in 1/2"" of snow with the Sports Package). If you really want to have fun with it I highly recommend installing the Dinan Performance Engine Software upgrade. For $2k you can increase the power output to 384hp and the torque to 421lb-ft (and Dinan will match BMW's new car warranty).  It's no M but honestly it's plenty fast and nimble for quite a bit less cash.  It's sporty and fun when you want it to be yet still smooth and refined.",Love the interior design and the use of materials.  The Dakota leather smells sooo good you can taste it.  Sound system is excellent. The coupe's exterior has a much sleeker look than the sedan and it looks like it's ready to take off even parked in the drive.,The iDrive does not have a intuitive user interface which I understand has been improved for 2009.

I think of it as a jewelbox: small and compact, but very well constructed. It's the perfect personal luxury car for those who like to drive. There's nothing flashy about it, other than the badge, yet it still gets looks. Although some of the controls appear counterintuitive at first, most of the driving-related controls are well thought out, and make sense after you understand the reason behind their design. I'm very pleased with the quietness and comfort for the front seats, although if you are a large/tall person, you might need to look at a 5- series.

I am not sure why I bought a second BMW, since my 325 was below average in reliability. My 2008 has been a pleasant surprise.

Wanted a car that was roughly the same size and with 4-wheel drive.  The Coupe fit the bill since I don't need the room for the family at this point in my life.  I was hesitant about going to a 3-series from the 5ers but after 4K miles I am extremely happy with the car.  Not one issue has brought me back to the dealer.  Performance all around rocks. Stereo is great. I can even get 29+ MPG doing 70 MPH. Sport seats are a must.  Customization of features and access to features such as the iPod interface are very good through the iDrive interface.

I have still yet to find anything I dislike about the design and it has been 6 months! I absolutely love everything about it. One of those purchases that works out be more satisfying than anticipated long after. Not a cheap car, but a bargain for what you get. ","The iDrive is awesome.

The car does not corner well - there is significant body roll and the steering is not tight.  I am not sure if this is due to the runflat tires or maybe I should have gotten the M3, but then no AWD.  The engine is great, probably quicker off the line than my Audi, but not as strong once you're at speed and need to accelerate.  The gas mileage is also good.  The cup holders are a joke.

Garmin says ""In 500 ft make a rt on route 123 South"" - if you use the Australian lady enunciation.  Navtec says ""make the next right"".  Garmin shows road names on perspective view, Navtec doesn't.  iDrive requires too many actions for usage, and interupts other audio as it drones out it's directions.  Also, I plan to replace RFTs with GFTs when they wear out and lug a spare around in the trunk.

I was coming from a G35 and this car is definitely put together better and doesn't feel as cheap (because it isn't!!). Compared it to everything else in the same class and it is a bit more expensive, but so far, it was worth it. Run flats do make the ride a bit rough.

Realistically, I do not see how a daily commute needs 300+ hp.  The 328i provides adequate handling even w/o the sport(y) package when compared to the RX8 I traded in.  Unfortunately, the 16"" runflat all-seasons are a poor compromise.  Highway expansion joints are much more noticeable than the MB.  The MB has 17"" performance tires w/ lower profile.  BMW also worked diligently on cost-cutting when packaging the E90.  Where is the standard alarm? Where is the jack? How about a real cup holder?

All in all I am hugely impressed with the 328i and would in fact take the weight savings and naturally aspirated engine over the turbo motor (having only owned naturally aspirated BMWs in the past and having a very bad experience with a 1986 745i Turbo).","Handling, gearbox, standard stereo (10 speakers - I didn't even know I had that many), engine, gas mileage, styling, tires.","Tires - I say tires here as well as in favorite features because the standard Potenza RE050A's have great grip, but their runflat nature is simply too harsh for beat-up roads like in suburban NY where I live.

The car doesn't have the Sport Package, and IMHO doesn't need it.  In fact, I think it makes the ride more comfortable.

But the exhaust note from the twin turbos is what stole my heart. The steering is also very responsive but the suspension is just set to the compensate for people who want comfort, but also a little sportiness.

In third gear I'm already at 100 mph. This car is FAST! Also, the color options are great. I choose sparkling graphite w/ coral red leather. The interior and exterior designs are very pleasing to the eye. Great options are available like the iPod connection, comfort access, and rear park distance alert.

I'm an engineer by profession and have studied these cars extensively. My suggestion to anyone that is looking for a performance oriented car looking to purchase one, don't go by the bhp, rather look for torque and the rpm it is generated at. No regrets buying the BMW, its immaculate. No wonder it is the benchmark of its segment. Rear wheel drive gives a great sporty feel, avoid the all wheel drive. If you want AWD, buy the Audi. The quattro is far better than the xi models of BMW. BMW's got amazing gear ratios, an engine that responds at cruising rpm to accelerations and it sure turns heads!","Sports tuned suspension, high performance tires, high torque at low rpm, drop dead gorgeous looks esp with the fog lamps on at night.

I traded in an E46 M3 so there was a lot this car had to live up to. I couldn't believe that this car feels just as fast as my old M3 but is much easier to drive. The feel of the car is just as good but it handles the rough stuff way better. I need to mention something that has been a sore point for many reviewers but if you are at all computer literate, the iDrive will be a MUST have. There will be a learning curve but the technology integration is way better than many reviewers give it credit for. ","Performance, handling, comfort, interior design, iDrive, and of course the LOOKS","I wish that someone would make a M+S tire that fits this car.

To allow owning 2 cars (my second is a Boxster S) I kept the options on my BMW everyday driver at a minimum (leather/power seats).

Everyone says cupholders and iDrive. I can reach middle cupholder just fine.  iDrive does take some learning and could be more intuitive but once you have it down, $2100 cost is worth it.

This amazing car is worth every penny and is the nicest and best car I have ever owned, by far.  It is the perfect blend of style, comfort and performance.

Scary fast, with great pick up in any gear. The finish and technology are exceptional. I'm very pleased with the choice. Test drove Infiniti G37, but didn't make it out of the BMW dealer after test driving the 335xi (got it on the spot). Didn't go for the nav, bought a Garmin nuvi (noticed BMW also sells Garmins with the BMW branding).","The engine - oh my is it fast! x-drive just sticks to the road, bad weather is not concerning at all (no snow driving yet though). iPod integration, the robot arm that hands you your seatbelt, the on board monitoring  and built-in assist service, the sport seats, just about everything.","Gas mileage is probably as good as you could expect, but not great (around 18-19 in town). Power outlets could be better placed. RF tires a bit harsh riding."

None the less, the luxury of this car is unmatched by anything I have ever driven. ",The beautiful red leather seats. iDrive is much easier than people think. The concierge is a great feature.

5,The Ultimate Sports Sedan Bar None!!!,Mel ,04/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I wanted a sports coupe but needed 4 doors so I compromised and bought the 335i sedan.  With 300hp and tons of torque, it's the best of both worlds.  It is unbelievably fast, yet can handle the chores and hum-drum driving of daily life.  Going from 60-120 mph is effortless and so easy that I have to keep reminding myself I can't drive this way in the U.S. (Thankfully, I live in Germany at the moment).  Whenever I want to put a smile on my face, all I have to do is prod the pedal and hold on till the speed quickly reaches triple digits.  I drove the G35, Benz, Audi, and the Volvo.  They were nice cars but this one is great. I have no regrets.  The 335i is the ultimate sports sedan, bar none!","I originally was thinking of buying the 328i but when I drove the 335i, all logic flew out the window.  The 300hp, twin turbo engine makes this car what it is.  Thinking of passing a car?  No waiting, it happens right now! Instantaneous, smooth, powerful, and ridiculously scary in how fast it is.","I only have small suggestions for the 335i.  Storage is so measly, even the owner's manual doesn't fit properly in the glovebox.  The cup-holders are inadequate and if the interior is tan, why is the trunk still gray (even though you can't see it).  Small nit-picking improvements but nothing major."

5,German Bank Vault,My first BMW ,04/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was going to buy a G35 but thanks to limited headroom and no help from Infiniti to improve headroom, I picked the 328i. What a machine... ordered from the factory with Prem, Sport, Xenon, Comfort Access about a month ago and I've been smiling ever since. Razor like handling, & ample power.  The traction control works VERY well on wet or slushy WA roads --  no regrets for passing up the xi.  ","Handling, rock solid chasis ( like a German bank vault!), engine, headlights, traction control,comfort access (look Ma - no keys!),and the wonderful feel and smell of that leather!

The tight cornering, quick acceleration, and solid feel are the best selling points.  BMW USA and my local dealer have treated me like royalty!  The exterior styling is not over-the-top, but elegant and bordering on conservative.  The performance and power are exceptional.  The advanced technology is not overwhelming - it just works.  I am very happy.",The DSC and DTC plus other active control features are incredible.  The bluetooth integration and adjustable seating features are also favorites.  The driver can select which features to activate and can fine tune most settings.,"Accelerator lag in first gear is inconsistent during dead starts and takes away from the otherwise incredible driving experience.  The lack of enough power points for accessories like radar detectors, GPS, cell phones, etc. in the car is also a detraction."

It's the most reliable car I've had, has great space for the size and navigation system and Sirius radio rock! Navigation disses are silly. It's as easy to learn as an iPod which I love, and probably should be standard. Cupholders seem weird at first, but are okay. Comfort access is a great safety feature, and so is all-wheel drive. Gas mileage better than sticker. Drives like a BMW. Enough said. It's my first, but I've had Mercedes and such. Never anything but BMW from here on out. Get one. You will fall in love. I promise.","Handling, navigation system, iPod direct, comfort access, Sirius radio, memory seats, cargo space in wagon, panoramic moon roof, feeling secure in AWD.","Re-configure cupholders, especially one in center.

I was so very wrong, this car drives and rides so much better then anything I have ever owned. I had the chance to drive back to back the M35 2 weeks after I got my 335i (brand new rental) and wow, I loved the M35 until I owned the BMW. If you are considering any of those cars, you will not be disappointed in the 335i sedan. Impressed is an understatement.","The engine would have to be near the top of the list, smooth seamless power from 2000 all the way to red line. I have owned many cars and have never owned one that would just continue to pull no matter what gear you are in like this car.","The iPod or aux port for audio is very stupid place all the way back in the center console. Also, having a cup holder that far back in the center console is just a waste of space. The cupholders they do have are in the passengers space if you use them both at the same time."

I finally ordered a BMW 328i w/ 6MT, Sports, Premium, and Xenons... a pretty basic car in my mind as BMW tends to nickel and dime you for basics in a luxury sedan, i.e. leather seats, power seats, xenon headlamps.  Although BMW is relatively the most expensive, the handling is definitely the best for an entry-level luxury sedan.","Clutch easy to engage, shifter feels relatively short, and secure. Steering wheel with the sports package. Useable low-end torque.","The ""gong"" whenever you left the door open, need to wear your seatbelt etc., is kind of loud and obnoxious.

My last car was a 2005 330ci with the M sport package on it and I didn't think anything would rival the driving prowess of that car. Well, I was wrong! I strongly agree with one of the other reviews written earlier - this car is underrated!  If you want speed coupled with amazing handling then don't look any further.","The ENGINE! The ENGINE! Oh ya, one more thing - The ENGINE!","Only one real question mark and it's the run-flats. If you have rough roads in your area then I promise you'll feel every bump along the way.

After driving it I can say that this convertible  is one of the best handling cars I have ever driven.  Taking a winding road immediately puts a smile on your face as you take the corners and row through the gears. The top operation is amazing and when it is up not only does it not look like a convertible, but it also has a very quiet interior that is free of rattles and wind noise associated with convertible tops. The interior is very decadent with very rich leather over all surfaces.  This is a true 4 season car that is absolutely gorgeous top up or down. Great purchase!",Wonderous turbo engine!! Always has power and torque on demand even in 6th gear. Great tranny! Handles like a dream.  Rich interior.  Room for 4.  Hardtop makes owning a convertible in Oregon possible.  Sport seats that hug you tight.  Great heater and htd. seats for top down weather in the 50s.,"The top does severely eat up trunk space when it is down, and even when it is up there isn't tons to write home about.  It would be nice to operate the top at low speeds instead of having to be stopped.  Other than that, perfect car!"

Love the sound of the throaty engine just before the upshift.  You know that you're in a sportscar.  The paddle shifters are cool, but I don't suspect I'll use them much on my commute.  328i corned like it was on rails.  I took a couple of twisty bends on a backroad at about 60 mph with no sense of skid, roll or fishtail.  I had to be careful not to push too hard as the wheels lifted off the ground coming over one little roller.

The navigation system is a joke, the sales person told me that the reason it is not a touch screen is because it encourages drivers to pay to attention to the road. Try getting anywhere with a big button that controls everything and one mistake will force you to start over. I love BMWs for driving and I love the way they look but if you have recently moved and are looking for assitance in navigating through a city like Los Angeles this is not the car for you. In addition, the new cup holders block the passengers air vents and they are not convenient at all. The new placement of the window controls is not user friendly.","The automatic has great ""pick-up"" and the car hugs the road. It is a great car for major metropolitan areas as accelerating is never a problem and one can fit into most parking spaces but the inside is pleasantly roomy.","The navigation needs to be in touch screen format. The big button is useless and confusing and if you purchase the navigation that also controls your radio, phone and air conditioning/heat.

It's quicker, hugs every turn and the steering is tight and you always feel in control of your car. I have owned Audi and Mercedes in the past and this car outperforms them for 2008.","The tilting side mirror for backup, auto dimming mirrors, head light sprayers, bluetooth.",The net behind the seats looks junky.

I've always owned Infinitis, and was planning on buying the new G37, which looks just awesome.  In my eyes the G37 seemed like a better deal on paper, but after driving the BMW, you definitely realise why there is such a price disparity.  I can now understand why BMW owners are so loyal; I've never driven a car that feels like this!  The solidity, grip, material quality, attention to detail all far outshine anything I've owned before.  I love every aspect of this car, down to the seat belt stalks that bring your seat belt to you when you close the door & the beautiful ambient light surrounding the cabin at night. Brilliant.","Material quality is tops, unbelievable handling and driver feel, beautiful subtle exterior style, free maintenance, German attention to detail (e.g., able to run the vent/heater while car is parked), safety, European delivery, iDrive (not nearly as difficult as rumoured), BMW concierge.","Gas mileage, other than that nothing!"

I look for excuses to drive this car.  Handling is superb, engine smooth and alarmingly powerful.  I like the iDrive.  I really don't like the run flat idea (though they handle well).  Driver's cup holder is goofy.  Upgraded audio, iPod and Bluetooth excellent.  Nav screen doesn't switch to black background at night - dumb.  Gas mileage OK for this much power, but..  Too early for reliability, replaced brake bulb.","Suspension and handling; engine smoothness and torque; styling; seats;, adaptive headlights; sound system and iPod integration; Bluetooth; surprising rear seat room and comfort, though access is difficult for a six-footer, and likely impossible for someone older.

3.875,Too Bad the Seats Are Vinyl,Alex in MD ,03/13/2008,,,1,5,5,5,,5,1,4,5,"An otherwise fine car is marred by the standard vinyl ""leatherette"" seats that have no place on a luxury sports car.  While ""leatherette"" may look fine, no matter what you call it, vinyl is hot, sticky and uncomfortable.  Why don't they just offer and market honest cloth seats on the base model.  BMW was remarkably uncooperative in addressing the complaint.  While the seats could have easily been recovered in leather, BMW wanted a whopping $6,000 for the leather covers (when the leather package costs only $1,350 to order).  The car is nimble and great fun to drive, but the standard seats and total lack of customer support are troubling.","Sport package is fantastic.  Tight, nimble handling, but not at all a harsh ride.  6 speed manual is also crisp and fun to drive.","GET RID OF THE LEATHERETTE STANDARD TRIM.

It could be a bit more intuitive, but it is not useless. Real time traffic information isn't very helpful. Navigation works pretty good, but at some intersections, information didn't come soon enough.  RFTs make the steering heavier.  When I got a nail in one of them, it took several days to get a replacement.  Power top mechanism works very well.  With the top up, you get a decent cargo space, I think.  With the top down, you still have a space enough for a couple of airplane carry on size bags.  No mechanical problem so far at 2000 miles.","Good acceleration, power top mechanism. Good handling, good visibilty with the top up.  Maintenance program like no other.  Fit and finish.  Great colors. Quietness.  ",No RFT and a spare.  Switch for trunk release should stay on to make it easier to find.  Menu selection botton for iDrive should be on the dash side.  Comfort Access doesn't really add anything.

I am getting 21mpg in city driving and the car has not even been broken in yet. The torque curve is great and allows for acceleration in any gear without any engine stress.

It's quiet, handles like a slot car and accelerates like a V-8.  Mileage is almost the same as my 10 year old 3 series. The ride with the sport suspension is harsh over rough pavement.  Road noise is noticable over anything other than very smooth road. IDrive requires a learning curve. It's not intuitive, but once you get the hang of it, you have a lot of information and a lot more control over the functions of your car.  Although it handles well, it is a very heavy car for its size.  Brakes are a little touchy, but stop the car on a dime.  The windshield is raked back steeply.","Acceleration and fuel economy for the power.  Handling, quiet ride.  Great growl from dual exhausts when you step on it.

After driving SUVs for twenty years, I wanted something different but utilitarian. It's great... lots of room with fold-down seats. It handles so well, I hate to drive my husband's Mercedes E class as it's got so much more play and bigger turning radius.  It feels so loose compared to responsiveness of my wagon.  Got the AWD wagon for peace of mind. I was a Mercedes lover before this. Not anymore! ","Love the navigation system, integrated iPod, comfort access which makes opening and closing so easy.

I have about 600 miles on the car and just had a nail on of the tires. BMW dealer would not patch this and tires are not part of warranty. Costs about $300/tire to get a new one each time you have a bad luck running over a nail. In addition, they last only about 10,000 - 15,000 without mileage warranty from Bridgestone.","Nicer body style that he old one.

If you are considering this car be advised that you can only get RFTs (run flat tires). In addition the 18 five spoke wheels only come with summer performance RFTs. Note:  there isnt an all-season RFT available for the 18 wheel.   If you are not familiar with RFTs be prepared for the following. RFTs give a much harder ride, cost about twice as much as conventional tires and may not be able to be fixed if you have a flat. The result of that will be a replacement tire costing $300  $350!  I replaced the original RFTs on my 335xi Coupe with conventional high perf",The ride & handling.

The engine lives up to its reputation and then some.  Amazing low end torque - really does feel like a V8.  This makes the 335xi a very different animal from the traditional BMW inline-6 car, and while quicker, it feels somewhat less sporting.  With the old inline-6s (and presumably the new 328) you really had to spool up the engine.  Now, you don't have to push it and if you do you're soon over the speed limit.  Great fit and finish.  The xi drive is fantastic in poor conditions, although the xi suspension is softer than in my old E46 (more body roll).  All-in-all, very happy with it.","Engine: Amazing power and sounds great.  Xi drive: Makes the car a far more dependable commuter in poor weather.  iDrive: Maybe there are other systems that are easier to use, but the integrated nav, iPod controller, phone is fantastic.  Dynamic re-routing around traffic disruptions is great.","iDrive: Improve searching nav for nearby businesses (have to choose a category before searching now)  Xi suspension:  More body roll than I would like.  Car doesn't feel as sorted as an E46 in corners.  While it may be the AWD, a tighter suspension would help.  Run-flats: Get rid of them."

Nothing even comes close to the feel of the BMW. If driving enjoyment is your top priority, this is your only choice (save the 5 series, but you'll spend a lot more). All are excellent cars, but the 335i has something extra that you have to drive to experience. No probs for me with the run flat tires",Are you ready for this - I actually like iDrive.

There is more space in the back seat, my 5 year old's feet really don't touch the front seat like in the mercedes.

If you really want the driving experience, you have to get the 335 if you can afford it.  I was skeptical, but the reviews really are right, there's no comparison.  Other cars (CTS) are bigger, others are maybe better value propositions (G35x), but none match the driving experience. I had high hopes for the G35x since its close on paper, but its much less civilized in real life and I feel still a ways behind.

Combine this with the all-season capability of BMW's x-drive and you have a sport coupe that just may be the perfect car in this segment. The bottom line: if you want a race car buy one.
