It is my first luxury sports sedan and first car I am owning. I have to say I am very impressed with the overall quality of this car. It is 4 years old now (2008 model) but shows terrific condition and durability. The car has a stunning look and turns heads everywhere I go. The interior is Lexus quality at its finest.

5,Pleasantly surprised,Mike ,09/21/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Traded in a ES350 and although it was a wonderful car, it didn't feel like it was MY personal car.  The IS350 gives you that personal car feel and it is super fast and comfortable.  I have yet to see another one in the city which also makes you feel special.  Wonderful automobile with comfort and style.","great interior and exterior,comfortable seats in the front. Although the rear is a little cramped, I never have anyone in the back riding with me. Ultra quiet ride and FAST!  Great car overall.",Memory drivers seat would be nice.
4.75,Great sports sedan,Feh ,10/20/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Pros/Likes: Very silent, smooth V6 engine, powerful acceleration and pulls hard beyond 4000rpm, excellent brakes, bulletproof electrics, excellent base sound-system, vented heated seats great in summer, soft plastics are a pleasure to the touch, nice LED lighting ambiance inside. Absolutely nothing like a regular Toyota (even though people love to say Lexus are overpriced Toyota... NOT).  Cons/dislikes: Too silent for my tastes (needs a BMW like I6 grunt), awkward position of clock, tripmeter odo is not separate, navigation takes time to get used to, very limited headroom (I'm 5'9"" and my head brushes the headliner with the seat all the way flat).","Excellent acceleration/power for a V6, excellent brakes (much more powerful than the IS250 brakes).",Needs 1-2 more inches of headroom.
4.25,Great Car,Mike ,08/31/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"Bottom Line- Ultimate compromise between sport and luxury.  Very quick, smooth, glides over nicks and crannies in the road.  I spend plenty of time on the road- love the silent ride! On the contrary, when the pedal hits the mat, the engine makes an extremely defined roar. Comfortable as hell up front, not so in the back.  If I was at the track every day, 335i would be my choice.  If I needed a car that would accommodate my daily driving with comfort and performance- no brainer- IS350.  Excellent Audio.","Speed, comfort",Leg room
5,Very fine vehicle,Oregonhiker ,04/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just bought a 2008 loaded Lexus IS350 w/7,000 miles...this is my 5th Lexus, the others being SUV's, but have also owned 3 BMW's, including a wonderful M3. The IS350 is a great car. 98% of my driving is city, suburb or highway and it performs flawlessly. If I drove major ""twisties"" everyday, maybe I would have bought another BMW, but few of us have the ""true"" abilities to push either Lexus or BMW to their honest limits... It has 90% of the BMW capabilities, IMHO, plus a quieter ride, better interior, better exterior, more reliability and at least an equal resale value. It doesn't scream ""look at me""...hey, even the engine and muffler are quiet, but power is vastly available when you want it.","* Interior features / comforts (+ Nav) * Engine. Major power. * Resale value and reliability * Comfortable ride for hours * Exterior stance. * 18 inch wheels - graphite. * Overall Lexus quality... been loving THAT for years. * Not ""everyone"" has one. A little more exclusivity.","* Little bigger back seat. * Manual transmission option. Accept it for what it is...it's a Lexus, and a fine one at that. Stop comparing it to ""everything else"" and see how it stacks up to your criteria. It's a very fine vehicle that puts a smile on my face everyday. Best wishes in your search"
4.875,My IS-350,Stix1951 ,01/16/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love my IS-350. It is fun to drive, comfortable, great looking and handles nicely. The prompt response when needed or wanted is awesome when slipping into manual trans mode. Nav system is to be desired. It has some good points and I used it on several occasions to find my way but the voice recognition is worthless. Audio system is OK but it would be nice to see the track name and not just a number on CDs. Limited rear seat leg room could be a problem but I seldom use it so I deal with it. Memory front seats should be standard, after all, this is a Lexus.","Keyless entry, automatic to manual trans option is fun. Inside lighting is cool. Heat/cool ventilated seats are nice. Speed of car.","Total re-do of the nav system, especially the voice recognition. Make memory seats standard."
4.75,Lexus IS 350,D2ab ,08/30/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I absolutely love my IS 350. I looked at many cars in this class (BMW 335i, A4, Acura TL, Mercedes C class, etc.). I really didn't even want to look at the Lexus because everyone seems to be driving Lexuses these days and I wanted something different. However, once I saw the IS I changed my mind. We have had no problems and driving is very fun. The car is fast, but not as much road noise as other cars had. I had to get the luxury package to get the memory position seats and love having the heated and ventilated front seats. The interior is loaded and very comfortable.",Mark Levinson audio system is superb; love the keyless entry-this is so convenient; comfort of seats; speed of car. ,"Make the memory seats available as a standard feature; make the navigation system more user friendly,"
4.875,Wattarocket!,FuegoFan ,08/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I admit that I've only owned my IS350 for about six weeks now but I am very impressed with it so far.  My wife drives a 2004 Lexus RX330 so we were already familiar with the outstanding build quality of Lexus vehicles.  My last three cars had been Mercedes C-Classes.  Those were nice cars but Lexus has left Mercedes in the dust with the standard features, power, comfort and overall quality of the IS350.  What may be the most impressive is the value of the IS350 for the money spent but that has to compete with the hustle this car shows and the way it hunkers down when going into corners at speed.  It is a really fun car to own and drive!","Nav system electronics and capabilities are absolutely fabulous.  Power and torque off the line are very gratifying.  Leather interior is a great standard feature and ventilated seats make summer driving a pleasure.  And in black, this car even looks fast.","Fuel economy could use some improvement and there is as little rear seat legroom as in a C-Class or BMW 3-Series.  It would also be nice to hear some growl and grumble to the engine for all of the power with the pedal-to-the-metal, instead of the Lexus hum."
5,Performance + Luxury = IS350,igofast ,08/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Let me start by saying I test drove many cars before selecting the Lexus IS 350 (C350, 335i, G35, G37, CTS).  I believe it has the best combination of performance and luxury in this market segment.   The car is very fast, the interior is terrific, with very soft leather and a nice dash layout.  The seats are very comfortable.  I have the navigation and the Mark Levinson sound system options and the sound is fantastic!  The gas mileage is not that great but is costs a little extra to go fast!  Best car I have ever owned and the service at the dealership has been excellent.  So far I have about 6000 miles with zero problems.   Did I mention that this car is fast!!  And comfortable. ++","Sound system, performance, interior, bluetooth, lighting, reliability, F-Sport accessories.",Larger back seat area.  Fold down rear seats.  HD nav with music storage.
4.125,"Not bad, not great",Scott ,07/29/2008,,,3,5,4,4,,5,5,2,5,"So close to being perfect, a shame they blew a few details that make it less than so.  The luxury/sporty balance is second to none.  ML stereo sounds wonderful although XM sounds crappy (not Lexus's fault - it's XM's signal compression).  The nav is awful.  It suffers from obvious language/requirement translation issues in the design cycle - such a shame.  Stupid limitations and just not user friendly.  Nothing about it is intuitive.  Speech recognition is worst- in-class - inability to recognize simple commands render it unusable.  Bluetooth only auto-connects with one phone - how dumb is that.  Very limited steering wheel controls mean constantly trying to navigate menus.","Leather, power, cornering ability.  I like the fact that it doesn't sound like a throaty sports car inside - I don't need that.  If the infiniti G35 rode smoother and wasn't so loud, I would have gone with it.  For folks who want a real balance of power and luxury, this is it.","Improve nav and extend controls to the steering wheel.  For example, if I'm surfing XM presets (only 6 at a time *sigh*) I should at least be able to see the current song - but no. It sucks. Car is unnecessarily heavy which hampers milage. It's only 300 lbs lighter than my old V8 LS - go figure. "
3.375,Navigation System,wrecks ,06/18/2008,,,3,4,3,3,,4,3,4,3,"The navigation system on this car it totally useless. No input while driving, no turn by turn guidance in unverified areas (smaller towns). While driving on a route if you enter a smaller town the guidance stops and  you are on your own until you come to major highways. I purchased a Garmin nuvi 760 for my navigation needs, works better and guides for all occasions. I should have kept my Acura TL. Much better car.",,Open the GPS to the technology.
4.75,A nice blend of luxury and comfort,Matt ,04/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"The IS 350 is a very good alternative to the BMW 3-series.  I was planning to get a 335i coupe, but gave the IS 350 a look and I liked the IS better than the bimmer.  Dont get me wrong, the BMW handled real nice (free maintenance for 4 years is tough to beat), but I do most of my driving on the highway, so I needed that a car that has both comfort and performance.  The IS also looks better than the BMW, and it was less noisy (dealership told me it was due to run flat tires).","The car is powerful, and very comfortable even with the sport suspension.  Passenger-side standard 10-way power seats are a nice touch since its a option with the 3-series.","Fuel economy could be better.  Even though you can manually turn the traction control off, it still comes back on after 15-20 mph."
3.5,This car has too many rattles,astrajet1125 ,04/13/2008,,,1,5,3,5,,3,3,4,4,"I'm shocked at the amount of rattles this car has in the first few thousands miles. As of today 7 squeaks and rattles!! I've been to the dealer 7 times with poor results. I was informed that they were ""noise"" issues not rattles and to deal with them as the nature of the car.  Not the Lexus service they advertise! Do not buy this car if squeaks and rattles bother you.","Lighting, GPS, XM, ambient interior lighting, smart key features, design lines",
4.625,Still more luxury than sports sedan.,James B ,04/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"The Lexus IS 350 is still more luxury than sports sedan.  Straight-line performance is fantastic, and the automatic transmission is smooth. I am a tall/large guy and this car fits me well, due largely to a very adjustable driver's seat. The intake and exhaust notes could be more pronounced like on the BMW 3. The brakes and tires are high-performance versions (something tells me to compete better in comparos with the 3-series) and will wear out quickly, so be prepared to replace them often or get the less performance- oriented / higher-mileage substitutes. The body styling is wonderful, this car is truly curvy and beautiful.",The 3.5L engine is wonderfully powerful and eager to run.  The ventilated seats are great for hot summers.  Sunroof controls are easy to use.  ,"The navigational system's touch screen functionality is severely crippled while moving, due to ""liability concerns"" by Lexus corporate. If you are a tech/navi geek you may prefer the other vehicle brands that don't treat you like a child while the car is moving. Also the back seats are very small."
4.875,Fast sporty sedan,Eddy ,02/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I came from driving a highly modified Toyota MR2 turbo.  I miss the stick, but the smooth powerful acceleration more than makes up for it.  The car is quiet, sometimes too quiet and the ride is firm, but smooth.  I have around 2000 miles on so far and enjoy every mile of driving this car.  I feel so grown up driving this car too!",Push start button. nice sound system. Very nice exterior and interior design.  ,Availabilty of a manual transmission. 
3.25,Should have gone with the 335i,MPS ISO ,02/21/2008,,,4,3,4,4,,3,3,2,3,"I test drove the 335i, G35, G37, Acura TL, and A4. The BMW was easily the best driving car in every aspect, more refined, fluid, and precise by far. I went with the IS because of the reliability for my wife, plus she liked the interior. So far the IS has been in the shop four times for squeaks & rattles. The car handles like a Buick compared to the BMW. The suspension is harsh and the car has needless understeer, always pushing and sliding the front end beyond the intended arc. There really is no feel in the controls (steering, throttle, and brakes). If your near retirment age and want a melow driving exp this car is great. Fit and finish are great and the car does have a strong engine.","Interior materials, Sound system, nav. Great for straight away power. ","Body style - looks like a Scion. Fix the rattles. Larger back seats, better gas mileage. "
4.875,Best car in class,Jeff ,02/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The IS 350 is a great car. Beautiful inside and out. Very fast! You will never want for power. I traded in a 350Z anniversary and this car is faster! Great sound system. Love the seats. Looked at all the cars in this class and this car is better in every way. Test this car last because you will love it, and buy it! Black with tan is hot. It turns heads eveywhere I go.","Quiet ride, push button start. great looks and power power power!",Better location of power outlet and bluetooth should be standard. 
3.75,Best looking and performing IS yet!,Shaun ,01/10/2008,,,3,4,3,5,,4,4,3,4,"Pros - power, handling, ride comfort, overall appearance, decent gas mileage considering its 306 HP output, quiet and smooth.  Cons  - poor instrument panel on the center console. HORRIBLE FUZZY LED panel (not a defect, all ISs are like that), Gas mileage could be better, lack of remote start (even by a third party).",How smooth the acceleration is and how quiet the cabin gets when cruising. ,"For god's sake, change the center LED panel!

4.5,IS 350,moznick ,01/04/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"Have only put 500 miles on our new black with cashmere interior.  Initial observataions:  build quality excellent, power dramatic.  Interior very comfortable for two in the front seats; I think the back seats are for children only.  The placement of the driver's power window buttons is odd and uncomfortable to access, otherwise interior layout is good.  Despite the large engine, I have so far averaged 26 mpg for mostly highway driving.  That is outstanding!  Test drove one with the sport suspension; the wife thought it was much too harsh - there really is quite a difference so you should try both.","Favorite feature has to be that power. Also good handling and great gas milage.  Very comfortable front seats.  Also like the keyless entry, car start.",Better placement of the driver's power window buttons or reposition the handle.  Would not recommend for someone who will routinely carry three or four normally sized people.

Thought just a little about buying the ES, but not a chance when I seen the IS, ES looks now too much for the older Buick type of a crowd. The car is just fun, love to drive it, and can't wait to drive it everyday!","The beautiful leather, the dash, the sound system, and wow, just the whole look of it - everything!!!","The back seat, oh well I am always in the front, and didn't buy it to drive other people around in it."

While people complain about the car being too tame, it's no more than an excuse because all the vehicle control systems can be disabled easily with the press of a button.

The Lexus looks too much like a compact car. At the same time it still come with a lot of luxury.  The cost of the Lexus is pretty high too. I plan to keep this car for around 5 years. We'll have to see how much it cost to keep it up.,Great ride and power. First class but too small truck. The engine compartment is first class too. This car has rear wheel drive.
