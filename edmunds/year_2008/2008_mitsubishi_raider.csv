2.125,Most disappointing Mitsubishi,fraggledrock ,06/25/2012,,,3,3,1,1,,2,4,1,2,"I was a devoted Mitsubishi owner because my Mighty Max served me so well for 15 years & over 200K miles until it was totaled. I bought a 2008 Raider expecting the same durability & have never been so wrong! At 62K miles the Raider has major mechanical issues - bearing failure in the rear differential. To make matters worse the component isn't repairable & requires complete component replacement. Unlike most 2008 models from Mitsubishi, these units do not have a 10 year 100,000 mile power train warranty a clear statement of no confidence by the manufacturer.","Although I appreciate the comfort including a much improved heating system, significantly more interior space and a more car like ride, I'd trade it all for the reliability I'd come to expect from Mitsubishi.",Mitsubishi needs to acknowledge their responsibilities and assist consumers by providing help with repairs on these clearly substandard vehicles!
4.25,Nice pickup truck,raul ,09/30/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,3,4,"The ride is very smooth and quiet.  For the price I paid I am very happy, I really like this little truck. ",Exterior design.  Road handling is great. The warranty and road hazard warranty is excellent for this vehicle. ,"Fuel consumption, improve the start off power."
4.125,Bought new,Art ,09/29/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Looks great-mileage is still improving, have only 3000 mi on it. Am getting 18 to 20 in town-no hwy. drive yet-handles great-ride is wonderful (car like). Roomy compared to my 02 Ranger XLT-if it proves as reliable as Ranger-will be terrific. Price was right. V-6 Plenty of power for me. Cruising along at 50mph results in no more than 14 to 1500rpm.",,
3.625,It's a Truck??,Kusch ,08/01/2009,,,4,5,2,3,,3,4,4,4,"The only thing that makes this a truck is a bed and a bumper hitch!! Granted, at the time of purchase, I was looking for an SUV, after years of driving a Full Size F150. So, I settled for 50/50. I loved it, until I bought a boat. After a few months of towing on the weekends.......things started going wrong. I figured I'd save up the problems and turn it in for service and warranty at the one year mark. It's at the dealership now...and I'm waiting...and waiting...  The service and warranty are great, they just had alot of stuff to fix. Bottom line, if you want a truck, buy a truck. If you want a nice looking 4 dr, but this truck. Do not treat it like your last pick-up, as it won't last long.","Interior and Exterior design, wheel and rim size. It is roomy for a midsize. Warranty and Service of Mitsubishi","Tranny for towing...get away from the cheap plastic parts...HD rear bumper. The hitch holds great, but the bumper bends!"
4.25,Good option at a good price,Dave ,06/22/2009,,,5,4,4,5,,4,5,3,4,"Although my Raider (rebadged Dakota) may not compete with some of the more refined trucks in its class, the Raider is an excellent choice for the price. The V6 provides decent power, the interior is roomy, and the features are simple to use. For the price and what I get in return, this vehicle is a good option.","Roomy interior. Decent power, 3.7 V6 is a proven engine from Dodge. Interior features are easy to use. Comfortable seats. Attractive styling.","Highway ride a little unrefined. Poor gas mileage, but competitive in class. Cheap plastics. No V8 option for the Mitsubishi version."
4.75,3 years and Still Awesome,Tim ,03/16/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased my raider in 2006 brand new and after a while I took it upon myself to improve the fuel economy by installing a cold air intake kit that brought me up to getting as much as 24 mpg on the highway and about 19 in the city. The ride is great and comfortable, she's fun to drive and I am going to upgrade it with more parts to help make her more fuel efficient and fun to drive by switching to a performance exhaust and higher performance spark plugs and cables which will be an inexpensive yet effective upgrade. I look forward to many more years of driving my Raider.","Its exterior design in particular is beautiful and striking,  it does not look like any other truck out there and I like that. She's long and very nimble in traffic.","Definitely improve the fuel mileage. Improve the start off power, and add a stronger engine."
4.625,I Love  My Raider,Aquawanticee ,12/03/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,I have only had my truck for 1 day. I fell in love right away. My Raider  will be a farm truck and my personal ride to and from work every day. It has all the  power a sensible driver needs. I feel certain it will pull a two-horse trailer with no problem.,"It is a very handsome truck. It turns heads. I feel very safe in my Raider. I love the size and well, everything about it. I hope to drive him for many years.",A tilt steering wheel and maybe a few more bells and whistles in the cab. I am genuinely happy with my new ride.
4,First truck,1truck ,05/19/2008,,,3,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,This is my first truck and I like it.  So as for the mileage still trying to get a handle on it but it seems to be around 17 or 18 in town.  I thought the 40/20/40 bench seat would be awful but it surprised me and makes you believe that you have bucket seats.  Like the storage in the armrest.  So far I am happy with it and it looks good.,"The exterior, interior and wheels.  ","Radio controls in steering wheel and even though I like the front seat arrangement, if I were any bigger it could be a tight fit. Back seat storage could be deeper and getting the jack out could be simpler."
2.875,Not What I Expected,DWilder ,05/11/2008,,,3,4,3,3,,2,3,2,3,"Have had the truck just over a month and fuel mileage is not what I expected. Have been told it will get more after some break in, but don't really believe that. Thought I'd get at least 24 on the highway but struggles to get 20. Take off power from dead stand still really slow. Transmission a little clunky. Traded in a 98 Ford F150 and got a pretty good deal but not much improvement on gas mileage. Truck does have nice body and does ride better on rougher roads. Interior features are OK. Like the white background speedometer panel. Has pretty nice interior room. Wished I had looked around some more since fuel prices are so high now and looked at something with better fuel mileage.",Looks and style are great. Road handling is good. The warranty and road hazard warranty is excellent for this vehicle. ,Improve the fuel mileage tremendously. Work on the clunky transmission. Improve the start off power from stand still.
4.75,Strong truck,smith ,05/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Purchases this truck less then a month ago.  1st fill up got 19 mpg, mostly highway with ac on.  Acceleration is what I expected with a 6cyl, and the ride is very smooth, almost car like.  Owned a Colorado previously, and this truck surpasses the Chevy in every category.  Manual seat is still comfortable, and had no problem finding a good driving position.  Get many looks and compliments, plus the $5500 rebate off of the invoice didn't hurt.  Definitely do not regret this purchase..","Exterior looks, wheels, interior set up, storage ",Slightly better pickup and mpg..but then again it is a truck!
3.75,ok truck,joe ,05/06/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,1,5,2,3,"For most part, I like the truck, def. No power at all. Love setup, love the comfort and looks and love the height, I have a ram 4x4 with 3"" lift and the raider is only an inch or so shorter on height then my 3"" lifted ram, so love that. Comes with some good tires Goodyear wranglers. Rims are nice on it as well.","looks, comfort","Def. needs a bigger or at least more power engine then the 3.7l v6 that's in it now. especially in the double cab, like i have."
2.5,Just don't cut the mustard,David ,04/15/2008,,,2,4,3,3,,1,3,1,3,"Had the truck for 3 weeks, 16 mpg no matter how you drive around town..18 on the highway.Truck seems to be solid built but extremely underpowered with the 3.7 v6. Small inside cab as an old day small import is but the outside will fool you as it appears to be a full size truck. Might as well buy a full sized Silverado or F150 concerning the gas mileage and engine size for weight ratio. Had it to do over, would not buy one with the v6 would opt for the v8- then price wise- a Silverado or Ford with a v8 would be cheaper and more comfortable inside. Feels like a 4cyl powered truck. Nice design power train leaves room for beter power to weight ration and definitely pick up-a VW bug will do it in!",Looks and style,Get rid of the Mickey mouse motor (3.7) and at least put a match box toy engine in it.The 3.8 Endeavor v6 puts this truck power to shame.
