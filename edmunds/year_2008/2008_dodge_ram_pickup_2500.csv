And I can say that build quality for this has been lackluster to say the least. The fuel mileage on the 6.7 diesel is terrible and the only way to improve it is with the DPF delete kit. At 35000 miles had to replace all the ball joints, maintenance cannot be done on it without getting filthy on even the simplest of items. I use mine as a horse to pull heavy loads most of the time but the fuel mileage is so bad that most of the time I try to use another vehicle At best I get 13-14 mpg with it empty driving very conservatively And I have the DPF delete kit on it. It's a poor quality build all around. Cannot recommend.",Lots of low end torque when loaded down. Cab is reasonably comfortable but need to lower tire pressure to smooth out the ride. Cruise works well. Seems quite in the cab when going down the road but this is my 6th diesel P/U. Really like the stereo controls on the steering wheel. Good stereo. ,"Fix MPG this is horrible. Without modifications to the truck I would only be getting 10 mpg on the highway. Even with mods to the truck still only getting 13-14 mpg. The windshield post are way to big, it creates a huge blind spot. Have almost been in 3 accidents because of this. Auto transmission in tow mode needs serious improvements will downshift and over rev when going down hills even with jake brake on. I've had to throw it up in neutral several times to prevent this. The front end needs serious re-engineering replacing all the ball joints at 35k miles  on a 3/4 ton truck is bad engineering.   Chrysler corp needs to wake up consumers will respond if you make a good quality product. "

The Dodge had the best ride of the 3 and although I preferred the interior of my 1500, I still felt the Dodge was most modern (GM's still looked like it hadn't progressed since the 80's). The dodge also had the quietest diesel (especially cruising at highway speed) and the cleanest with essentialy zero soot exhaust. In the end, my satisfaction with 5 years driving my 1500 sold me on the Dodge and reputation sold me on the cummins engine. The truck can be used as a daily driver, work truck and capable off-roader.  ","Interior room (quad cab). Great ride. Minimal road noise in Cab with closed windows. Better mpg (city and hwy) compared to my 2002 4.7l Ram1500. Feels like it has unlimited power on or off the road, never seeming to strain. Satelite radio is great for long trips in mid MO.

Yeah, It's been to the dealer for a check engine light twice, the turbo's been cleaned out. Here's what I learned: Do NOT use fuel additive regularly even if it is ULSD / DPF safe(maybe for very cold weather), do not make many short trips without long ones in between, take a long drive at a respectable speed (at least 50mph for 50 miles will clean out the dirty end of things), avoid stop & go traffic, and don't stomp on it all the time. ","Despite the above, since the computer was flashed and the turbo cleaned, I figured out how to drive it and have yet to have a problem. It's still stock. This engine has power from start to finish. I get 24 MPG at 50 mph and about 16 at 80. I like the hard shifting 6 speed auto and the exhaust brake.",Dear Dodge: please recirculate exhaust gas after it's been filtered or better yet ditch all of that and use a urea SCR system.

Four Wheel drive in the sand at Cape Hatteras was no problem at all.  I found that the slightly stiffer ride on the road really paid off when the wheels left the pavement.  It handled the bumps off road with ease and gave excellent off road performance.  btw - The stiffer ride goes away with a trailer or payload too. ,"Diesel Engine, Exhaust Brake, Horsepower, Torque, MegaCab Comfort, Power Sunroof, Power sliding rear window, limited slip differential, four wheel drive, trailer mirrors.",Offer a color matched Kevlar reinforced spray-in bedliner as an option right from the factory.  I did this after market via a Line-X dealer.
3.75,6.7L Cummins Disaster,mc1374 ,08/05/2008,,,5,5,5,1,,3,5,1,5,"With 8 check engine lights and a diesel exhaust odor that comes from the vents with the AC/Heater on when the truck comes top a stop. A total of nine trips to the dealer for repairs. I would not advise any one to purchase a Dodge Ram with the new 6.7 Liter Cummins Engine. I now have to hire a lawyer(Lemon Law) to have this truck bought back because Chrysler will not work with me on a vehicle swap. Other than that its a good truck, fun to drive and built solid. But how Chrysler has treated me after owning 4 other Dodge trucks. I will be going to buy a GM truck after this one is bought back.",Looks of the truck. Laramie model. Exhaust Break,Better customer service from Chrysler. Get rid of all the emissions junk on the diesel engine. Better fuel economy in city driving.
4.875,Best Overall Value,benjaminak ,07/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My wife and I just got back from a 10 year anniversary trip to Kauai, Hawaii and were put into a 2008 Toyota Corolla rental car. First we were surprised by the fuel efficiency but when we returned home to our 2008 Dodge Ram hemi we realized that there was no comparison in the overall value. The comfort and utility was such a contrast to what we had rented that we both were very grateful we had made the right decision for our active family of four. Everywhere we drive we get nods of approval and our truck has gotten us safely through rugged Lake Tahoe winters and roads that the little Corolla couldnt dream of. ","Interior space, well designed handles and cup holders, 4 wheel drive is smooth, hemi power when needed, 20 inch tires, fun to drive.",Even darker tint on windows; my wife is always getting checked out when we drive.
3.375,Looking for my brothers,UNHAPPY LOYALISTS ,07/10/2008,,,4,4,4,1,,4,5,2,3,"This too is my 6th Dodge truck and second turbo diesel in last 15 years. I trade a perfectly good 2005 2500 Diesel 4WD truck for this one for one reason, THE SPACE IN THE BACK SEAT. And I haven't been disappointed in that area, megacab is awesome. But this is the only good thing about this truck. I have had nothing but problems with the ""check engine"" sensor going off constantly. I have put 18,000 miles on this truck in 6 months and in that time I have had it in service at least 12 times for the same thing. An O2 sensor had to be replaced before I ever took it off lot. I have also had numerous service calls on the tire inflation sensor. Could be great truck. Anyone else having this?",Without a doubt Mega Cab,"Fuel economy not as good as 2005 model, emissions sensors scrapped totally and the tire inflation sensors."
3.75,Emissions causing trouble (turbo),2500 6.7 Diesel ,06/13/2008,,,5,3,3,4,,4,3,3,5,"The truck would be great if the new emissions regulations would not be causing so much trouble. Second time in 4 months the turbo needs replacing and seems every other month having to have it cleaned. When pulling a load shifts very hard. Also, since having trouble with the emissions, was told by dealership had to run with exhaust brake so now have to turn that on every time start the truck, should be automatic.","Love that the diesel is very quiet. I have been getting pretty good diesel mileage so far, only have 14,000 miles.",Body dents pretty easy.
4.25,Dodge 4x4 Diesel 6.7 engine,john  ,03/25/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,1,5,"This is my 5th Dodge truck, and 2nd diesel.  The driveablity of this truck is fantastic, power is awesome, comfort is great for a HD truck.  Haven't towed too much with it yet, but it does well there with plenty of power.  The Major Letdown of this truck is the fuel economy.  I get 10 around town and 13 on the highway at 75 MPH.  And this is with the 3.73 gears.  Other 6.7 owners I know have had the same experience.  ","Lots of power, very roomy and comfortable.  A pleasure to drive.  ","Cloth seats are comfortable, but I really miss the crushed velor seat coverings.  The coverings used now are not soft."
5,2008 Dodge 2500 w/6.7 Cummins,scott ,03/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the 2008 Dodge 2500 with the 6.7 Cummins Diesel.  After test driving the Chevy and Ford the decision on what type of truck to buy was easy.  Dodge all the way!  I tow a 27' boat that weighs 9500 lbs and it tows with ease. The mega cab is a must.  What a difference, especially if you have passengers.  The gas mileage is decent and keeps improving.  I would suggest this vehicle to anyone who wants to buy a truck,","Navigation system, mega cab roominess, sunroof, simple/functional dash functions, the engine is quiet and powerful.","Include a transmission temp gauge on the dash, back up camera as a Laramie feature."
4.125,2008 RAM 2500 Quad-Cab 4X4 SLT Diesel,Roy ,03/14/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,2,4,"Only 2500 miles on this truck so far, so things may change.  Very quiet for a diesel, very powerful and turbo spools very quickly.  Ride quality poor relative to competitors, still is pretty quiet.  6-Speed manual is not very smooth shifting, and takes a while to get used to. Interior design pretty good in my eyes, not a lot of wasted space and the rear fold-flat floor a great idea.  So far fuel mileage is not great (14 mpg) but I've been pulling a light (4,000 lbs) trailer for half of the mileage. The Cummins engine is what sold me on this truck and I hope it proves to be a good decision.  he Ford may be a worthy competitor though.","Cummins engine-the 24 valve 5.9 was great for reliablity and power but noisy. This one is more powerful and hopefully as reliable, plus it has an exhaust brake (I don't know why, but its cool).","Improve ride quality, turn radius, and fuel economy. Make the transfer case selector knob seem less like part of the climate control. Make G56 (manual transmission) shift more smoothly."
4.75,2008 Megacab 6.7L,cjh ,02/21/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I recently took delivery of my truck and am very pleased with the vehicle. I have took the truck on 2 snowmobiling trips towing a 2400lb trailer.I was towing in a horrible storm and the truck drove perfectly. I replaced my 2005 Nissan Titan with this vehicle and this truck is so much superior to what I had. Towing, power, comfort, reliability. The  diesel engine is even quieter than the titan gas motor. The ride is suprisingly good for a 3/4 ton,due to the long wheelbase. The transmission shifts smoothly. So far it has been reliable with no factory defects. Time will tell. Much happier with this truck and think buy American is where it's at in Truckland.  ","Motor, transmission, Jake brake, stereo, build quality, styling","Include bedrail caps,and tailgate caps and some sort of bedliner. Better drink holders throughout cabin. "
4.875,"Strength, Build Quality & Easy to Drive",Jblove ,01/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I just took delivery on a 2008 SLT 4X4 2500 with auto and 6.7L Diesel.  What a truck!  This vehicle handles like a 1/2 ton but the ride is a bit tighter.  I went from a 2002 Toyota Tundra TRD 2WD access cab. I like the quad cab door arrangement as I always felt that the suicide style doors of the rear Tundra were worthless in parking lot when your right next to another car.  This Dodge actually turns better (turning radius) than the Tundra but parking is still a slight challenge.  The long bed or Mega cab with the longer wheel base would be much worse.  The engine has power to spare and mileage on freeway at 65 is 21 - 22mpg with 100 miles on car...around town is not so good...12 - 15 mpg.,"The diesel motor, UConnect -- works better than the Bluetooth in my 2007 Land Rover, ride and handling is excellent, solid build so far, transmission is also excellent.  The exhaust brake is a very nice feature and will save brakes on grades when towing a trailer or under load.  Electronic 4WD","Wheels are a bit small looking and the truck does ride a bit high so it is tough for some to get in.  I think I will add side steps.  Should come standards with protection for the top edges of the bed, too soon to tell about other things at this time.  So far, so good."

I have to say that durability is very important to me. This truck has a ton of power, and has been reliable, even starting at -6 with no problem at all. The transmission shifts gears smoothly, never searching for the right gear as some others do. I would recommend this truck to anyone who is looking for a reliable truck that rides really smooth for a heavy duty ¾ truck.",6.7-Liter Cummins turbo diesel engine equipped with the six speed automatic transmission.

4.375,Love my truck,jcrow ,01/03/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"I am very happy with my new truck. Owned the 2000 1500 4X4 and put 135,000 on it with only a water pump break down but it was not enough truck to haul 2 horses. This truck sure is, I didn't realize what a difference the bigger truck would be. I have the gas engine and it is currently getting 18 mpg on the freeway same as the 1500. Towing I get about 13 mpg. Lots of get up and go with the trailer when I need it. Still getting used to the new interior design, trying to figure where to put things like sunglasses,storage under back seats is better than previous design. Ford friends say my mpg will decrease dramatically at about 60000 hope they are wrong and just looking for something to pick at.",Better under back seat storage,Floor heat is poor for those of us with cold feet
4.875,6.7l,ROB ,12/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Love this truck.  Replaced a 2004 hemi 1500 and love this truck.  Only bought because loved teh 1500 so much.  Love the CTD and so smooth.  getting around 15mpg city and bit more like 17-18mpg hwy and should increase like any broken in CTD..  Love the leather heated seats and sunroof.  Paid a lot less then any Ford or Chevy and the power blows them away.,,

I hate to say it, but my '06 Hummer H2 does better than this!  I did have a '99 Dodge 5.9 Cummins which averaged 18 mpg on each tank, long trips 21 - 24 mpg were normal.  Besides economy, this thing has immense power, I have 35 inch tires on it and the torque abounds.  I hope this tranny can handle the power better than the '99s. I will definitely upgrade to leather seats, the copilot complains there is no heat and limited adjustments on the right side.  All the storage compartments are great & make good use of unused voids. Style beats Chevy & Ford. No problems with vibrations.","Must mention: I only have 1500 miles on it so far, so still a new truck. Exterior style, red is hot!  6.7 liter Cummins is potent and quiet(unlike my old '99).  Much better use of space in cab.  Dash is tidy, like the hidden cup holder tray.","What were the engineers thinking with the fuel prices of today? I am agressively searching aftermarket vendors for economy boosting add-ons. Why not offer leather in SLT?  Or put a class 4 hitch under the bumper, standard?  Need more handles to help you into the 4x4. Wimpy front bumper."
