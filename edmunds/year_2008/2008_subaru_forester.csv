5,"175,000 miles few problems",Bob in Silver Spring Md ,08/16/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"Purchased used in September 2009..  Hard to believe it's at 175,000 miles and still runs smooth and responsive. Replaced rear brake pads one time. Most expensive repair.  Right rear wheel bearing which is a common problem on Subaru. $450.00 repair. Most expensive maintenance item.  Timing belt with water pump and pulleys. I paid $600.00.  The dealer charges $1200 or more. Tires are an issue.  Buy good ones and they will last.  Yokohama seem to last longest.  The seats are not good for long trips. Get a small memory foam pillow and that will take care of that. Weird stalling and idle problems started at 142,000 miles and traced to small valve on intake manifold. Remove electric hook up, remove two Phillips screws, spray valve with intake manifold cleaner and problem solved. Remove spark plug wires and inspect for oil. Valve cover gasket leaks common problem on these cars but I haven't had to replace them yet. Overall it's a good safe solid car. Nothing fancy but reliable when you work through the issues. Make sure when replacing plug wires to use spark plug grease on both ends of wires. Another issue. Headlights started leaking at 160,000 miles.  Don't even try to fix them. Order new ones off Ebay for $300.  You have to remove the entire front end to replace them.  It's time consuming not difficult. It's 8 years old at this point and has held up well.",,

I would definitely buy another vehicle from them. Car has things to fix, but nothing major. CD player doesn't work and back panel of lift gate rattles. But otherwise in good shape. Only had for a month so far",,
5,Best car I've ever owned,danieluga ,06/20/2015,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Really hate to be the obnoxious reviewer who gives all five stars, but this car has earned it. It's more comfortable than Cadillacs I've owned and has great fuel economy for an AWD (though I wish Subaru would introduce a fleet of hybrids). I usually get 30mpg hwy, but I don't really drive city. 113,000 miles so far and no issues whatsoever. Definitely will buy another one in the future.","all wheel drive, fuel economy, heated seats, quality interior surfaces","more legroom in rear, digital speedometer like Prius or Honda would be easier to use"
5,Fantastic Car!  Buy it if you can!,luvmycar7 ,12/15/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a fabulous car!I have owned my 2008 Subaru Forester for about 2 and a half years now.It has been without a single problem the entire time.One of the things I love most about my Subaru is its versatility.It gets good gas mileage, but I have also used it for hauling huge items of furniture, kayaks, pontoon rafts, 5 people, all the luggage of a long trip for me and my entire family, and building supplies for my house.It is such as safe car as well.My wife was rear ended while in our in our 1998 Subaru Forester by a Ford F250 going fast when she was at a stop.The car completely absorbed the impact and saved her life.After that, we had to get another Subaru Forester.","Storage Ability, fuel efficient, and safe.","It is fabulous.

3,Quality problems,asdf ,08/20/2010,,,3,3,1,1,,4,4,4,4,"I have now had the XT 'newer' version for a little over two years.  At 9k miles the engine seized up!  I had poor customer service until I called Subaru's US headquarters and tried to talk to president to complain about the quality of their cars.  In the end; Subaru fixed the car.  I have had LED puddle lights short out each winter (one time I actually witnessed smoke!) Now, I need to take back to dealer again with separate electrical problems.  I would be satisfied with this car if I didn't have to take to dealer so much.  The XT engine is nice, and the cargo space is just right for a small family.  The fake color plastic bits by door window switches scratch very easily.

Great vehicle with a couple of small hiccups.  Had a minor issue with the AC but was resolved under warranty.  Replaced the driver's door speaker 3 times, also under warranty.  In fact, the stereo is a real weak point in the car for me.  Really lame speakers, and I paid for the ""upgrade.""  Seats are comfortable and fit my rather copious rump easily.  Plenty peppy even here in the high country of Colorado.  AWD system is very good, but the 2008 model lacks stability control.  Without it, the car's rear end can slip out if you aren't careful in the snow.  I'd buy the car again, though.",Really like the peppy engine.  Reliability has been great.  AWD is solid.  Seat bottom is long and supportive enough to make the car good for longer trips.  Sirius radio is a nice feature and worth the money.  Cargo space is excellent for a smaller SUV.  Fit & finish is very good overall.,"Speakers are a huge disappointment in a car this good.  Crummy, actually.  Will be buying aftermarket speakers now that I'm out of warranty.  Dealer tried to charge me $800 for the 30K service, but talked them down to $499.  Ripoff!  Don't be afraid to shop around."
4.375,Great Subaru,Carter ,02/16/2010,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Love this car.  Right before the major 2009 redesign they were making the nicest Forester they could.  Everything about the car feels tight and smooth.  I had a 2002 Outback before this car, and this car is much better.  The automatic and the 4 cyl. engine feel strong compared to the Outback's weak, noisy 4 cyl. and jerky manual transmission. The interior feels premium, with just a few hard plastics to distract.  Interior like a greenhouse with panoramic sunroof; bright and cheery in beige.","Great engine transmission.  Sharp and smooth responses to acceleration, steering and braking.  Heated everything.

Finally, I feel comfortable to say ""Yes, it is very dependable and reliable"". I don't feel stylish nor luxurious, however very humble and sort of old friend. As other review, engine sounds a bit loud and when I accelerate, response is a little slow/hesitant. Although I am not driving the fastest car...I will be on time and safe! That's all that counts!!!

4.25,Cold Start,High Plains Drifter ,06/18/2009,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,5,4,When I try to start it up in the morning it is noisy and has a rough idle. The shop has a bulletin for PZEV models that says ethanol in the gas will effect the engine this way on cold starts. All gas in this area has ethanol in it.

5,I love my car,Audrey ,06/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My husband and I really love this car.  It is the first Subaru we've owned, and we'll probably keep buying Subaru cars forever if they are like this one.  We've had it for 2 years, I love the turning radius on it (I can make u- turns on really narrow streets).  It's easy to handle.","The moonroof is my favorite, and I enjoy the spaciousness of the front passenger side on long car rides (I just put the seat all the way back and put my feet up on the dash and I'm so comfy)! We also like the Ipod hook up and extra spaces throughout to store things.","Better gas mileage (I'll always ask for that in any car though). I'm not sure if this can be improved, but when I went uphill on a very steep hill it rolled back a teensy bit (kind of scary when it happened)."
4.875,Best Car Ever Owned,Michigan Winters ,10/22/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is absolutely fantastic.  My Wife and I were looking for an AWD or 4x4 vehicle that could handle our tough Michigan Winters.  Along with that, we LOVE to travel.  This car fits the bill - it can outhandle snowy roads/ slushy roads/ muddy roads better than any truck or sports utility vehicle I know of.  Add the fact that I average around 28 mpg and it's quite the vehicle.  It's built with extreme quality, which in itself makes it look expensive.  It doesn't need the fancy bells and whistles.

5,On my radar since '98,B Noble ,08/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Finally, my '95 manual VW Jetta got tired and I could finally get my dream car, that I first saw debuted in '98 at the NYC auto show. It fit me like a glove. I'm (5'2"") and the driver's seat can be raised significantly with a touch of a power lever. Last April when I went looking to buy, I almost had a heart attack when I realized that the design of the '09 was seriously changed (not for the better) and it was bigger I didn't need bigger. I went hunting and had to purchase MY '08 a state away to get the one I wanted. I now have 3,000 miles on it and get 26+ mpg avg. It rides like a dream and I love the style of the dash board above all other new cars (including the Forester '09s). ",Good visibility from the windshield to the larger than avg. side view mirrors to the wide rear view window. Ease of the hatch door to open. The dark gray color and contrasting trim gives a handsome profile. I especially like the dashboard compartment for driver ease of reach.,"The arm rest between the two front seats is useless when the seat is moved forward for short people. Thus, I'd like to see fold down arm rests for two front seats it would be that much more luxurious on long trips that I do."
4.625,Can't get this car any more; too bad,osvolant ,08/02/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I love the turbo engine.  Getting 24 mpg routinely in suburban/highway driving.  Leather seats in Limited trim very comfortable and main reason I didn't buy the Sport.  Noisy at highway speeds.  Very practical for light off-roading, trailer towing, hauling bikes, dogs, etc. with enough zip to make it fun (more sports car than SUV feel). Good in snow and mud, even towing trailer.  Manual trans not available with turbo in '09- glad I got mine.","Turbo engine, sporty firm ride, crisp shifting manual trans.","Firmer brake pedal feel, less road noise, 6th gear ratio for lower engine rpms at 70+ mph."
4,Accelerator Problem,Sylvia Lucy ,06/28/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,2,5,4,5,There is one annoying problem that spoils the overall positive driving experience. The vehicle speeds up and slows down constantly while I try to hold a steady highway speed. The dealership ship says all the newer Foresters do that because of the computer settings. Subaru has made a flash program change computer settings for Impreza's that exhibited this problem but haven't gotten around to make a fix for the 2008 and 2009 Forester. I would suggest waiting until they have this problem solved before buying one.,"Small size, good visibility all around, manuverable. ",Fix the pulsing acceleration and deceleration problem. It will drive you nuts on a long trip.
3.625,Seconds Thoughts,Pencilpusher ,05/27/2008,,,5,5,3,3,,3,4,3,3,"Had a 2000 Forester. Got the 2008 with PZEV. Wish I could go back in time. The car idles wildly on start-up, reving up to 2000RPM then down so low it almost shuts off.  Told by dealer this is normal. He gave me a copy of a service bulletin saying same. Suggests using gas without ethanol. Good luck finding that in PA. On 90 degree turns vibrates and sounds like going over rumble strips.Told this is normal, seals in rear end need to seat. Car rattles and sounds tinny. Man, wish I had gotten the Nissan Rogue, even though it was $2000 more. The new Forester is built a lot cheaper than the 2000. Most reviews for Forester are very good. Hope mine holds up. ","Great visibility, runs well so far after initial start-up, handles nicely. Very similiar in styling to my 2000.  ",Either stop selling PZEV or make it so it runs on the gasoline available in the areas they sell the car. Improve the quality of door fit. Get rid of the incessant rattles.
5,Best Looking SUV,Bob Kelley ,05/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The lines on the car are classic, no swoops, triangular windows or forced styling gimmicks. Great visibilty and feelings of safety.

We started with a test drive of the new '09 Forester. We were really dissapointed. They just changed it too much. Luckily for us, the dealer still had a few new '08 Foresters on the lot. We snapped one up for $4K off of the sticker price. We love the look of the '08 better, and the front seats were much more comfortable. This car has plenty of power and good gas mileage for an AWD car. We couldn't be happier.","AWD, Subaru build quality and realiability, high quality interior","Better base stereo, slightly more leg room in the back (which the '09 has)."
5,Still a great little car,rickshift ,04/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have driven my Forester 6500 miles, so it is broken in by now. The gas mileage for an all wheel drive was good from the beginning but now as the weather is warming, I got just under 29 MPG on mixed commuter driving, I have yet to do an all highway drive. I drive into Boston to work, mostly on state route type roads, but I work nights so the traffic is mostly going the other way, at least in the morning. I love this car.

4.875,Excellent value,Minnie ,04/20/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I never considered a Subaru until looking at all the others and not finding what I wanted.  As soon as I sat in my LL Bean Forester I was hooked.  Everything felt right.  I love the AWD,  the sunroof is amazing especially at night on our country roads with stars twinkling overhead,  the heated seats are great,  the wood accents on steering wheel and shifter make it look rich,   and it handles like a dream. You'd never think this car is a 4 cyl as it has lots of power. Getting 26-28 MPG with just over 3500 miles on her.  I'll never own anything else.

The Sports XT trim level changes the overall appearance of a Forester very nicely. Many cool STi features, like wheels, spoilers, pedals, etc. The turbo is a blast! I am getting 23 MPG using premium, but I also flex the turbo at every opportunity. Build quality seems good, the car runs pretty quiet overall, and reliability is rumored to be very good.","Sports trim level, turbo, hood scoop, moonroof, aux input. Stereo also sounds good with subwoofer; you can hear it easily with the windows and moonroof open.","Back seat is a tight squeeze. Rear seats don't fold perfectly flat.

3.875,My first SUV,Jan ,04/03/2008,,,3,4,4,3,,5,4,3,5,I purchased my very first new vehicle ever just a couple of days ago and I think it is wonderful. I haven't had it long enough to really comment on the gas mileage but my old car only got 15 miles/gal so this is a dream. The SUV handles very well and my children love it. It has plenty of room my husband is a very large man about 350 lb. And he fits in the vehicle just fine. I would recommend them to anyone.,"Power doors, windows, and storage.",As said before the locks should automatically lock when the vehicle is placed in gear. Power seats on all models standard both passenger and driver. When creating a better version keep in mind what people would ask for and make all those features standard. I know cost goes up but it's worth it.

5,First Time Forester,pico ,02/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Best driving ""small SUV"" of the RAV4, CRV bunch, even with base engine. There is no comparison.  Even in base X form the handling is awesome, confidence inspiring.  Turns are crisp, stopping/starting all great.  Drove both XT and normally aspirated and was pleasantly surprised with the pull of the base engine. Interior is also roomier than expected, back seat is roomy enough if the front seats aren't pushed all the way back but even if they are I feel I have just enough legroom with front seats at maximum travel. Love the height of the cabin plus the tall stance.  And in terms of AWD systems, there is no comparison (especially with these Colorado winters we've been having).  ","Extra large moonroof, two sunglass case holders, copious amounts of storage, bins, tall ride height, handling, fuel economy. Long seat cushions give good thigh support. Styling is handsome inside and out, not overly-styled and extremely functional; turn signals in the mirrors are a classy touch",I think Subaru nailed it with the Forester.  Would have liked leather without the LLBean package but Premium package had all I wanted anyway (heated seats/mirrors/windshield). Maybe a smidgen more rear seat room and ground clearance would be nice but I know all that's been fixed with the 2009 model

Where I drove the Volvo, the Subaru I just drive; I'm much more in tune with the road, and quite happy with less mass to maneuver (especially parallel parking). My daughter drove it yesterday and commented ""It's like driving a go cart!""  My wife is on her second of two Foresters, so I knew what I was getting. Hers have been the base model; I am SO glad I spent the extra $1500 on the Premium package. She's already put dibs on the '08 when I move on in two years!

However, so far I really like the car.  It is fun to drive and performs very well.  As everyone else has already said the backseats are very small but I will always be sitting in the driver's seat so what does it matter?  This is my first car.  I have always owned trucks before but with the cost of gasoline and me living half way up a mountain I needed an efficient AWD.  The Subaru fit the bill.

The premium package makes it feel like a luxury car, but the price I paid for it did not! Since the Forester has been around for several years, the familiar technology made me feel more comfortable knowing I wasn't buying a new model or redesigned model that may have had problems. The other car makes I considered before purchasing the Subaru had too many recalls. The Subaru is fun to drive. ","The 6-disc player and sunroof are my favorite features. Power driver's seat is great. Also, I didn't think I would like the heated seats, but after trying them a few times, they are nice. The rear bumper protector is also nice. Newport Blue is such a great color! ",Stability control should be standard on all models. Side curtain airbags would be a plus in addition to the seat airbags.

Drives very well, was pleasantly surprised by handling on winding roads during test drive. Has small exterior dimensions but has well designed and comfortable interior.    Got the WR blue and realized that it resembles Thomas the train which my son loves.","Seats, interior finish, price, torque, ride, predicted reliability record from CR.  Cool allow wheels for the sports model.  It is fun to drive.","Gas mileage, put rear discs in sports model, providfe side curtain airbags option, and navigation options for those who want a back up camera. Wished the rear wheel wells did not take as much trunk space away, but a cargo rack solves this. "
4.75,Wonderful Go Anywhere Vehicle,Awake in Seattle ,08/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Had my doubts as to how refined the Forester would be coming from an '02 Infiniti G20. But I was pleasantly surprised by the solidity and finish of this vehicle. The size is just right for our soon-to-be 3-person household and the volume of the trunk cargo area is very useful. The fabric of the seats seems very durable, interior plastics are of reasonably high quality, and the dark gray color us nice. Visibility is excellent and the turning radius is nice-n-tight for in-city driving/parking (trust me, this does matter). The stereo speakers could use a little more low end oomph, road noise is bit loud, and the seats are not as comfortable as our Infititi  but otherwise we love our new Subie.","Exterior size and shape, alloy wheels, leather steering wheel/shifter/hand brake, solidity, all-wheel drive, storage capacity, CD changer, seat fabric, visibility, turning radius, projected reliability, dealer experience, large side mirrors, compass.","A little more leg room in rear, reduce road noise, better stock stereo speakers, make front/rear disc brakes standard on all models."
