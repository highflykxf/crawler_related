There's room for outings with friends, and can fit my bass gear for practice and small shows. The seats are comfortable for me and any friends under 6'2. Remember it's a little sports car.

3.625,Turbocharged practicality,johnkit1 ,01/17/2012,,,3,3,4,4,,4,3,4,4,"This is the sort of car you can buy if you want something fun to drive yet also want the ability to haul things or people. Depending on who you are talking to, you could presumably describe two entirely different cars without lying. If I were talking to my mom, it's a cute people hauler with 60/40 split rear seats and plenty of cargo space. If I were describing it some guy while filling my car -- yeah -- it's a turbo. And no, I don't want to race your SRT-4. Either way, it's quirky enough to make daily driving interesting while lacking some of the gaudy plastic bits that adorn performance variants of other manufacturers. ","The gauge cluster can be toggled to between red and blue. Decent acceleration in stock form. The glove compartment is ridiculously deep for some reason which is good for holding things (so is the rest of the car, it's like a station wagon). Stock wheels fit the look of the car well.

Mazda seems to be able to focus on what's important while having enough little problems to give the car personality. If you buy a car like you would buy a fridge, you will want to look at something more prudent. Perhaps a Kia?","There are little problems everywhere. There is front strut noise in cold (-15c or below) weather. The mazdaspeed embossed door sill plate is coming loose on the passenger side. Lumbar seat support is only somewhat functional. The retractable key only opens sometimes, perhaps as a rudimentary form of theft protection. 

Mazda obviously thinks they are above doing the little things right. Despite improvements over the cheaper models, especially the front seats, the econobox origin of this car is firmly present in the mazdaspeed model."

You never forget that you are driving a Japanese tuner car. There is a lot of engine drone in the cabin and if you roll the windows down it gets even louder. I can take about every corner you can think of and still not lose control. It is front wheel drive so if you go up against a new WRX or EVO you will lose, but not by much. Not to mention this car brand new is about 5K less than those. For the money you get all kinds of fun. Anyone looking to by a practical, fast, stick shift car, the speed3 is your best bet.

The 6-speed shifts smoothly, and the clutch has a progressive take- up (although a bit of slippage is sometimes necess). Seats are great.  Trip computer is handy.

I can putt putt to work and enjoy the burbling sound, effortless torque and 25 mpg. I can step on it for a Sunday drive and enjoy great acceleration, cornering and responsiveness (though the steering feel is a bit numb and effort a bit too high). It is especially fun in the winter! With aftermarket wheels and full snow tires, the steering lightens up, the ride softens, and pushing the limits is fun. Whether it caries the cross country skis, golf clubs, or family, this car provides inconspicuous pleasures.

It has a ridiculous amount of mid-range torque and can handle high speed corners extremely well.  It is also great to live with everyday.  I was smiling the whole test drive.

4.625, The all-purpose sportscar!,Rob ,03/01/2010,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"   Outside of a 2009/2010 Subaru WRX, nothing comes close to an all-purpose sports car than this little 2008 MS3 rocket ... and it looks so innocent! When it was purchased in 2008, the 2008 Subaru was not a performance match to this car, and it was over $2000. more than the Mazdaspeed 3 GT.    Easy decision then and I'm glad I made it. It performs well in interior space for moderate hauling of things while having decent space for two adults in the back seat and loads of headroom in the front seat. All of this with great road-holding, good steering feel, great brakes and lot's and lot's of power ... almost too much torque for the front wheel drive ... but much fun to drive in spite of it.","A pure sleeper with the looks of a (gulp) small station wagon - but with the tire grip, handling and power of a good $40K sportscar. Virtually no turbo lag so it feels like a small potent V8 in a 3200 pound car while the cornering power and brakes are better than my old 2004 RSX Type-S ... sweet!","Use the power after the car is rolling or you'll find the biggest gripe - the torque steer and (if it's wet out) the wheel hop. Anywhere it gets below 50 degrees, you do need all-weather tires as a cold weather tire. Otherwise, my only complaint is the inaccuracy of the trip computer for mileage. "

I enjoy tricking out cars and have added many upgrades to this vehicle. It responds very well to mods and it ridiculously fast. People will talk trash and compare speed to a 350Z. Having had modded versions of this car and modded 350Z this car is definitely faster, the turbo is what seals the deal and sounds great when you open it up and mod it with a louder intake system and bypass valve. The 350Z is of course more sporty looking and RWD and a coupe, but having upgraded to this being my first 4-door car, I was pleasantly happy with my purchase.",The turbo sounds great when you add a few mods to the motor. It is very responsive to mods. It is very fast and can hang with the best of them. The interior and build quality is top notch and does not appear to be cheap in any way. This car is a great deal for the price it costs to buy one.,"I would love to have seen a 2-door coupe option. Also a stock front-mount intercooler would have been aesthetically pleasing compared to the hidden top mounted one.

It's definitely the great value that everyone has said it is and yet lately I have found myself at dealerships in search of a step up.  The car is fast but the ride and handling don't reach my previous VR6 Jetta, driving experience despite more speed and power.  The torque steer is enormous comparatively and the ride and handling are not up to par.  I also happen to be an audio nut and the Bose sound system is quite awful.  The speakers sounded crappy, the bass bloated and the system has a noise circuit that makes the volume fluctuate uncontrollably.

It is VERY quick and the rush you feel when the turbo kicks in doesn't grow old, and neither when it corners or brakes; this is a very competent car and it's nice they can sell it this cheap.  But when you don't want to dance, it will take you home without fuss; The vast amount of torque lets you be lazy and it feels no different than it's non speed brother.  I've had no mechanical issues, and love the Alcantara/leather seats, and also it's cargo capacity (40 inch flat screen tv in its box?? no problem).  After an unreliable and slow car, this car is what I dreamed it would be. ","Power, braking and handling. Practicality, reliability and understated good looks. ","The engine is a bit thirstier than I expected for 100% city driving, but that's about it.

There is so many good things to say about this little ROCKET, and so few negative. The take off in this thing is amazing. If you need to get out in traffic, it's not a problem whatsoever. As far as gas mileage is concerned, I am getting 24.1 in town, and that's jumping out at every red light. I drive within the speed limits, but it's fun to rocket yourself as quick as possible to that speed limit. The last car I owned was a Pontiac Grand Prix GT. That car I thought was pretty quick, at about 200 Horse power. When I saw that the Speed3 had 263 stock, I was floored! What a RUSH","How it forces you back into the seat when you punch it! The dash lights, the head lights, automatic wipers are cool. The 6 speed. The 18 inch rims. The media input for my Zune to play through the speakers, that's cool. Controls on the steering wheel. I can go on and on, but there is not enough room.","Although I have the Bose system in this car, it doesn't sound as good as it did in my Pontiac. Sound system needs improvement.

A sleek hatchback design, 18"" alloy wheels, humming sport-exhaust, all wrapped around a intercooled, 4 cyl turbo cranking out 263hp, doing 5.45 sec from 0-60 mph.  The ride is the most responsive handling experience I have ever incurred. I sell cars, and drive BMWs, VWs, Mercedes, etc., day in and day out. Only the high end Lexus GS, and C350 AMG move like this car (however not nearly as agile)  Buy this car if you like sportscars with room for 4 (comfortably), a tape-measure turning radius, and getting sucked back into your seat going from 80-110 mph. Bottom line: the MS3 has the best horsepower:cost ratio (faster than the R32, GTI, Si,& Caliber SRT-4).","Favorite features on my new MS3 include: 18"" alloy wheels, scooped hood design, Xenon High Intensity Discharge headlights (Auto-Off), and modified rear spoiler.  My favorite things include the soothing hum of the exhaust, uber-responsive steering/handling, and the endless amounts of acceleration!!","My improvements would include upping the power/capability of the Bose stereo (only 212 watts), making a sun/moonroof available, 100% leather interior w/heated seats available, and a thicker tire, smaller (i.e. 17"") wheel to ease the bumpiness (or loosen the suspension a smidgen).

I chose the speed3 after driving both and simply enjoyed the fun factor and economy of a sporty car that has all the details I hold dear. The interior is excellent, design outstanding. The firm ride makes for confident handling, the engine a superb powerhouse or a fuel sipper depending on how you drive it. I can trundle along at normal speed and save the gas, but if I need some passing power, it amazes with its pickup that never ends. The torque will pull strongly in any gear and turbo lag is minimal and predicable. I cannot find any other vehicle for the money that gives so much.

The car is just all around fun to drive, and with the hatch and the fact that it makes its power from the turbo charger, it's practical too!  My only real complaint is the transmission.

The '09 model WRX-GT isn't available yet and the present is a boring compared to our old one.  The HHR SS was a player, but not as available on the lots and prices are higher because of it.  Mini Cooper S looks dated and could be only worse in 5 years.  The is the one left standing.

Acceptable mileage as well.","Auto HID headlights, rain-sensing wipers. THE MOTOR! Fit and finish. Great interior and room. Six-disk MP3 player. Handling and power.

4.875,Long term review,Will Hussein Rockwel ,06/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've owned this car for 5 months now, so we'll call this a long term road test. The Mazdaspeed has baggage room and comfort to keep the wife and kids happy, and performance to satisfy the Wild Child inside of me that just won't grow up. I owned a 5.0 Mustang and missed its raw power when I bought an Eclipse GT. Now the Eclipse is gone and the power is back, in spades. The Mustang didn't handle curves well, the Speed will go as hard as I dare, I've never come close to finding its limit on a curvy road. If you look up ""bang for the buck"" on Wikipedia, there should be a picture of this car next to it.","Warning light that tells me when tire pressure is low, big button that manages climate control based on temperature you set, MP3 input so you can plug your iPod or phone into the car stereo, BIG glove box that holds a lot",Somehow I miss third gear a lot when driving aggressively. I wish the headlights turned off automatically. I wish the door locks would disengage when you are stopped and try to open the door. I wish the turbo didn't use gasoline.
4.625,3 is a hot little number,Dave ,06/30/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I've had a number of sports cars over the years, including Corvettes, M3s and others.  This thing is in a class by itself in terms of the cost/benefit equation.  For street driving, it will do 95% of what those other cars will do, and at half the price.  It gives me a big smile each time I drive it, and think about how little money I paid for the performance I'm getting.  Highly recommended. ","Engine, handling, very reasonable fuel mileage (23 average)","Not much; get rid of the torque steer, but that's darn near physically impossible."
4.875,What a great car!!,Sam ,06/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought this car about 2 weeks ago, and just finished break in. Before I bought this car, I had to decide about sport or comfort. I chose the sporty features of the vehicle. This car is a pure fun to drive sport car. Handling is excellent, and power is off the hook. Even though it is in 6th gear in about 40mph, it jumps up to 70 mph very easily. It is very pleasure to see and drive this vehicle everyday. It's turbo boost starts about 3000 but that doesn't mean that this car have a turbo leg. I test drove GTI before I bought this car, and GTI had a some turbo legs. It is a true sport car with most of comforts you want.","Turbo (big power), nicely tuned suspension.","Auto door lock, sunroof."
4.875,Red Rocket,Dano ,06/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I'm an admitted car nut and have had the opportunity to drive quite a few performance vehicles over the years. With all things considered, the Mazdaspeed3 comes out at the top of the heap when it comes to performance, cost and comfort. I just knew I had to have one when the car salesman punched the accelerator for the first time during my test drive! ZOOM, ZOOM!","The turbo-charged engine, silly! Accommodates a family of four, exhaust note, seats, 18-inch wheels, Solo Cup red paint, limited production. The exterior styling is not too much nor too little. Anyone who knows cars can tell that the MS3 is something special. I could go on.","Mazda scaled back their warranty coverage. I traded a 2003 Mazda Protege 5 which had, I think, a 4- or 5-year 50,000-mile warranty. Then again, 3 year, 36K is fairly standard."
4.875,A near perfect practical sportscar,smiling face ,06/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The biggest surprise, even for those who have read road tests on this car, is the huge amount of torque once behind the wheel. Just stepping into it moderately in 2nd, 3rd or 4th gear it reminds me so much of a '67 Mustang 390 I once owned. But, compared to that ancient beast, this little jewel is light years ahead in practicality. And it is mega-light years ahead in handling, cornering power, braking and steering response. In summary, this is a confidence-building and unfinicky sportscar with very good seats, great comfort amenities for its price, a very useable back seat area (when in place) with lots of hauling room by folding the seats down - a near perfect practical sportscar to me!","Absolutely incredible roadholding grip with excellent steering response to go with the macho-torque on the stock summer Bridgestones at 50 degrees or warmer. To enjoy this year-round in the snow belt though, I had to get a second set of tires/wheels - 225/40 all season Potenzas on Enkeis.  ","In or near this price range - very few cars come close to comparing to the MS3. It would be nice to have a little better gas mileage (18-20mpg around town - although 28 mpg on one trip), but my only complaint so far is the trip computer is off by at least 10% on each fill-up from the actual mpg!

Acceptable mileage since my other vehicle is a Dodge Ram. Love the auto A/C and wipers. Awesome torque! Practical as well, with the rear hatch. The audio system is superb. Anyone looking for a reasonably inexpensive and practical road rocket -- this is it.","The auto A/C, headlights and wipers. The sound system, and the practicality.

4.75,Terrific car for the price,MSITOOLLADY ,05/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"So far no problems. Has awesome pickup, handles just fine. Fun to drive. This car is perfect. If you want to go slow and save on fuel you can but, if you want to go it is right there with you. No trouble passing, taking bends, stopping is great too. I think the way everything is set up inside is great, do not change it. Love the cup holders in the doors in the back especially. It is great for my children. The seats are firm but give great support in all areas. The material is easy to clean when needed. I love my color mica blue. The seats are two toned which adds character to the car. I always liked hatchbacks. And this is not your typical one. If you want a sports car  drive this first.  ","Two toned seats, controls on the steering wheel, the dash, the cup holders,  extra large glove box,the set up of all controls, the lighting in the dash, roominess in the back seat, cargo room for the size of the car.",PLEASE put in a better radio and a sunroof.

4.625,Amazing performance for the price,Colorado Driver ,05/11/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,3,5,"I was leaning toward getting a Lexus IS 250 or an Audi 4 when on a whim I stopped by a Mazda dealership. I drove an RX-8, which I loved, but I live in Colorado and it's really not a practical winter car. So a friend suggested I try the Speed3.  This thing is an absolute blast to drive. Performance-wise, it's very comparable to a BMW 328 -- it's impossible to tell it's a front-wheel drive car. You can go 80 in third if you want, you can take curves at 60 with no sway at all, or you can drive it sedately and still get a fun drive and pretty decent gas mileage. Plus it seats four adults very comfortably, and of course the hatch is convenient for hauling stuff.  Great car at a great price.","Engine, transmission, steering, brakes, styling, Bose sound system (note: the sound system had to fixed on all 2008 1/2 GT models -- make sure they've made the repair on the one you're buying or you'll have to take it in to get it replaced.","Really nothing except it's annoying they put a sound system that didn't work into the new GTs -- required taking the car to the dealership twice to get it replaced: once to figure out what precise replacement it needed, and once for an hour to make the switch. Other than that, awesome car."
5,"Sporty, Great Performance!",yzfr1 ,04/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Unbelievable acceleration and handling for a sport wagon.  Great gas milage if you're not a lead-foot.  The Metro-Grey-Mica is an excellent color. I've always been a Mazda fan.  I've test drove a lot of different cars before I decided to buy the MS3.  By a long shot, this car won me over.  Best bang for your buck as many others have said. There are so many upgrades that you can do with this car if you have the extra $$.  I couldn't be happier with the purchase of this car.  I got the GT model by the way.  I really liked the leather and red stitching seats, steering wheel, and shift stick.  Keep the MS3s coming to North America!",Everything!!  What's not to like?,
4.875,Excellent car for the money,Ray ,04/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"First, my other car is an 06 Infiniti G35 coupe loaded. Great solid car and fun to drive. The ONLY draw back is it really has 2 seats and we need more. I do not want to give up my G35 and my wife does not drive. After A LOT of research and test driving the MazdaSpeed 3 gives me everything my G35 has to offer plus the ability to seat 4. So I get to keep my G35 and now I have another sports car that does everything very well. Actually, I enjoy driving my SPD3 now more then the G35. I don't feel like I'm missing anything when I drive the SPD3. My wife loves it too.","Seats, turbo, 6 disc mp3 player, ipod aux jack. Interior lights at night.

I've never had a car before that seems to fit the driver like a glove.  This one does.  As for performance, I'm extremely impressed.  I've had a Mazda MX-6 GT and a Volvo S70 T5 with turbos before, but neither of them could touch the MazdaSpeed 3.  This car seems to know what you're thinking at any given time and just does it almost instantly.  Truthfully, this car is just a bit smaller than I'd like, and I actually prefer the overall styling of the Mazda 6.  But sadly, there's no MazdaSpeed 6 anymore, so this was my next choice.  And I'm very happy with it overall.",Engine/performance. 6-speed manual transmission. Handling - extremely tight/responsive. Sporty styling. Still somewhat practical.  ,"Interior clock extremely slow -- shows about 1 minute behind every day after reset (friend with Mazda 3 has same problem).

4.875,2008 MAZDASPEED3 GT,zappa ,03/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5," After driving the usual suspects, WRX, GTI, Civic Si, etc., I found the MazdaSpeed3 the best bang for buck. The car is very, very fast, once you get into 3rd gear the car explodes. Handles amazing as well. The GT interior is very nice, the seats are very form fitting and comfortable. The Bose system sounds great. The xenon headlights are great at night.  The fuel economy is fine for the speed of the car, I'm not sure how people expect a car to be a sub-15 second 1/4 mile car and get 28 around town. I average 21-22 around town and 25+ on the highway. For a car this fast that is very good.  Handles Colorado in the winter nice enough."," Speed, 6speed, handling, stereo. The turbo is very nice, you can keep the car under 3000 rpm and drive it nice or kick it over 3000 and let it rip. Very nice car to have as a daily driver. Can tear it up or drive nicely. ", Nicer interior would be OK but Mazda has done a great job of providing nice features and comfort to go with the speed. And keeping the car under 25k. Theres nothing for this price that combines all the features that this does. All weather tires would be a nice option as well.
5,Express Commuter,WUENSCHO ,03/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am in the car business and work at a Honda dealer, but the SPEED3 was my only consideration. Faster then the Civic Si, and much more practical in the hatch body. Build quality is on par with the best Japan has to offer. I get 28 MPG on a 48 mile one way commute with a small amount of town driving, if I keep my foot out of the turbo. But when I need to go, (or just want to), very few cars give you this kind of thrill. Handling is superb, braking is outstanding. The only things missing are heated mirrors and seats, and if you like them, a sunroof. It even did OK in a snowstorm with the summer tires. If you want serious preformance, good gas milage, practcality, and quality, look no farther.","Power, handling gas milage and seats.

4.75,Practically Wild,New Mazdaspeed Freak ,02/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This car may be the perfect combination of  practical features and all-out performance. I owned a few BMWs prior to buying the Speed 3 in November, and while the Mazda doesn't quite measure up to the Bimmers' build quality or luxury, it is surprisingly adequate in both areas.  I will probably keep this car forever as nothing even remotely close to its price is appreciably faster and nothing this fun to drive has as much utility.","There are many: the ferocious boost under full-throttle acceleration, freeway passing power, lovely seats, nice interior, exhaust note, reasonable fuel economy, and stealth look. Also, how did I ever live without a hatch?","Wider stock tires as the traction is easily overwhelmed despite the excellent traction control.  This car should have eight-inch wide wheels and 235 tires.  I prefer rear-wheel drive, but that would change the nature of the car."
4.5,Best Bang for the Buck!,Howard ,01/20/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"If you haven't heard, the Mazdaspeed 3 is one of the best bangs for the buck.  The turbocharged 2.3L engine is smooth and responsive, but power falls off above 5500rpm. Handling is nice and tight, with the ride being borderline over dampened. Interior quality is good, but I have encountered a noisy seat belt buckle which was easily fixed.  The car is just too much fun to drive. Its the ultimate compromise between a sporty car with utility, at a great price.",The 2.3L DISI turbo engine. Performance per dollar. ,Improved gas mileage. Interior could be made with nicer materials. Shocks could be softened in the rear.  AWD option would be nice.
4.875,Totally And Pleasantly Surprised,putinbaytr3 ,01/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I was initially skeptical concerning my wife's insistance on a Mazda3 to replace her aging and self destructing PT Cruiser.  After some study and talking with a retired Ford engineer I went for it and upped the ante to the Mazdaspeed 3.  I have never been so pleasantly surprised.  After 61 years I have had a lot of high performance cars and the Mazdaspeed 3 gives us more performance and sheer fun for dollar spent than anything previous.  I expected a much cheaper constructed and engineered vehicle.  It is every bit the performance car it has been written up to be.  If the top went down I would even perfer it over my Honda S2000.  Torque steer is minimal and the power band is excellent. ,"Fun to drive, power for any driving occasion.  The seating is excellent  and the Bose stereo is better than expected.  ",I think the shifter mechanism could use some improvement and I would offer a high performance all-season tire for northern climates.  I had to search ebay for a set of oem wheels so I could have winter tires.  I would like to see the sunroof as an option for non tracked cars.

Body is aggressive yet tasteful, and the 18"" wheels and larger spoiler distinguish this car.  The controls are intuitive and there are many luxury features (i.e. auto a/c, 6 CD changer, Bose stereo, steering wheel controls, auxiliary input jack).  The seats feel awesome and hug your body.  The performance speaks for itself.  Great handling, ridiculous amounts of torque, all around solid feel on the road.  My only complaint is low gas mileage 16 city, 25 hwy. However, bottom line, I love the car.","Leather seats w/mesh inserts to reduce stickyness in summer, red-lit instruments w/ blue backlight, the power, halogen headlights w/height control.","This car needs better gas mileage.

4.875,Been waiting for months to get this car,Greg Stinson ,09/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I waited for 4 months to get a black grand touring. I figured the extra 2 grand was worth it for the leather, stereo, Xenons, LEDs etc. The car drives perfectly. It sits low and has tight steering. It's my first turboed car and it packs a wallop. 2nd - 4th gears throw you back. Going from 5th to 6th when merging today was great. It went 60-80 in what felt like no time at all. Finally a car that makes my daily drives fun. Gas mileage on the premium fuel and tire prices are gonna be nasty, but it's all worth it.","Adj Xenons, the interior and exterior styling is amazing, the power, the steering, the stereo, the wagon functionality, red stitching, aluminum pedals, the seats, the glovebox is huge, it basically is the perfect car.",Larger more spread out speedometer.

I am in the Salt Lake Valley.  I have taken it around I15 up to Heber City and down through Provo Canyon.  This car can run at any gear as long as you have it in the correct rpms (3000-5500); short band width but she is a beast in that range.  Be careful I have also received my first ticket; I wasn't even driving hard, I was talking on my phone and before I knew it I was going 20 over.  I am 21 and can't say there is a better car, the closest would be the Subaru WRX, but also 2k more and everyone and their mom has one.  ","All the power, yeah baby!! The interior is nice, stereo is good enough for me, I'm sure the GT with the Bose is way better, but for the price my sport will have to do.  Mazda seems to be a pretty reliable brand and no aftermarket parts needed to make this car a real fast baby.","I wouldn't have minded a stiffer suspension, I'm coming from a Civic Si 03.  I could have taken corners in my Civic at 15-20 mph faster but didn't have the power.  Insurance will likely double over my previous Civic.  Oh well not really something Mazda can do, but good to know."
