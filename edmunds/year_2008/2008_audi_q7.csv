5,Best vehicle I've owned!,Ben ,08/29/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I've owned 3 Japanese cars, 2 Americans, and this SUV by far is the best vehicle I've driven. It is so enjoyable and comfortable. Besides the fact that it drinks more gas than my dad drink his beers in a week, the Q7 is a fantastic vehicle. Just one thing, WHY THE HELL AUDI DOESN'T HAVE A REGULAR AUX PORT LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD? I have to open the iPod box every time and it's just not very convenient. Other than that, I have no complaint about this beautiful SUV.",,
3,"115,000 miles and still ticking.",Don ,11/24/2015,3,2,3,,,3,3,3,4,,,"The cupholders are placed in a terrible location, making spills into the navigation controls inevitable, as they are located just below the cupholders.  Even a minor spill into the system causes it to short out.  I have already replaced two and it looks like I have another problem.  The electronics should be better insulated to allow for occasional spills.  Better yet, move the cupholders to a less vulnerable location.For the second time, I am experiencing rips in the leather seating.  I have never had this problem with other cars, including my 15-year old Beetle with leather seats.  And no, I don't carry knives or screwdrivers in my back pockets.  Just had to replace the battery, which is located under the passenger side front seat, which needs to be removed to get to the battery compartment.  Ridiculously expensive for labor.  Audi wanted around $600 for replacement.  Had it done at my local foreign car repair shop for $380.",,

I drive a lot of highway miles so it was out of warranty.The lane side assist went out, the latch for the rear moonroof broke ($900.00 for a latch!) & in November 2010 the heat went out, only on the drivers side, then both motors on the mirros went out at a cost of over $300.00 each.It is now January 2012 & I am still dealing with heat issues after spending $1500.00 in repairs it still doesn't work properly, sometimesnot at all.Now my remote is beginning to fail.I have spent the last 15 months dealing with failures & expenses.I'm done!

3.5,Noisy engine,Cubano ,05/02/2010,,,5,4,2,2,,4,5,3,3,"The reliability has been poor, the worst of any vehicle a have owned. Had to tow it to the dealer in my first week of ownership, the engine just stopped running. Front bearing gone at 25,000 KM. Driver door keeps dropping, it has been fixed 3 times. Other problems, way too many. Frustrating. I find the V6 quite noise even below 2000 RPM; makes more  noise than my brother in law Ford Escape. Dealer service could be better","Good looks, comfortable, roomy, glamorous, good brakes. If you are willing to put up with frequent problems, and a very noisy engine, go for it.","Audi should have better reliability. My 10 years old  BMW 3 series has had fewer problems than my 2 years old Q7. The engine of a 70000 $ car should not sound like a Dodge Neon, that is unacceptable."
3.375,Tonka toy with a great ride,Stoak ,12/04/2009,,,4,4,2,2,,4,4,3,4,To  be honest we have not had big problems just lots of little ones. The gas cap cover is pathetic and the lock is a joke - open it with your fingers when locked. With kids and pets it seems impossible to not knock water etc over in the center console which ruins the electronics. Part of the body is simply falling off. This is our 4th audi and we have not looked anywhere else simply because of the way we were treated. This too has declined - still pretty good just less than their usual stellar. In 2 years the seat leather has developed a large long crack in it - our 10 year old a6 is still fine.,"Handling was far better than most comparable SUVs we test drove. When an Acura needed to do a 3 point turn the Audi simply turned around. We live in Alaska and it is stellar in ice, snow, slush and bumpy roads. ",Fix everything stated above. Engine is fine and the drive is nice. 
4,So Far So Good,2008 Q7 ,11/26/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,4,4,2,4,"Good car so far. Lots of comments on the great looks. No major issues to date. Ready for new tires at 27K. Brakes are coming. Pull a 5000lb boat with some difficulty. Pulls well up to about 50mph then struggles trying to maintain 60mph+, even on the slightest hill. I manually shift to keep the gearing correct or the engine just rev's really high. Recommend the 3.0 TDI or the 4.2 V8 if you plan to pull more than 3000lbs.  My biggest beef is the lack of a rear hatch close feature on the key fob.  Audi seems to think your hands are full when loading, but not full when unloading.  Can't reach the button with full hands. Wife wants another when the lease is up. Probably the TDI Prestige. ","Looks, Bose stereo is good, interior fit, finish and ergonomics.  Heated seats.","Electric rear hatch needs a close button inside and on the key fob.  Especially on the key fob.  Ride is a little harsh (20"" wheels) and the exhaust/engine noise can get annoying.  Needs more sound dampening, but not a major issue."

This car has been a nightmare.  Brakes started screeching at 2000 miles and in the 2.5 years that I have owned this car, it has been at the dealer over 20 times (excluding scheduled maintenance).  The starter has been replaced twice which requires the entire engine to be pulled from the vehicle (nice design).  Audi does have roadside assistance which is nice since I have had to utilize this service 6 times to have the vehicle towed to the dealer.  The Q7 S-line is a cool looking SUV, if the cool design does not turn heads, the screeching brakes will!", ,
4.625,Loving it,eplots ,01/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"I've had this vehicle now for about 9 months and completely love it. Mine has most of the extra bells and whistles, and I have been totally spoiled by the features - even the ones I thought I'd never use (keyless entry/start, lane assist, back up camera).  With the 21 inch wheels this thing corners and handles more like a sports car than a SUV. But the beefy curb weight (while providing for a sense of security and impervious-ness-ity) definitely makes for less than thrilling accelerations. I expected this though when I bought it, so no surprises there. A few minor issues with squealing brakes and the like have been promptly handled by Audi care and all-in-all I am very happy with my Q7.",Keyless start/entry. Handling with the 21 inch tires. Look/feel of s-line. Feeling of security. Technological features ,"Lane assist only works above 35 MPH not sure I agree with that ""safety"" feature. Cup holder positioning kind of stinks. Back window that opens would be nice. My (yes, I know it's trendy) iPhone has a better navigation system.  Wish you could get the back-up camera without it. "
4.5,Disappointed,disappointed ,12/10/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,Love the car except the electronics. Console buttons shorted out from windex used to clean off finger prints. Really bad design as the buttons are not sealed and will short out with only a couple of drops.  Audi will not stand behind. Cost $1000 to replace in the first 6 months. Afraid to use the cup holders that are located above the elect. 2 drops and another $1000. pule the hassle. Want my Range Rover back. ,,Fix the electronics. They should be sealed and protected from moisture better.
4.875,"Great machine, but not options",Lesio ,10/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have Q7 Premium S-line 4.2, absolutely great, fun to drive.  But, it would not be so great without all features. In my opinion adaptive air suspension is a must, adaptive cruise control is fun, great help, but be careful, it provides safety, but stay alert, in critical situations you need to take over. Parking sensors is also a must with such relatively large vehicle. The line assist possible saved me already from couple of dangerous situations and side assist also, although it takes some effort to learn to look at it.  A lot of features and after 5 months I am still discovering how to use them in concert effectively.  Tested BMW X5 (too small) and Merc. GL550, did not like the controls",Adaptive air suspension.

3.5,Disappointed,Stephanie ,09/06/2008,,,2,4,4,3,,4,4,3,4,"My husband purchased this car for me and traded in our A4 cab for it. I loved it at first. Then a month into ownership, the trunk latch broke. It wouldn't close all the way so I had to drive the hour away to the nearest dealership (twice) to get it fixed. 2 weeks ago, my MMI system stopped working and it was stuck to only play CDs. I took it in today and was told you're out of luck because you spilled something on it. Had I known this was such a common problem, I wouldn't have bought this car. Now I have to shell out the money out of pocket to replace the MMI system. After reading a bunch of reviews, it seems to be an extremely common problem. ",,
5,Great fun machine in mountains,balloonman ,09/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Drove  4700 miles from Ohio to Wyoming and Montana, thru Chief Joseph highway and Beartooth pass. Typtronic tranmission was spectacular in moving through the passes, hair-pin turns and altitudes over 11000 ft. Six passengers very comfortable. Gas mileage acceptable and with hi speed western states 75mph limits a real dream to drive. Rear camera very helpful in parallel parking and in exiting parking lots. The water bottle storage in the doors was easy access and convienent. Air conditioning throughout the whole car was effictive. Access to rear seats challenging but once seated, very comfortable. Great car for a great trip.",Dynamic look. Stable at high speeds. Water bottle storage in doors a great idea.

5,Car Seat in the Center Rear,LA Mom ,08/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love the car but am so disappointed that with a Britax diplomat infant rear-facing seat (one of the smallet, most narrow on the market) installed in the center position (the safest), I can only use one of the two adjacent seats. The other is unusable because you cannot access the seat belt buckle!  Even in my old A6 wagon this was not a problem. Further, with a carseat in the center location, it is impossible to move the seats forward to access the third row. You can move the carseat to the left or right but then your two rear passengers (imagine grandma and grandpa) are squished together and the one in the center has a very small seat. This is a silly problem to have in an SUV.",I love everything but the carseat issue. I suggest you try your carseat(s) before you buy this car.  ,Center seat too narrow and please fix the seatbelt buckle configuration so that a carseat can sit in the center and you can still access both seatbelt buckles for the adjacent seats.  
5,Finally! No More Minivan!,Brent ,07/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"OK. Here we go. How do we make the case to not lease our fourth minivan in over ten years? Currently three children 10, 7 and 5. Get the whole family in the van and go visit the Q7. You won't regret it I promise. I know we need all that space and cupholders, but still just go check it out...you deserve it! Maybe, just maybe, the kids can sacrifice a little for mom and dad. Afterall, this vehicle has everything you need to survive as a family of five and it performs, looks and rides like no minivan I've ever owned in the the last ten years. I drive a BMW 5 series so this is for my wife. But, this vehicle alone has made me consider an Audi for myself.","I have to say the back up camera, panorama sunroof, mmi system, third row seat comfort and those 20"" wheels with all season tires for all year beauty.","Once you do as much research as I have to find a minivan replacement, the joy I feel owning the Q7 can't be improved upon."

4.75,SUVs aren't dead,Left Main  ,06/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Purchased this vehicle for my wife because of increased need for space but without the minivan appearance. It has been a pleasure to drive with good handling (minimal body roll) and reasonable acceleration for the class of car. (I drive an RS4 and still enjoy the Q7). The ride can be rough, however, especially at lower speeds -- some likely related to 20"" wheels that were a part of the s-line package. Wish the air suspension was an option on the 3.6 which would likely improve ride quality. Gas mileage is reasonable with the 3.6 (21mpg at 70 mph) given size/wt of vehicle. I'm willing to take 5-7 mpg hit over a minivan for the sportier ride and appearance.","Nice exterior appearance with s-line (especially 20"" five spoke wheels which a very easy to clean).

But with kids and lots of carpooling, a car was out of the question.  I really needed 3rd row seating. My quest was to find an SUV that handled like a car. After lots of test drives, nothing compared to driving the Audi Q7. It was actually fun to drive!  The all wheel drive makes turning ratios a breeze.  I bought the 4.2 L  and wow can it go! I love the MMI (takes a few hours to get used to but it is a great system). Seats are very comfortable, 2nd row seat huge, 3rd row I can sit in comfortably (I'm 5'6"").

Being a technophile, this vehicle leaves you asking for no more. The iPod/iPhone interface is seamless, the navigation is easy to use and the overall MMI provides you with any information you could ask for. I selected the adaptive air suspension option, and that has turned out to be a great option, giving the car an adjustable ride, depending on the conditions.

The brakes aren't as sensitive as the 07's. The 20 inch wheels are also standard. The ride with these at lower speeds is a little noisy but over 45 it's smooth sailing.
