5,This vehicle saved my family's life!,Lowe ,01/15/2016,5,,,,,5,5,5,5,,,"We were driving home from a ski vacation in Whistler, BC when a group of young snowboarders going too fast, lost control of their truck and crossed the center line, hitting us head on at over 50 miles per hour. We rolled and all 6 airbags deployed. It was a 2008 Sequoia... And it saved our lives! Yes, we already thought it was the best vehicle we had ever owned because it was comfortable, powerful, looked great and we could even fit a twin matters in the back for road trips. It wasn't a until I pulled my precious children from this crushed vehicle that I thanked God that I made the choice to buy it. I've since been told there are no know fatalities in the Sequoia.. I don't know if that's a fact or not... But I know for sure that we are not fatalities because of our Sequoia. Honestly, I didn't know it had a built-in roll bar or 6 airbags or such a good safety rating before this crash. I just knew it was comfortable, could tow the boat and fit the kids and all their friends. Now I know... And want everyone else to know too. Just thought I would share this if your are considering buying a Sequoia.",,
5,Second Sequoia,Steve ,01/06/2016,4,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"Great vehicle. This is second one for us. We buy them with 60-70k miles. As long as they are local trade ins with clean car fax and documented service history I have no qualms about driving them to 200k miles and expect few repairs.  Fuel economy is only downside,",,
4.75,"Loving the Sequoia's power, comfort and reliability",sjhanks ,12/05/2014,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Need a big SUV to haul people, gear or tow.  It's the best.

Had a Yukon XL and it was plagued with problems.  Didn't tow really well either.

So we purchased the Toyota and spent a little more on it than other similar SUV's, it's my third Toyota and I think a few extra bucks is worth it.  I do miss the Yukon XL's rear storage.  But we just fold one side of the third row down and we have lots of storage.  I also have 3 kids almost 6 foot or over 6 foot and they can fit really comfortably in the 3rd row because it is so roomy.

Love all the power too, it tows so much better than the 2003 GMC.  Pulls right up the hills with no problems","Comfort for adults in all 3 rows.

Power to tow or cruse.

19 MPG on a 12 hour road trip doing 80-85 MPH is not bad either

Towing is great, no hunting for a gear while climbing grades.

Sound system rocks

Very good turning radius for it's size

Hope it lasts for ever!!!","Wish the rear storage had just about 8 more inches, but don't take it from and of the other seat's leg room."
3.875,Engine failure at 138k miles,tmaracle ,09/18/2014,,,5,5,2,1,,5,5,3,5,"I bought brand new. Always kept up with oil changes.  Mostly highway miles.  A valve spring broke, hit the cylinder head which broke and destroyed the engine block and everything.  For the dealership to build me a new engine is $15k in parts, not including labor. You can't buy new engines like ford and GM.  I bought a used engine for $6k and the labor cost ended up in a bill for $9850.  The new engine is not working properly but the dealership is working with me.  I am disappointed.  I wanted to keep this truck forever.  Now I'm faced with a tough decision.  I also lost 3mpg's.  Now around 13.4 mpg's when I used to average 16.4.  ","Size, comfort and drivability","Sell assembled engines, improved strength of valve springs.  Seal electronics on running boards to prevent corrosion."
4.75,Great & powerful SUV ,fortyniner66 ,02/23/2014,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love this SUV .Have had 3 4runners, Acura mdx among many other vehicles. Last year We sold our dodge mega cab 2500 diesel and bought a crv.Last year we bought a boat and with several vehicles in our family already with kids driving we decided a used Tahoe or Yukon might be a option. We checked out the older sequoias however the power & towing stats on the 08 sequoia were impressive. We found a used sr5 with nearly all the options we wanted and fell in love with the car. Dream to drive..be realistic about the mileage ..it is what you would expect with the size and power..if mileage is your hang up you will want to pass. If you want power,space reliability and pure fun then give it a shot!",,
4.125,Great but a couple problems,tmaracle ,05/16/2011,,,4,5,3,3,,5,5,4,4,"We like this truck. I am encountering some issues.I added the running boards with LED's underneath that light up when the door is opened.The dealership is fixing them for the third time because the wires got corroded at the connection. It is not a water proof connector, bad design. I now also have a leaking oil pan. It appears to be the valve seal that is faulty because the hose and pan are oily.Hopefully the dealership will fix both issues under the extended warranty. So far they told me the light bulbs are not covered. LED's are not light bulbs, they are diodes that rarely fail. This is an electrical issue. Is anyone else having problems. Albeit, these seem to be minor.","This is a great overall vehicle. I like the hands free, the sound quality of the stereo.
It drives great, handles great and is relatively good on gas for its size.
",Better connectors and wiring for LED's on running boards. Better valve seals in the oil pan. Bluetooth needs noise reduction features and maybe a better location of the microphone.
4.25,Good Family Vehicle,mwaltjr17 ,03/01/2011,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,4,3,"Bought this to replace a Buick Enclave.There is a ton of room in second row, and third row (with second row seats moved forward).I love being able to independently move each seat in the second row.It handles much better than other vehicles its size.We are very happy with this purchase.","Interior is terrific.
Lots of storage options and cargo space.
Very capable in bad weather.
Power third row is very nice.","I'd like the ability to add more than one phone to the bluetooth.

4.875,Love our Sequoia! ,Sequoia Rocks ,09/03/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"So, let me start by saying we have a 2004 Toyota 4Runner, with 130,000 miles.  We have NEVER had any issues with it and it drives like the day we drove it off the new car lot.  Since then, we've had 3 girls and grown to a family of 5 and needed something new.  So, we made a mistake.  We bought a Acura MDX.  Sold it.  Bought a Cadillac Escalade.  Sold it.  Finally came back to our first love Toyota and found the Sequoia used with 44k.  In short, this thing is now a member of the family.   Yes, Toyota hit a rough spot, but they are still Toyota.  They will recover and the 2008 Toyota Sequoia has exceeded ALL expectations.  Not enough time to list all the things we love.  Find one used, buy it.","So quiet, so tight, so big, so perfect, love the Sequoia!","Seats could be more comfortable, that is truly my only suggestion.  Get a freakin' pad, this thing is OUTSTANDING! "
4.625,Love our Sequoia,B&C ,08/27/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"We debated on a mini-van, but wanted a larger 4wd. We looked at all the full size SUV's and chose the Sequoia that we purchased through a broker with 15,000 mi. It's an SR5, but loaded with almost every option available. Of course the mileage is horrible, but if you can get past that fact, you will love this SUV. It accelerates as good or better than my Mercedes E320. I have had 5 full size guys with 5 bikes and even my 6'3"" buddy was comfortable in the 3rd row. We are very happy. On road trips we average around 18 mph. We put in an aftermarket DVD - if this is a requirement, get one with the factory DVD, aftermarket will not work with factory BT, poor steering wheel connections, etc. ","Power, large, very comfortable seats, comfortable on the road and very fun to drive.",Nothing that I can think of.
4.5,Good all around value,tommyk ,08/26/2010,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"I forget I am in a large vehicle most of the time.  It has a silky smooth drive train with an amazing amount of power should you need it.  I wish the ride was a bit smoother, but what can one expect from a vehicle with a tow rating of 10,000 lbs?  I get good mileage on the highway, I get about 20 mpg if I keep it at or below 65 mph and around town about 15. I have only had one little problem with it and that was a bad O-ring on the dipstick tube that needed to be replaced.  Other than that it has been a star.",traction and stability control.  I love the sonar system for heads-up control for tight maneuvering.,I wish it had a AWD setting.  
2.375,WORST Toyota,masterdoc ,07/04/2010,,,4,4,1,1,,2,4,1,2,"Now with 34,000 miles, plastic trim falling inside and outside, rubber insulation on tailgate peeled off, engine with wheezing noise in the dash that 3 dealers can't find a solution for it, awful! Dealer interaction - bad - my other cars are 2008 Mercedes CLS, 2010 Audi S5 and 2005 Hummer H2 - by far this is the worst automotive I have owned! Planning to trade it in for either MB GL320TDI or Audi Q7 this fall! Even the recall repair required 2 visits! I guess the golden era for Toyota is over!",DESIGN - best SUV design inside and out!,"BUILD QUALITY, reliability and dealer respect for problems"
3.75,A beast,kbert ,06/10/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,3,3,"I traded in a station wagon to get the Sequoia.  With 3 kids, a spouse, a nanny, and a dog, I figured we really needed something bigger than mid- size/large SUVs like the M-B GL, Toyota Land Cruiser, or Land Rover LR- 3.  After owning it for over a year, I was sort of right-- the Sequoia is a dream for family trips with lots of luggage.  But, we only do those a 2-3 times a year!  The Sequoia is nice for carting kids and sports equipment around, but a smaller SUV could do that too (though with the Seqouia, large/long items like skis and bikes can just be put inside without concern).  In sum, it's just a bit too big for my taste and 99%-of-the-time needs. Family loves it though.",Space for long family trips; rear DVD; adjustable and wide second row; comfortable on highway,"I have almost given up using the nav system -- it's so cumbersome compared to the one in my Audi A6; the dashboard plastic is thin and cheap (glove box is shockingly bad); Toyota should try to make the next one less long and not as tall (reduce size/width of hood, e.g.); engine is too rough/course."
4.875,Interstate Cruiser,navintel ,04/20/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The Sequoia is a great interstate cruiser, comfortable,easy to drive and plenty of power when you need it. Plenty of room for people and cargo and got 21.1 mpg going from Delaware to AZ. I have taken it off-road several times with no problems.",Great engine and the 6-speed trans is excellent for long distance driving.The engine loafs at 75 mph...,"For a vehicle that listed at $39,000,it should have lights on the vanity mirrors."
4.75,Best Large SUV out there.,mg ,04/17/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"If you have a chance to drive this, please do. I found it much more enjoyable and responsive than any of the large SUVs out there. I know Toyota has been hit with reliability issues, but it is Toyota...they will resolve it. I hope to drive this thing to the ground...and should be able too, but right now I only put about 4000 miles a year on this beast.",The bluetooth handsfree phone. The streering wheel also just feels right.,Better visibility for the side view mirrors. I wish they just put the larger Tundra mirrors on it or the Ford crew cab like mirrors. I added 2 small blind sport mirrors to improve the visibility 
4.625,Great for travel and always reliable,AJC ,02/08/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,This is a nice ride even on rough roads.  The 4WD allows  me to get in and out of just about anywhere.  Great for travel and always reliable.  I owned a land rover before this and I only miss the heated front windshield.  This has more plastic than  my 06 which makes the interior look cheep for a SUV of this price.  The seats in my 06 are more comfortable for a small person...especially on the passengers side.,Driving Experience.,Heated front windshield-standard.  Get rid of all the plastic.  The seats are terrible for small people.
4.75,Towed 9000lb boat 4000 miles,culross ,01/28/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Purchased my Sequoia used w/ 7K miles.  Now, at 20K miles, the car still functions like new.  Towed 9000 lb boat/trailer from south California to Alaska without any problems whatsoever.  This SUV was able to accelerate up even the steepest mountain passes with the boat in tow.  Very impressive. Now it allows me to take 6 other people along for fishing trips.  ","Good power, great breaks.  Solid build quality.","Fuel consumption could be a little better, but then we didn't buy it for fuel economy."
5,Big Beast,LGreen ,11/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"First the bad news - -I can't say I ""love"" the Sequoia.  I'd rather be driving a Cayenne or a Land Rover Sport, or a BMW M5.  But, with a big family, pets, nanny, and loads of sporting events and gear, the Sequoia does what it's asked to do, with ease.  The Sequoia really proved itself, in my mind, just a few weeks after we bought it (used, with 20K miles) -- we drove it over 500 miles with kids to South Carolina.  The kids didn't peep or complain once -- not a single time!  They were comfortable, enjoyed the view out, with their own climate control and multiple cup holders, not to mention the excellent rear DVD system.  I've also taken it offroad a few times and it's been fine.",Long distance comfort; rear DVD; fantastic seating flexibility in 2nd and 3rd rows; reliability/confidence in driving a Toyota.,Make the next one a bit smaller -- bigger than the Mercedes GL but smaller than the current Sequoia. Get rid of the chrome grill - -I was able to swap mine for a color-keyed one at the dealer (much better and less intimidating).
4,2008 Sequoia,SRJ ,11/21/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,5,4,3,4,"Lots of power and much more room than the Tahoe. Ride is very good for a ""truck"".  A little too much plastic for a $50K car.","Plenty of power, sliding middle seats and great.  Rear window that goes down.","Tires are shot at 20,000 miles, ""something"" is wrong with the VSC it keeps going off every time I back out of the driveway.  Radio needed to be replaced, 4 wheel drive engagement takes too long."
4.625,Follow up review,Bob ,10/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,4,"After putting on over 20000 miles since purchase, I wanted to state that this vehicle is still enjoyable to operate. The vehicle still ""feels"" new and has not given us any problems. We use it to travel extensively around the country attending basketball tournaments that my granddaughter plays in. Always comfortable for the occupants and plenty of room for the gear.","Comfort, performance, rear seating leg room and storage.","Nav system is difficult and out of date, transmission is a bit ""jerky"", front distance sensors are useless, especially directly in front not at an angle. Heated and cooled cupholders for front seat and rear buckets."
4.625,Awesome SUV,Tommy2tone ,09/23/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Have had my 2008 Platinum 2 years now and I'm truly as happy with it as the day I bought it. Sure, it's pricey (I still can't get over my $850 mo. payment) but there is nothing on the road that even compares with it. If it had a Lexus badge (which it should) no one would even question it. It has plenty of power, an awesome transmission that never misses and is extremely comfortable.I love when my friends who have Lexus, Mercedes and one last week who has a Land Rover, get in and look around then say ""This is nice- what car is this""? The Platinum series is that nice! It's the best overall car I've owned. Oh yeah the Navigation- IT STINKS! drives me crazy! Get a TOMTOM for the dash. ","Powerful motor, Smooth transmission, Platinum series has everything, very comfortable, I'm proud of it.",Navigation- So bad it could cause road rage.

4.875,A Vast Improvement Over Previous Model,rmgator90 ,09/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have had for a couple of months now and it has operated flawlessly. I had an 06 and liked it, but felt it was not as safe as I would like it to be.  This has all the safety whistles that I need, plus it is a MUCH smoother, quiet, and comfortable drive. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy a large SUV.  I have a friend who has an Escalade, and he prefers my Toyota.  Averaging about 18 MPG on mostly highway driving.  ","Smooth drive, second row captains chairs.

4.625,Nice Ride,Charlie ,08/01/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just purchased this vehicle a couple months ago and I'm very happy with it, especially on long trips. I was lucky enough to add leather interior and 20 inch wheels from a Tundra Pickup,  complements of Power Toyota & Arizona Sun tops.  It is very powerful and handles very well for its size, it is very quiet on the highway and the JBL system sounds quite well for a factory system. There is plenty of space for my music equipment and is also relatively easy to park due to its short turning ratio.",Comfortable seats and plenty of leg room. Excellent drive train design with a quality feel.,"Toyota may want to try and position front speakers away from the windshield since this does effect overall sound ability due to sound reflection from the glass.  Better softer materials for the steering wheel could be used other that that hard cheap molded plastic, even my old 2000 Acura has that."

4.75,Nicer than the 1st,9 year owner ,06/09/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought my 2001 Sequoia SR5 when they first came out, put 210,000 miles on it and was sad to trade it in on my new 2008 Limited in May of 2009. With gas prices going up we were actually looking for a smaller SUV but kept saying ""we could get another Sequoia for that price"". We bought our 2008 off the lot for the same price we paid for our 2001 SR5. We have already traveled 600 miles to 2 Lacrosse  tournaments with 3 young men, gear and everyone loves it. We didn't like the new design at first but with the optional 20"" wheels it is really starting to grow on us.

The rattles in the car are very irritating. The bluetooth does NOT work. The person on the other end says that it sounds like you are in a tunnel and cannot hear. Toyota cannot fix the problems! The towing is amazing which is the only reason I am keeping the car. You pay 52000 for a car, you expect a little more - not dust and rattles.",The towing is awesome!

We got the Limited edition and added the dual headrest DVDs with 2nd Row bucket seats.  I could not be more happy with this car. It is primarily my wife's and she goes on and on about how much she loves driving this car.  It has an incredible turning radius for a car of its size and drives very quiet and smooth.

I have had Toyotas in the past and though always scant on creature comforts have been extremely well made and reliable. My last clocked in at 450,000 km and only died due to an accident. Issues IPOD connectivity useless to non existent. Don't bother with the Toyota cable. Navigation package useless. Very error laden, extremely user unfriendly, better to buy an aftermarket system. A 150$ garmin will outperform the Toyota navigation. Gas cap has no lock. Oil changes, uses a cartridge filter that few aftermarket dealers have. Dealers even hate doing changes.","Engine power- power to spare hauling 6000 lbs. Comfort; great seats, views good comfortable ride, plenty of adjustability for trailer towing. Turning radius - beats any other vehicle in its size class. Quiet ride, low noise at highway speed.",By far the worst problem is the navigation/bluetooth system. The maps are years out of date. 2008 DVD with maps from NAVTEQ dated 2003!. Navigation lock out while in motion. You must stop to use it as the voice commands often won't read properly.

I went to a Cherokee sport which was just as bad, then I went to 2009 Toyota matrix, which was beautiful on gas, but I was very unhappy with the limited space. 10 months later I traded in the matrix for the sequoia (best investment I made!).

Before purchasing the 2008 Sequoia, we test drove the Escalade, Tahoe, 2006 Sequoia and Expedition XL for a weekend each, and the 2008 Sequoia was the clear winner.  The Sequoia ride quality and handling ability is excellent... even in 4 wheel drive. Our regular ski trips to Lake Tahoe have been a lot more comfortable and fun, since we got the Sequoia. ","The power from the 5.7L engine. The tight turning ability of the Sequoia. The third row seats is very comfortable for tall guys. Also, if you get the DVD player option, it's installed with a 115V AC outlet with video ports, so you can hookup a game station for the kids to use with the DVD screen.

I chose the Sequoia with very little deliberation. The ride is smooth and the options are top rate. I love the interior space, the only two complaints I have are the lack of chrome accents for a model labeled platinum and the navigation and radio system.  The resolution on the nav system is poor and the text limitation on the radio is just ridiculous for a product from Toyota. I know the profit margins had to be huge, because they did not invest a lot of money to impress customers or be competitive with $150 Nav systems from Best Buy.","Power rear door, ride, interior storage and space.","The Platinum Sequoia lists at $61K+, it needs more high end features to distinguish from other Sequoias such as more wood grained interior features, more exterior chrome accents, and chrome wheels."

Don't let some of the magazine reviews turn you away from buying this gorgeous vehicle. I mean, let's face it, is there a halfway decent car out there that has room for the whole family AND gets good gas mileage. The simple answer is NO.  My 2008 Sequoia is a smooth smooth ride, and mine spends its time on Boston roads, which are some of the worst pothole infested roads in the country.  Some reviews say that the steering is too easy, and coming from a 4runner I can see what they are saying, but if the Sequoia had a Lexus badge they would be complementing its effortless steering instead of trying do equate it to a Chevy Silverado.","I got the SR5 but I got it fully loaded. I love the driver's seat, especially the power ergonomic leg support. The telescopic steering is wonderful, and of course the 3rd row power seats. It's incredible how the rows fold flat to have a pickup truck on-demand. The 381hp 5.7L and 6spd auto are great!","The Bluetooth needs slight improvement: Basically a more powerful DSP mic and a better menu for switching phones between myself and the spouse.

I am very pleased with the Limited 4X2. The ride is what I expected, but even better. I love the turning radius, when once was disappointed with the Tundra radius. The Sequoia is very sleek in it's interior design. It is very spacious and love the tri-climate control. Gas mileage is about 16-18 hwy. The body is huge and the front end takes some getting use to when it comes to parking. I am very happy I went with an SUV, as a long time truck person, I am pleased.

I've already filled it with stuff twice and am amazed at how much fits with rearview mirror still usable.  Interior reconfiguration is so simple and easy.  400 lb-ft of torque is always evident and handling is surprisingly good in the sport mode.  In soft mode, 85 on a smooth interstate feels like 70.  The seating position and front visibility are great, but there are blind spots behind the large front pillars.  You get the same huge center console as the Tundra, designed for people using their truck as an office. ","This 5,700 monster has a turn radius like a Honda Civic.

The 6-speed automatic engine was far better than our previous 4-speed domestic luxury SUV.  It handled very well in all conditions.  The interior of the car has more ""plastic"" than I normally like.  Needs a little more wood trim and some plastic mouldings are loose.   Navigation system was excellent.  The ride with the air suspension was very comfortable and the steering wheel was steady over all the bumps.",Navigation system is outstanding along with the integrated bluetooth phone.,Platinum only comes with 2nd row captain's chairs.

After four LENGTHY visits to the dealership who found mildew on the filter, multiple calls to Toyota (we purchased the extended warranty), we are extremely dissatisfied with the ""customer service.""   There is a constant clicking noise under the cage, the hatch does not close all the way, and the dealer could not solve any of the problems. The navigational system cuts off when driving so passengers cannot enter the info.  Our TomTom is more well designed. ","Fun to drive; comfortable seats, good lumbar support, easy to park, great pick-up, lousy gas mileage (worse than Suburban).  Not as luxurious as the Infiniti or Lexus, but more so than the Honda Pilot & Suburban,",Revamp the navigational system so that at least a passenger can operate it.  Offer a softer shade of white or prettier colors.  Research the dealership if you decide to purchase this vehicle and do not purchase the extended warranty.

But there is a glaring flaw that might get me to return it when the lease is over:  Cargo space.  You buy a big vehicle like this if you have a big family, so the third row is always in use. Cargo space is minuscule behind that row, barely a foot of floor, with the seatback angling back, taking away space as you move up.  If the vehicle were 18 inches longer, all of it in the trunk, it would be perfect for its mission.

When it became time to ""put down"" my Chevy Suburban I began diligent research to find it's replacement. Without question this is the best large SUV all around for the money.  Go ahead and shop Chevy, Ford, Caddy, GMC, M.Benz and most importantly DRIVE THEM.  Toyota has them all beat in quality and reliability and performance.  While M.Benz has an edge on interior luxury, it lacks in ALL other categories when compared. Sequoia is unbeatable as a family vehicle, especially if you plan to take long trips or tow a boat or camper.  What it lacks in the ""bling"" factor it more than makes up for in the ""cha-ching"" factor--financially it makes good sense.","Third row seats (big enough for adults) recline and fold flat with the touch of a button.  Extremely roomy interior, easy access to third row, power rear hatch, tons of storage space, comfortable seating, a rear window that actually goes down, back up camera and adjustable shocks for ""sport""/comfort""",Nav system is overly complicated.

4.625,Excellent Choice,Schnauzer ,12/02/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"With a need to haul people and tow a boat, big SUVs are my family's only option.  I have spent a lot of time in all the competing big SUVs.  With the changes brought to the Sequoia in 2008, I now feel it is the best vehicle in its class. Love the fold flat third row, and the ride and handling are as close to 'sportscar' as you can get in a big vehicle like this. The 'wish list' includes some gps/computer oddities but the engine/ride/handling/utility are unrivaled.  The bluetooth/audio/temp controls on the steering wheel are excellent and totally negate the need to reach for the main controls strewn across the dash. Some gps/phone features are unavailable while driving in the name of safety","All the most important categories are strengths for this SUV:  Utility, ride, handling, towing, engine.  Second to none. The tight turning circle makes this big SUV easy to park. The fold flat third row is a must for anyone who actually plans to put people back there. Excellent driving experience.","All my suggestions are ""gadget"" related. The GPS is much more expensive than an after-market gps but less intuitive to learn and worse yet: does an inferior job of navigating to destinations. Simply wont navigate on some secondary roads.

4.875,Towing,elknutz ,11/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We all know how the Sequoia drives under normal conditions, but hook up a travel trailer and enjoy it even more.  Our fully loaded Limited includes the air bag suspension which keeps the vehicle level without having to transfer additional weight to the front end.   After a weekend outing to the Oregon Coast I was very impressed with the power this rig has. The combo with our 29' Tango was no match for climbing or descending the Oregon Coast Range. The transmission shifted with ease while in the tow mode and is simply a workhorse.  The Sequoia handled better than any other truck / trailer combo I have driven  over the last 15 years.

4.75,Excellent Car for a Large Family,Derek ,11/22/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We just purchased our Sequoia two weeks ago and love it. We shopped around and took a look at the Tahoe and Escalade to compare it to. The Escalade was about $25k more and a lot worse on the mpg. Workmanship of the Tahoe had a poor feel and look to it, not to mention poor resale value. We had a 2004 Toyota 4 Runner and loved it, but were running out of space and decided to move up to the big boy. We can actually fit 3 more adults into the Sequoia over the 4 Runner comfortably. We opted for the SR5 4 X 4 with most of the options that come on the Limited edition, but without the additional $$$. We actually paid a little less for the Sequoia then we did for the 4 Runner almost 5 years ago.","The leather seats are plush and rear view camera is great. The second and third row seats have plenty of space for adults. The ride and gear shift with the 5.7 liter engine and six speed transmission is smooth. It's not a boat on the road and the steering, handling, and braking are very responsive. ","Control panel should be angled more toward the driver to help those with a shorter reach, like my wife, get to the radio and other controls.

Things we love: interior roominess- we can fit two carseats, and a full sized adult in the second and third rows.  This never happened in our old suv.  All three rows recline.  In the second row, each seat moves individually.  So if the middle person wants to recline, they can do so without bothering the other two riders.

Think disabled, we rarely do, until we ourselves are in that situation. ",Reliability,"Second row seats should have a power option, like the third row."

While most people are aware of what they're buying and all of the features that go with the vehicle, at the time of purchase, some ""necessities"" become apparent after your ownership experience gains tenure.    ",Reliability.,"All control buttons should be backlit, not just a few. Nose mask (Toyota doesn't make one). Cigarette lighter for rear passenger seat area. Improved lumbar (lower back) and leg support - the seats need adjustable leg support to permit greater support of the legs, behind the knees. Split tailgate."

Looked at all the competition and frankly they were no match for the Sequoia, in my opinion. The interior design and comfort is far superior to all the others especially in the rear seating area. The buckets in the second row are fully adjustable and also recline which made it great for the rear passengers. Not difficult to handle around town and it's performance is well, outstanding. Recent long trip,passengers were very comfortable. Gas mileage low, but not why most will buy this vehicle.

Hard to know when you are really close to something directly in front. Be able to change destination while in motion as long as passenger seat is occupied.

After researching the Armada, Yukon, Escalade I decided to get a new Sequoia for style, reliability, and resale value.  After owning the car for a few weeks, I am so happy with my decision.  The Sequoia has so many smart options on the inside, if you have a family you really can't beat the user experience of this SUV.","The navigation system is light years smarter than a Garmin (which is extremely reliable though) and the entire driver/passenger experience is enjoyable.

Supple smooth and quiet ride with lots of power.  Although the Toyota doesn't have bling factor, it is true luxo where it counts - ride, handling smoothness and over all great use of interior space. Very comfortable 2nd and 3rd rows and easy to get into 3rd row. Overall our family is very happy with our choice of this comfortable fun and functional SUV.","Great power and handling, love the cooled seats and 2nd row captain. Fold flat 3rd row very good and easy. Auto hatch. Love the big rims.

We have driven through the Appalachian mountains twice and it rides wonderfully.  With three growing children and a lot of long trips planned we wanted something bigger than the Sienna for these trips.  Over a 6-month period I evaluated the Navigator and Armada and had to go with the Sequoia due to my personal experience with Toyota quality the past 16 years.  We look forward to getting at least ten years out of this vehicle.","We like the size, power-folding 3rd row, stereo w/mp3, three-zone climate control, large size of seats, adjustable seats, and comfort.",Amount of cargo space behind 3rd row too small (even another 6 inches would make a huge difference).  In ten years many of the plastic parts will be broken (my Camry experience) from normal use.  I do not understand why gas cap door does not lock.

""Sweet spot"" on the highway is about 68 for my Sequoia.  Put the cruise on around there, and I consistently get 22-23 MPG, which is great to me.  My SR5 came with a leather upgrade, and the quality is very high.  Very happy so far with my purchase",Fold flat 2nd and 3rd row seats.  You can really haul a big load.  I like the sleek instrumentation on the interior and all the storage compartments.,"Obviously, would be better if it got 30 MPG, but just know what you're getting into before you buy.  One complaint might be that upgrading packages from SR5 to Limited often crossed a price breaking point.  More cost efficient to get SR5 with upgrades.

Test drove any out there, Escalate, Yukon, Tahoe, Expedition, Aspen, QX56, Navigator. When you compare each of those cars to the Toyota, probably each will have a thing or two better than the Toyota BUT as a package... nothing is comparable. The ride is very close to the Navigator, the performance... well there is nothing to compare too! The interior is extremely roomy and especially the 2nd and 3rd row (both fold flat and recline).

I made record time, and got a reasonable 17 MPG.  I could see easily getting 19 keeping it at 70-75.  The interior is huge.  I had plenty of luggage room even with the kids' seats in the second row.

We had an 03 Expedition that was acting up.  Figure we'd give Toyota a try since big Ford has let us down on what was suppose to be our 10 year SUV.  For being a full size SUV, this machine drives like a car.  Suspension is much nicer and acceleration is super smooth.  I never thought I'd ever switch to a Japanese SUV for fear that it's not roomy enough for my family but I'm sure glad now.  Definitely made the right decision.  The design is well thought out for families that need to drive 3 kids in car seats.

They also dropped the gas tank cover lock from the old Sequoia... why???  And they dropped the side moulding strips to protect vs door dings. And the gas mileage is much less than my old Sequoia, and much less than advertised. It is a great truck and very comfortable but I might think twice about keeping my old Sequoia. Don't get caught up in the hype!!","Engine power. Exterior ""look"".  Upgraded gadgets incl bluetooth, power fold flat 3rd row seats. Nav Is OK but not as intuitive as a Garmin.","More headroom; seats have plenty of room to drop. Add side body moulding strips for protection in the parking lot.

The Sequoia is a pleasure to drive and has many nice standard features. Interior space is excellent. Not thrilled with the regional packaging of the options. Each dealer in our region had similarly equipped vehicles (cold weather pkg, sunroof, etc.). It seems to be the trend with Toyota.

With the high gas prices, you can really swing a sweet deal on an SUV, even one of these.  Sure a minivan beats it in outright interior space and gets better MPG, but there's no substitute for true V8 power, torque and brawn when you really need it.  Very smooth and quiet with more than enough power to handle just about any situation.  Right now these seem pretty exclusive - you won't see yourself coming and going like you would in a Suburban.","The 5.7 iForce V8 is a true gem. Toyota really outdid themselves on this one and it totally smokes the competition. Test reports say it'll do 0-60 in the 6s and 1/4 in the high 14s - not too shabby for a 3-ton SUV, and I believe it.  This thing flat out hauls.  MPG isn't bad, all things considered.","Parts of the dash and door panels are a bit on the cheap side - wouldn't expect these demerits on a Toyota.  Can get awfully expensive quickly when you start adding options - the DVD option, for example, is about $1700 where it's only about $1200 on a GM or Ford SUV."

I used to be a GM truck guy, but had so many reliability and customer service problems that I finally conducted a fair assessment of the large SUVs available and the Sequoia came out on top.  It handles great (not like the 5,900 pound SUV that it is), looks great, and the time is right to buy.",The 5.7L V8 is well designed with lots of power on tap.  The overall interior are spacious.  The back up camera keeps you in check.,"Fuel economy, although it is not bad.  Maybe an active fuel management system to shut down cylinders.

Especially around town.  But I wouldn't have bought it if I did.  I only get about 9-10 MPG.  I have never been in such a big vehicle that makes u-turns better then most cars I have owned.

The turning radius is the smallest of all.  The safety features and navigation system only add to the value one gets with this vehicle.  The technology is mind boggling.  The blue tooth cell phone aspect allows the driver to answer thier phone on the steering wheel with out ever having to reach for the cell phone.  Caller ID shows up on the nav system screen.  The rear camera allows the driver to see whats there and the sensors keep you from running into things.

I'd purchased the 2001 when they first came out and after 7 years had absolutely no major problems with the car so I decided to stick with the new 2008 model.  I've had it a few days and love it.  Although I must admit it feels fairly larger to drive, kinda like you're in tank or a cockpit, but you get used to it quickly.  Price is much higher than before but guess you gotta pay for more automation, i.e., nav, theatre system, power hatch and seats.  ",My favorite features would be the automation.  The 2001 didn't have the power hatch or power folding seats (it's a must with kids).  I also like the captains chairs with the walk through to the third row.  The look of the dash and steering wheel w/Bluetooth is great also.,"The speedometer is so deeply inset that the passenger cannot see it. Also, memory seating would have been nice"
4.5,Fine For Me,Silver Man ,02/14/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,3,5,Seeing that this is my first SUV purchase it was well worth it! I test drove the Tahoe. I wasnt feeling it at all. The Expedition just didnt look appealing to me either. Once I saw the Sequioa. I fell in love with it. Once I drove it I knew this was the truck for me. My wife who drives a Honda Accord even likes the way it handles. Im 6`4 so its just fine with me!!! Thank you Toyota for getting it right!!,The interior room.,I wish the navigation was more user friendly.
4.875,2008 Toyota Sequoia,Toyota 4everVB ,02/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,We have been driving Toyotas since 1990.  They are the most dependable vehicles in this planet!  We still drive our 1998 4 runner and have never had any problems!  We traded in our 2006 Tacoma for the 2008 Sequoia because it rides like a luxury car.  We feel safe in it will all the airbags!  This is the way to go! I love what Toyota does for me and my family!,"Space, space, space, comfort, safety.",Room to store my purse!  
4.625,New Platinum Silver luxo rocket!,John ,02/10/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Love it! Wow, my wife and I purchased this after our 04 Armada, which had its share of problems but was overall a real nice vehicle for us for the last several years. The new Sequoia seems larger inside, yet fits inside the garage just a bit better, maybe because of rounded corners. The outside style takes some getting used to regarding the hood and front bumper. Without the front sensors, I wouldn't have a clue where the corners are. Between the beeping sensors and great quality rear backup camera, I haven't hit anything yet.","Power, smoothness of ride, quality materials although not very ""fancy"". Will probably be a lot of wood kits sold. Sensors, camera, gadgets, navigation, power folding mirrors, & toys.","Could dress up the dash a bit more. No rain sensing windshield wipers, I actually have to flip a lever!"
4.875,2008 Sequoia,snugabug ,02/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We absolutely love our new Sequoia!  We had a 2005 4Runner that was fine, but we now have 2 1/2 year old twins along with a 65 pound lab and definitely wanted more space everywhere within a new vehicle. My husband and I are truly die-hard Toyota fans, and were waiting for the new Sequoias to arrive. We are extremely pleased with the way it rides, the comfort of all the seats and were really impressed with how easy it was to actually drive.  We both thought it may, for the lack of a better description, ""float"" as you drove it.  However, it is very easy and fun to drive.  It provides tons of space and just enough gadgets to keep everyone happy.           ",,
4.625,"Had a 2001 Sequoia SR5, time to upgrade",jd08limited ,01/29/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Had a 01 Sequoia SR5 and loved it, but wanted to upgrade to the limited. Drove an 07 and then the 08 and that was it, we were sold.  The power difference, ride control, steering feel, and did I say power difference was night and day. Once we saw the fold flat 2nd & 3rd row seats, we knew we had to get it as we hated to have to always take out and put back the 3rd row seats from our first Sequoia. ",Engine power.  3rd row seats. Build quality. Exterior look.  Fog lights. Heated seats. Big sideview mirrors. Aux. hookup for our Ipod.,"Well, we did not expect to get good gas mileage, but of course that would be a nice improvement.  Ability to open the rear side windows would be cool-my friend Expedition has that and it is a nice plus. We have only had it 4 days and love it, so no real complaints at this point. "
4.75,Nice Upgrade,Bob ,01/23/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Traded in a 2005 Sequoia for a this.  Bigger seats, wider vehicle and improved gas mileage with the 5.7.  Drives great, lots of toys, liked the 2005, but this is definately an upgrade.  ","Fully loaded, so enjoying the toys.  Will find out on my first ""drive"" in a week of 750 miles.  ","There is one main change, bring back the fender flares.  The old body style was ""prettier"", so bring some of the character back.  "
4.375,New owner,Bob ,01/22/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,3,4,"I traded my 2004 Sequoia in for this 2008 Limited 4WD and so far really like the 2008. In town and interstate driving I average 15mpg. I love the six speed on the console and down shift alot to save brakes and it is very simple to do. The 381HP is smooth and more than enough power.  The transmission is very smooth shifting.  I liked my 2004 so much I was a little hesitant to trade, but I wouldn't go back now that I have had this 2008 for three weeks. Room out the kazoo. The turning radius is great, three foot less than my 2004.","The navigation system is great, pretty easy to use also.  Blue tooth is nice. The ride is quiet. I'm amazed how much I use the electric rear hatch as opposed to manual useage.","I wish they still had the fold and tumble seats for storage purposes, but I guess no vehicle is perfect."
4.875,Best SUV on the road,David ,01/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is the best full size suv on the market today. Buy the 5.7 380 plus HP engine for the incredible acceleration and the better gas mileage than the 4.7 litre. The interior in the limited is awesome, with illuminated dash similar to Lexus and hands free bluetooth phone system. The truck rides like a Bentley for 1/4 the cost.","Great turning radius, very quiet at highway cruising speeds, excellent acceleration. ",The only improvement I would suggest is memory for front seats on the limited edition. For $45K you should get memory seats!
4.5,Was looking for a SUV that tows,Robert ,01/09/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,4,"Needed something larger and wanted to be able to tow about 7000 lbs. This looked to be the right mix, but we had concern over first year and whether it was all it appeared on paper. Was looking at either an Expedition, Armada, or the new Sequoia. The Seq rear axle is all new and very capable but new design for Toy and a little concerning, so I hope for the best there. But we think we made the right choice. Power is very smooth and ample for this huge SUV. It is wider then a Suburban. Drives sturdy and handles very well. Brakes stop very well. Very quiet engine compared to the other SUVs in class.","Exterior style, mostly front end. Climate controls are very nice and vents are Everywhere in the front, 2nd and 3rd row cabin! Quietness. Storage is overly abundant in closable areas everywhere. 12volt outlet in the center console is nice for charging out of sight. Headlights are very illuminating.","E-brake is hard to find with the foot.  Lights needed on more interior controls, impossible to see about 30% of the dash mounted controls in the dark. Aux audio port could be moved to the center console. Tow package avail without 7 other options would be nice. Rear side window could be operable."
4.875,Sequoia Platinum First Impression: WOW!,J. Goldsmith ,01/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've owned this vehicle for less than 24 hours and I have only driven it home from the dealership but that's 50+ miles of everything from Interstate to rough dirt roads, and winding, washboard mountain byways in between.  On and off pavement, dirt, snow and ice, I have never become so comfortable, so ""at home"", felt so secure and in command so quickly in my almost 50 years behind one wheel or another.  Also, I have never been in a car/truck that was so thoughtfully designed with the American motorist/family in mind.  ""Fuel Economy"" and reliability just guesses at this stage,  With apologies to ""Field of Dreams and Iowa:  ""Is this heaven?  No.  This is a 4WD Platinum Sequoia.""    ",Driver's seat.  The most adjustable and comfortable I've ever been in.,All the tech gadgets can always be made more intuitive and user friendly... otherwise: None.
4.75,I love my new Sequoia!!,lovemysequoia ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,This SUV is so easy to drive.  The ride is nice and the interior is very comfortable.,My favorite features include the automatic folding rear seat and the automatic rear door.,My only complaints would be there is not a lot of cargo room if you are using the 3rd row seat all of the time.  The gas mileage is also poor.  I'm only getting about 13 miles to the gallon.
5,Awesome,dags2517 ,12/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Just purchased this vehicle.  All I can say is awesome! This SUV is perfect for a large family.  We can fit three car seats in the middle bench seat(which is the main reason for purchase).  Fit double stroller in back and plenty of room for anything extra. Drive is smooth and seats are comfortable.  DVD system is great for the kids.  Dashboard setup is awesome and very stylish.  Finally the Sequoia has fold down third row.  This vehicle as something for everyone.    ,"Fold down third row, comfortable seats, dual air control and rear air control, smooth ride and quite engine.",Nothing.
4.75,Excellent Updates,Eudais ,12/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"My new Sequoia 08 Limited drives just fabulously!  I love the torque that this baby provides when I step on the gas.  Overall the vehicle is youthful, rugged, and yet still refined.  I did get the 20"" wheels, and overall they ride extremely nice, and look awesome.  The vehicle interior is extremely quiet compared to my 2004 Yukon Denali XL.  The backup camera performs admirably, and is a must with 3 little kids!  The integrated bluetooth feature is a must if you are on your phone a lot, it is just fabulous.  I do like the look and feel of this new body style.  I purchased the Pyrite Mica color, and think is looks fabulous.  (looks better in person than online)  My kids love the 3rd row seat!","Number one feature has to be the look.  I think they just look awesome.  After that, I would say the engine is a huge plus and performs great.  I love the integrated bluetooth, Navi system, and backup camera.  I also purchased an extra set of floor mats for winter use.  (rubberized) 3rd row seat!","I don't like all of the different option packages that Toyota puts in this vehicle.  I have no electronic rear lift gate.  It should be standard on all Limiteds.  You also would think that for this price premium, load leveling would be a standard feature on the Limiteds as well.  Overall I love it!"
5,Great SUV,ck_b2001 ,12/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great SUV, Lots of power. Acceptable fuel economy. Lots of space. Handles like car. Great engine and transmission. Lots of std features. Build quality looks solid.","Short turn radius, acceleration, interior space.",Steering wheel mounted controls should be std.
