5,Not My First Choice But the Better Choice!,B Hudson ,07/09/2016,4,,4,,,5,4,4,5,,,"In March 2016, I purchased a damn 2008 Scion tC w/5 speed manual transmission. I do not think highly of the dealership I purchased it from but the car has been a great decision so far. I was not comfortable making yet another purchase on a car over 100k miles. The vehicle had 122k when I purchased it and now it is at 128k. I am surprised the car is in almost flawless condition. The body is in mostly good shape. I can tell the previous owner was not the best driver based on a few dings around the body. The rear bumper clear coat is completely gone. I am estimating that I will have to repaint the rear bumper. The car has been in Florida its entire life and I can tell the vehicle has never been waxed...ever. Dangerous never to wax here. I know Toyota and Honda have questionable paint qualities but waxing it once in a while will help! Since I have owned the vehicle I have flushed the radiator, changed the thermostat (no leaking, no overheating), two oil changes, new tires, new brakes and rotors, throttle cleaning. I plan on replacing the spark plugs soon. The only major mechanical issue with the car occurred a few weeks ago after I performed my brake change. The vehicle lost all oil. After running a check, the oil valve cover casket went out. It does not appear to be a common problem based on what I am told but it does happen. I am estimating I does am right at 30 miles per gallon on fuel, higher than EPA Estimates. I am not thrilled with the acceleration of the vehicle but it gets the job done. The manual transmission is easy to operate, mostly smooth shifting. Because of the electronic throttles they use in cars now, there is a slight lag on second gear, be prepared for it if you leave the car off for hours and start driving. The sound system is great, I wish the car had Satillite Radio which may end up installing myself. Except for the basic maintenance I just mentioned, the vehicle has required little maintenance! I would recommend using HID headlights instead of the factory headlights. The factory lights have a limited range. Expect to fill up with $30. Do not expect a racing machine from the tC but it is a fun car to drive, comfortable, not cramped for a two door. I would never bother driving the 4 speed automatic version of this car as it would be boring and full of problems. Stick with the manual, be gentle on it and it will be reliable for a long time.",,
4.5,Well-balanced car for the price,sushi714 ,09/06/2014,,,5,4,4,5,,4,5,5,4,"I purchased my 2008 Scion tC brand new in December of 2007 and still feel pretty satisfied with it!  I'm not sure if there was a better deal out there when I purchased this vehicle, but it provided the best balance between price, style, performance, and reliability (knowing that it came from the Toyota family of brands). Still in great condition, so haven't had to do anything except the usual maintenence as suggested by Scion.  Prefer ANT10 series (2009 and previous years) due to change to a more ""boring"" interior with the AGT20 (2010 - current) series.","STANDARD panoramic moonroof, Pioneer sound system (w/ subwoofer), 17"" wheels, and keyless entry!  Yes, all of that is STANDARD EQUIPMENT (well, on the Base model, anyway)!!!","The trunk latch definitely needed a redesign, but I haven't seen many reports of any of the AGT20 series (2010 to current) having this issue.  Better paint or at least a few more coats of paint would definitely be great, as I swear there's only 1 layer of paint on the car."
4,Great value for your money - looking for a first car?,iron112 ,08/12/2013,,,4,4,3,4,,3,4,5,5,"The TC was my first car. The TC offers outstanding value for the price.You'd end up paying 3-4k more in other cars for the same features that are present in the TC - all with Toyota reliability. This car is more about a balance of features rather than pure muscle. Despite it's modest engine, it handles well.As a bonus, the TC was made for modders. If you're a modding junkie, and have the money, the TC is your car. Drawbacks - its underpowered - it has a Camry engine. It's peppy in the lower RPM's, but doesnt have true muscle. Its rear door is a pain. The gas mileage is somewhat lacking for a 4 cylinder.But if you can look past these negatives, then the TC is for you. ","The TC comes with a whole host of features, usually not present in entry level cars of this tier. 

The panoramic sunroof is great. It's especially fantastic opened in the spring and summer. 

The TC has stronger acceleration in the lower RPM's - it's somewhat deceptive, it gives the feeling of a sports car at times, even though its not. (A plus!)

The stock Pioneer audio system is excellent. I'm sure some people will always want to mod this, but it's great in my opinion and doesn't need to be touched. Set your SSP to ""Feel"" and the audio system shows its true power.

The audio controls on the wheel is a nice touch. The wheel's leather wrapping is also very nice, and adds grip.
","Taking a look at the current Scion's lineup, the TC may not be the bargain it once was. For models before 2012-2011, the TC debuted at a very affordable 16k. At this price, you're talking a real bargain - and this was the TC's greatest strength. It was a perfect first car for young adults. 

Now, there is no real incentive to buy a TC. It's price-point is too high - it went up a whopping 4k, and with the FRS, why spend your money on a TC when you could get a real sports car for 5k more? 

The TC was fine the way it was.
Scion needs to bring the price back down again. the TC was ultimately about awesome value - people could mod on additions later. "

At 4700 miles I noticed the oil light came on. Checked the oil, found it wasn't even touching the stick, but it was time for my warranty oil change and took it in. Told them what was going on. I was told to drive it for half of the normal oil change period and bring it back. It ran out before that time. I took it in, they kept it for about 3 weeks. Said it was the valve stem seals and replaced them.

Excellent performance for a 4 cylinder engine. The car actually has some torque so its not necessary to downshift every time you come across a hill.  The transmission is a little clunky, and it would be nice to have a 6th gear for extended periods on the highway, but its not enough to take away from the car. Stock tires were junk, but still had a little tread left @ 35k.  Good sound system for a factory stereo, and its nice that its ipod compatible.

The look is stylish but the paint seemed to fade after a few months! My sharp black turned dull. It had a sparkle to start that not so much anymore.

Vehicle is essentially used by my daughter, who is off to college in January. Only complaints are paint does not resist scratches very well and stock tires are simply crap. I guess this is the real cost of having this vehicle being priced quite low in comparison to other similar vehicles.  I do question why a manufacturer would put tires with a tread wear rating of only 160 on a vehicle, the cost of adding better tires would only increase the cost of the vehicle by a couple of $100! The stock tires were Yokohamas - I made sure the replacement tires were not!",Like the looks of the vehicle and the features.,"Simple - better paint and Toyota and better stock tires.

So when I park head on, the high curb started pulling out the undercover.  Next thing you know, my entire bumper is messed up because its attached to the undercover.  A few months down the road, I had to replace all 4 tires after 35K miles.  So when I finally fixed that, I hit a garbage bin which knock off my passenger side mirror.  Then a couple months, the car wash ""professional"" managed to  break off the rear hatchback garnish/handle when he cleaning the back.

I live in the desert with over 100* on most days in the summer and this vehicle has NO problem driving in hot weather. A very powerful 4-cylinder acts as if it has a 6-cylinder under the hood.

I would not mind having a 6th gear on this manual transmission. And scion, ,please put a short throw shifter in during assembly, ,with a shorter height to shift lever also.

Being a mechanic the tC has been one of the easiest vehicles I have ever worked on and maintained. I have seen countless testimonies of owners getting 100-200K and higher miles on the tC with virtually no issues outside of normal maintenance.

The gears have locked while shifting causing grinding, the car has felt as though it is sliding through corners. I would not recommend this car to anyone!

5,Can't beat that,sportex ,10/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After pitching in a few extra bucks for the TRD parts. I'd say it's worth the extra money to upgrade. Acceleration is proportional to the weight of the car. Enough to get up and go but not so much that you cant control the vehicle. This car looks like a $28k vehicle and gets plenty of looks around town. The sound system is very nice for a factory system. You can't beat the reliability on this vehicle. Having said that, the manual transmission seems to feel like it should have one more gear. The fuel economy seems to suffer when driving in traffic. But overall I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a sports car without the outrageous MSRP and insurance costs.",Factory aftermarket upgrades. Relatively inexpensive replacement parts.

Tho the altima is powerful and has good acceleration, my new scion seems to take off quicker and shifts faster. This is do to the lighter weight car and a 2.4 L engine. Most cars with 2.4 L like Camry weigh much more. Car accelerates very quick with out much effort on the accelerator. Smooth clutch and shifting feels firm. Gas miles is about right and all depends on the driver more then any factor and tire pressure. Hold good con curbs and has more sportier feels suspension as to a corolla or standard Camry.  Now I really love my car and Toyota makes the most reliable car ","Sunroof, handling, performance, and over all looks. This car is built in Japan unlike Camry or Corolla.

My friends all love it as much as I do.  My old car did get slightly better gas mileage but the tC still does pretty well.  The sun/moon room is awesome as is the reclining back seat and the hatch back feature gives me plenty of room in the trunk.  It does pretty well in the snow.

Cornering is a blast, and getting on the highway isn't really a problem.  I'm 6' 4"", so headroom is a bit tight, but not unbearably so.  The ride quality is good for a sport coupe, and the interior is pretty nice; it's well laid out, with all controls easily reachable, and all the gauges are easily read.

The person that owned the car before must have loved driving it. It came with TRD exhaust and cold air intake. It most certainly changed the feel of the car compared the a stock TC.

Not looking forward to driving it in inclement weather because of the tires, though, but hopefully Toyota/Scion will offer options on future models. But no regrets so far.

I traded in a 2002 Toyota Solara because I wanted better gas mileage and I'd heard that 2008 was the last for the Solara, so it was out. I wanted a coupe, but the Yaris was too small so I looked at the Scion tC.  I was surprised to find there wasn't any haggling about the price - what you see is what you get, but the dealer was very generous on my trade-in. I was amazed at the big interior; even bigger than the Solara. I miss the Solara's leather seats and the cushy interior, but the tC is comfortable and the ride is smooth. And I love the upgraded Pioneer sound system! Wish I'd opted for the navigation system.","The panoramic roof, the hatchback (I've got 3 dogs), the acceleration, the heavy-duty A/C, the 17"" wheels, headlights and taillights, the sound system set on ""Feel,"" the spoiler, the Sizzling Crimson Mica paint job, the lack of chrome, the cruise control, the outside temperature reading, etc.!","Improve gas mileage (20 mi./gal. in town?); the ride is noisy; elec. windows are jerky; offer leather interior, tinted windows, and upgraded A/C controls where you can set the temperature.

The standard tires are a bit below average, (slide during not too aggressive turns). The radio door squeaks (nothing a bit of oil can't fix though). Has projector headlights which is a GREAT plus! The only major problem is the coin/change compartment. DO NOT put pennies or dimes in there! They will fall through the hinge hole and cause the compartment to NOT open up fully anymore!

When you are driving you don't hear the cars when you go past them. It is built on racing suspension and other race car stuff so it drives really smooth and comfortable. The gas mileage on this thing is awesome. My parents surprised me with it one day and I already wanted one so I was very happy. All my friends love it and my younger brothers want it.

4.75,Love this car...with just a few ideas...,Larz Hanson ,03/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"My tC provides more of a ""sport car"" feel than many other ""sporty"" cars competing against it for market share. Cornering is flat and ""planted"", giving a great sense of confidence and solid feel. The suspension is properly firm...the way a good sports car should be...but still offers a nice, smooth ride quality. Acceleration can be very strong if you stomp the gas, but then you pay for it next time at the gas station. That may be the biggest thing I'd change if I could help design the next tC update...I think the transmission should include one more gear - a good overdrive to improve gas mileage. The tC is small, while its engine has plenty of torque. An overdrive might give well over 30mpg.","I love the front ""face"", especially since I bought aftermarket fog lights and grilles that integrate better than factory models. Very pretty car! I really like the panorama roof, hatchback design and the stereo with subwoofer and iPod integration.","An overdrive gear in the transmission. I don't know about the manual, but the automatic runs upwards of 3000rpm on the interstate, about 1000rpm higher than it needs to be considering the tC's small size and powerful engine.

It was a easy decision after comparing the features, quality, performance, and price.  Once you add the features the tC has to a car like a Civic, or Tiberon the tC is a much better value.  One of the nicest things about buying this car is that the Scion dealerships do not add any unnecessary features, you get to choose was added features when you buy the car.

Making this a performance car might not be worth the money, but a few performance tweaks could make an everyday driver happy.  I agree with many others that a rear wiper would definitely come in handy.  A major problem in customization for tires.  2008 tC comes with Z rated tires!  Sounds great if you are taking this thing to the track, but for everyday driving they are completely unnecessary & expensive.  There is no downgrade option for all weather tires - big mistake for car buyers who know what they want.","LED taillight option, fog lights, upgraded sound system, and overall look & performance.  A nice practical option is the floor mats with removable carpeting - it makes clean up easier","Tire options, interior fabric & color options, rear wiper, thinner visors (my garage door opener clip had to be bent to fit around it)"
4.75,"Great buy, fun to drive",Michael ,09/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I've had this car for one week now, and have driven 500 miles. My first impression:  pros: fun to drive, decent stock handling, fairly quick. So many great standard features, things like 2 sunroofs, cruise control, remote unlock. Very impressive stock stereo. Low price tag. Exterior and interior styling. Roomy.  Cons: stock tires don't have amazing performance. That's all I can really think of.  Overall: you can't beat the features for the price. It's a great car, fun to drive, looks amazing, roomy, comfortable, well built. I don't really have anything bad to say besides the fact that it doesn't come with great tires.",Great stereo. Steering wheel stereo controls. Dual sunroof. ,"I added a few of the TRD options, as well as one of the Scion options. TRD quick shifter. TRD front strut bar. TRD rear sway bar. TRD lowering springs. Rear pedestal spoiler. All of those options are great. Handles much better, shifts are easy. I would also recommend new high performance tires."
4.75,"Well built, well equipped",ScionTc59 ,09/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I compared similar models in the tC's price range (Mazda3, Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra) and found this to be the best bang for the buck, very well equipped, and lots of room for modifications. Very smooth and quiet ride, could be a bit roomier as I am tall (6'4"") but I fit ok. Looks great and overall fit and finish are excellent! Would highly recommend!","Dual sunroofs, iPod capability, standard subwoofer, power everything.","Standard swaybars, 6 CD changer, more interior room, power seats, lower it about 1/2"", rear wiper/washer, 6 speed manual option."
4.625,Great Car!!  ,rvart06 ,09/21/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I have owned this car for about a week and a half now and I'm pretty satisfied with it.  I was told by the selling agent at the dealership that the car goes through tires quickly, which is really its only negative aspect.  I was told one set of tires will last about 1 mile/15,000 miles. The car handles decently, with satisfying acceleration.  The braking is a tad on the weaker side, probably because the car is 3000 lbs.  Also, when taking a sharp turn at higher speeds (around a corner for example) there is considerable body roll.  But other than these minor things, the car is great!!  Great features for the price, fun to drive, great body styling!",My favorite features were the low-profile tires on the 17 inch alloy rims.  I also really like the mini subwoofer that is factory installed in the trunk. ,"Really, the only thing this car could use is tighter springs/struts.  (perhaps a TRD performance set?) It wouldn't be hard for the buyer to replace on their own.  Also, when in the driver seat, you cannot see the front of the car so at first its a little hard to maneuver the car."
4.625,Good car,Tyler ,09/20/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"Overall, very good quality for the money. I average 26-29 mpg mixed highway and city driving; if you drive the car like a maniac, your fuel efficiency won't be as good. Interior looks nice, but can tell it's where Toyota performed it's cost-cutting. Sound system is awesome, iPod connectivity is cool (and yes, it does come standard with the port to connect it, contrary to what other people have said). Few rattles here and there, but relatively smooth ride. Could use more HP, but power is very good for 4 cylinder. Head room will definitely be a problem for taller drivers though, but lots of leg room available in back seat. Exterior looks awesome, especially with pedestal spoiler.","Optional pedestal spoiler, sound system.","Optional fog lights won't light up unless headlights are on also, less plastic in interior, more head room, more standard HP."
5,Affordable and Fun to Drive ,Mike Nemo ,09/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is definitely more fun to drive than a Mazda3, Mitsubishi Lancer or Eclipse. It handles great on the highway and on back roads. Brakes are excellent.  It really turns people's heads when you pass. It is affordable and with so many factory accessories very easy to customize from the initial purchase.","Acceleration, handling and brakes.",Rear windshield wiper. Better interior plastics.
4.875,It's worth the money you pay,DsTC ,09/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I would recommend this car - for the money that you pay it's the best. It's not something I would try to make fast, it's a four cylinder. It's reliable and has just enough HP to get it done.","I like the upgraded sound system and the moon roof, the reliability is top notch.",The interior material needs to be upgraded it looks and feels cheap.
4.625,Scion's best selling car!,revinnova ,08/18/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,4,5,"The new Scion tC is awesome! It seems to be very similar to the previous models with the exception of the taillights, headlights, two more standard side curtain airbags, and iPod connectivity. The Scion tC is really fun to drive. I think it's cool that it comes with so many standard features, such as alloy wheels, sun/moonroof, side indicators, six airbags, and immobiliser.The steering is nice and solid like a race car, and I love the rear hatch. I can fit a whole of stuff in that the rear. One problem with the tC is that it seems to rattle a little more than normal if I drive over old pavement. Other than that it's an awesome car!","Sun/moonroof, immobiliser, exterior design, the fact that headlights turn off by themselves, the lighting of the speedometer, and the hatch.","I didn't really like the panoramic roof behind the sun/moonroof, it seemed useless and made the tC seems kind of vulnerable. The amount of plastic in the interior, the silver paint in the interior seemed kind of cheap, and the rattling sound I hear when I drive over old roads."
4.375,I love my car!!,junebug ,08/16/2007,,,4,5,3,4,,5,4,5,5,The car is great!  No complaints.  Got the navigation system and the security system and the extras are worth it for me.  The sunroof is cool!,"Sunroof, navigation system, audio controls on steering wheel, exterior design, and iPod connector.",None so far.
4.375,Great car,wizard2788 ,08/09/2007,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,4,5,It's a pretty good car for an affordable price. Very good looking and decent mileage as well as performance. Comes with lots of great standard features and no need to spend more time/money trying to add features.,iPod hookup and music control on the steering wheel. Very easy to listen to all of your songs. Comes standard with subwoofer beneath the trunk. Good exterior design.,"Interior looks pretty good but does have a lot of plastic. Better material for the interior and better quality seats. Seats look fine tho. Coming standard with a turbocharger would be awesome. Car can be made to go a bit faster. Last, better quality tires... bad traction in wet roads sometimes."
5,I Love My Car!!,Dezire ,08/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,As an owner I say it is a very sporty and classy car with a lot of power and is smooth to drive. I'll recommend this car to anyone!,My favorite feature is the iPod connection and pretty much everything!,None.
4.875,Best bang for the buck,Vladimir ,08/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Excellent car for the money.  You simply can not find a car at this price with so many features.  The engine is very ""torquey"" for a 4 cylinder and delivers great acceleration.  The number of additions available to this car is also amazing. The gas mileage is good, but isn't outstanding.  The new headlights and tailights really made the exterior go from average looking to attractive looking (especially with the pedestal spoiler).  The manual transmision shifts very well, just as well as my old prelude.  The handling is ok, could be more responsive. ","""Big"" 4 cylinder, standard features, new headlights and tail lights. ","More aggressive handling, lower the car a little."
4.875,Best car so far!!!,lauchard ,08/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,After going from my 13 yr old base style Corolla to this standard loaded out car I feel like I've hit the jackpot for a great price.  I absolutely love it.  It has pep and looks very smart.  This is my favorite car I've ever had.  Well worth every penny even if you don't add a thing.  Feels like I'm gliding on glass it is so smooth.  With the Toyota name behind it you can't go wrong.  Get one!!,"Panoramic sunroof, 17"" wheels, dash design, everything really.",Can't find anything yet and don't think I will!
5,2008 Scion tC,scribble ,07/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Absolutely wonderful car!  It has a good deal of power for a 4 cylinder, and despite the mileage ratings I'm averaging 27-28 mpg with mixed city and highway driving.  The tC comes loaded from the factory with everything a buyer could want.  The upgraded stereo is worth the extra price and sounds awesome (for most users at least).  I have no regrets about buying this car.","The glass moonroof, stereo, overall style, engine, slick clutch and 5 spd.",The front seats could use more lateral support for more spirited driving.
4.75,"It's a well built car, original, smooth.",Dtc ,07/20/07 23:43 PM (PDT),5,4,5,5,4,5,5,5," It's worth every penny, custom it out the way you want. It's designed by Lexus so you know you're getting quality. I get about 22 mpg and I have a 6.5 mile drive to work. I think they could have designed the seats better but that can be fixed with custom leather. But I would have lowered it a little more from the factory. Overall I feel that I made a good decision buying this car. The car is much quieter than I thought but the toyoguard package was well worth the money. Toyota has quality products period.","The upgraded audio, Pioneer, the sunroof/ moonroof, the outside design,  and the MPG.","More room, seat styling, lower to the ground."
4.75,Very overall nice ride!,Trig ,07/19/07 07:05 AM (PDT),5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5, I am very impressed with this year's tC.  I love the new tail lights and orange illumation in the dash.  Rides very smooth and quiet for a sports-like car.  The price isn't bad either (for everything that comes standard).  Highly recommended to anyone who loves a nice ride with pretty good pick up. ,"Moonroof, premium upgrade audio system, and 17"" alloy wheels.","Standard subwoofer, tailights, and standard side and curtain airbags. "
4.875,Very exciting car!,Kevin Khaotic ,07/07/07 09:25 AM (PDT),5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5," I purchased a 2008 Scion tC with fog lights, pedestal spoiler and premium sound system. Overall I am very impressed with its performance. It handles turns very well and has a bite to it when accelerating. The sound system is good and the car is very quiet, and responsive.  A couple of things about it though, it has a cigarette lighter built in but no ash tray. It has an auxiliary mode for an iPod but no place to plug an iPod in. These are all optional features I did not get but in hindsight should have. The bucket seats are nice but a little stiff making long rides a bit tiring, and the back window provides a couple of blind spots but overall the car is very fun to drive.",Panoramic sun/moon roof. ,Standard iPod port and ashtray.
4.875,08 tC,Kimy ,06/19/07 20:26 PM (PDT),5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5," I wish it had come standard with the spoiler. Other than that, I love it. The back is very roomy and there is a lot of storage space!","The rear hatch, radio controls on the steering wheel. The new headlights and tail lights. ",Nothing yet.
