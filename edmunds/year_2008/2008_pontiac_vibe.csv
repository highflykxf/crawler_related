5,"70k miles, no issues",JMWDC ,12/29/2015,5,3,5,,,5,3,4,5,,,"This car is outstanding. We also own a 4 years newer, $10,000 more expensive Subaru and the Vibe blows that car out of the water in nearly every area. Two things that I'd like to see better on the Vibe would be: better snow/ice handling. If you don't have the ABS option and live in a snowy/icy climate it's a little bit of a lightweight car. The second would be acceleration, as the Vibe seems a bit underpowered. When I put the gas to the floor for a quick highway onramp, for example, it's a veryyyy slowwww acceleration.But otherwise it's a fantastic car. The reliability is absurd, especially for what you might hear about Pontiac, I've never had to do any non-routine repairs. I attribute that to the joint-venture with Toyota (all of the guts of this car are Toyota with the superior trimmings/finishing touches of American manufacturers - really the best of both worlds).They redid this car for the 2009 model year and the newer Vibe I found displeasing. The sightlines of my 2008 are outstanding but they shrunk the rear window and some others are harder to see out of in the newer ones. All in all I have no complaints, I could see this being a 150,000+ mile car at the rate it's going.",,

I have had it 10 yrs. has been a great car for me, if I had the money and could get another car I would search for another Vibe... I am sadden they don't make them any longer. I don't like sun roofs, but the inside of the 2004 vibe is the style I would search for .. 2004--2008/// Great car in my eyes and heart..

5,So good I bought it twice!,Breeze ,09/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my 1st Vibe in 2003. I  loved it. I am a park ranger but grew up in the city, this car was the best of both! It has nice style for the city yet it was perfect when I moved to Yellowstone. The back has ample space to fit all sorts of gear and the roof rack adds extra space. Front pass. seat flips down so when I bought 10 foot 2X4's they fit perfectly. Even if they had been longer I would not worry cause back window pops open! While traveling X country I recharged by AA batt. using the 2 prong outlet in dashboard. After hiking I throw my dirty boots in the trunk & never worry about a mess cause it is durable plastic. Never had a prob. In June I got 2008, gave 2003 to mom- she loves it","Two prong outlet, flip down seats, durable plastic trunk and the Engine is a Toyota!",For the price- NONE!

5,Is this really an American Car,Skeets ,01/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I guess I picked the fully loaded version GT, which has everything everyone wants. In comparison to my Ford Explorer, it is small but roomy. Handles pretty well in wet and slick conditions as long as I don't try to put her on test by making sharp turns. Traction control is awsome, kept me straight on the road in past snowy days. It is not designed by Toyota but GM and Toyota has several projects done together under the name of Nummi. Just like Ford had been building Mercurry Villager and Nissan Quests on the same assembly line but general public does not know the inside facts.","Lots of room for luggage and after folding rear seats.

5,All around great,Rocketman ,11/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Only problem I've had was the auto trans not shifting into the next gear at the end of a 550 mile trip, but that could have been the terrain. The seats are nice and hug you so that if you drive sporty you wont slide off on sharp turns. Tons of space if you need it. I got a loaded sun and sound, auto, preferred, monotone 08 Vibe for 18K out the door because they redesigned them for 2009 and pushing the 2008's out. Get a 2008 if you can! The MPG is great, really worth it because you get a nice zip without ruining your wallet.","Hatchback makes life easier from parallel parking to transporting things. I really feel like I have the interior space of an SUV, just lower to the ground. I like the premium sound system and I think it's definitely worth it if you like to experience music.","Keyless lock should make a sound when you lock the car (such as a short beep).

I threw a beach cruiser bike in the back with no trouble, plenty of room, didn't even put the front seat down! Had an antenna ipod adapter installed so I can play my iPOD...yay! ONLY thing I am not thrilled about is that I did not get white!  This color (a blue-green) shows every speck of dust!

5,First Time Owner,Jerry -  Bloomington ,07/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The visibility, fuel economy and cargo space for us is outstanding. GM is missing the boat by not promoting it more on TV.  The joint venture between Toyota and GM is  evident regarding the motor and drivetrain quality. Our experience in wind, rain and snow has been good. Vehicle has good heater and air conditioning. Can't afford a convertible so the sunroof gives us our fresh air fix.  We have driven it on 500 mile trips and at 2600 rpm it is just whispering down the road.  Sitting comfort for 2-3 hours at a time was excellent. The car is only half of our joy. The other half is the dealer who takes care of it for us. Most of our driving is in the city but I would recommend it to anyone. ",visibility is great because of elevated seating. Fuel efficiency compliments our driving needs. We get 26-28 mpg in city and 35-37 on highway. We do follow all speed limits but do drive 67 on highway. AC does not pull car down. Cargo space is great for walker and other needs to transport.

4.625,Who approved the '09 design?,Burns1210 ,06/28/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"I've had the Vibe for a month and I'm liking it so far. As mentioned in other reviews, it seriously needs a telescoping steering wheel. The despicably low center arm rest can be replaced with a Corolla arm rest for much better comfort. The roof rack- less roof rack makes no sense. The cross bars used to be standard. Have to unscrew the antenna to use it anyway. The upgrade stereo is nice, so are the alloys. I like the head rest positioning, never had a car that I could actually rest my head on the head rest while driving. Plenty of rear seat room, and cargo carpet and bungee tie-downs are a must-have.

4.5,Hatchback Problem,Kay ,06/23/2008,,,5,5,1,5,,5,5,5,5,"As you can see from our ratings, we are enjoying the comfort and gas mileage of our Vibe.  However, we are experiencing one problem other Vibe owners do not seem to be having: a poor fitting hatchback.  We live on a dirt road and dust accumulates inside the hatchback top, bottom and side ridges.  Moisture, leaves,  and twigs also are in evidence when it rains.  Daylight is seen through the top of the hatchback when it is closed.  This is either a poor design or a fabrication error.  We intend to pursue this problem directly with General Motors as the dealership was unresponsive.","The 5-speed manual is fun to drive and we are getting 39 mph on the highway and almost 30 in town.  The storage area is great with the seats down.  Overall, it is a great-looking car. ",Improvement of the hatchback problem would make this an excellent automobile.

Used for vacation and was pleased with capacity, mileage, responsiveness and comfort.  Was surprised that there was not much noticeable road noise in most circumstances. A little stiffer suspension than expected on rough roads.","Cargo space and functionality are excellent. Fun to drive.  Responsive, good acceleration, good gas mileage.

5,Nice little car,Wayne J. Erhart ,04/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was on a business trip in San Diego and rented a Vibe in 2006. Before I arrived at my Motel, I was very impressed with this car. I am 6 foot 6 inches tall and fit very well in it. What really sold me was how little fuel it took. I now own a 2008 and average 33-35 mpg in town and 36 to 39 mpg on the highway. By the way it is a 5-speed, which is a hoot to drive, especially around town. Thanks for a great little car Pontiac! ",How well a tall person fits. Very user friendly dash. Great fuel mileage.

I get consistently 34 to 36 mpg. which gives me around a 400 mile range I average 37 mpg with non-ethanol gas. It handles well in the snow with the front wheel drive and my manual transmission (which I had to search for) I traded a gas guzzling trailblazer for it and the vibe is just as much fun to drive. I love this car and would definitely considering buying another at trade in time. ","I love the optional 5 spd. manual transmission which I would highly recommend. I tried an automatic which lacked acceleration and pep. the 5 spd changed the whole equation. the sun roof, folding seats, rear suv style door, handling, side curtain air bags and fuel economy make this a great car","the cloth seats are hard to keep clean, I would recommend leather. the paint seems to scuff easily, other than that I have no complaints as of yet"

I have owned it for a little over a month, and have been very happy with it so far.  It has a fair amount of pep, but will never be mistaken for a six cylinder.  To me this is a fair trade-off for the great gas mileage.  My average mileage has been 26 MPG with heavy city driving.  The steering is responsive on dry pavement and the car is very predictable driving in the snow.  This car is a great car to run around town with your kids or take a trip",I like the versitality of storage in the Vibe.  I can transport just about anything I need to.  The heat and air conditioning blower delivers alot of air.  The 110 volt plug is great.,"A wider range in the ""tilt"" for the steering wheel would be nice.
