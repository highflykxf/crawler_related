5,Still a fun and economical ride,Endless Sky ,07/02/2016,3,5,5,,,5,5,4,4,,,"Own a 2008 VR6 model for almost 5 years now.  It did have a couple of annoying leaks that I fixed. Thank goodness for vweosclub.com! No mechanical problems what so ever though. I did replace the battery(s). Note that the V6 model has 2 x 6V batteries in the trunk. To me, it's not a fast car off the line with the excessive torque and being front wheel drive. Beyond that, acceleration is decent, especially in sport mode. Fuel economy is great, as long as you're not in sport mode. However, let me tell you that the DSG transmission in normal drive mode likes to up shift too soon to help fuel economy. You can already be in 6th gear driving at 33 mph!!! On the highway, that is fine with MPG averaging 25-28. For around town, I prefer to either put it in sport mode, or use the paddle shifters. And fuel economy can suffer greatly with average in the high teens. Regardless, it's fun driving all year round. WIth the panoramic sunroof, I can have a warm car any time of the year. Too cold out? Keep the roof closed, and the sun will heat the car. Too hot out? Close the panoramic roof cover, and roll the windows down (or use AC). Temperature between 75-90? Put the top down! Hoping to enjoy for a few more years.",,

OK that being said I did have issues with the top sticking when closing and the turbo gaskets needed repaired around 90k Miles.  There was an electrical issue that caused the windows to spaz when it rained but the car was also 8 years old! I would take it back in a hot minute!,,

We thought ""surely there is a catch and why has this car had three owners in four years? What's going to fall apart on it?"" We were looking for a good car for our teen and something fun for us parents to drive on the weekends. You had 35K miles and not a scratch on your candy apple red body. Your white interior was a bit weathered, but you matched our family. Do you remember that first test drive? We watched in awe as your German engineered top beautifully folded down into itself and tucked snugly in the trunk. Then we got on the road, just our little family. We turned on the radio and you started playing ""because Im Happy, clap along if you know that happiness is the truth."". The truth is our family needed a little bit of happy. So, after discussion, we excitedly took you home. All of the neighbors oohed and ahhed. We took you everywhere and every time we got in, we were indeed Happy. Even in the winter, you held your own on Colorado roads. Your heated seats and heater worked great. Truthfully, though, you could have had brighter head beams, but we'll forgive you for that. You helped teach our daughter to drive and gave her a pal she was proud of and took beautiful care of. So, how cruel that only 18 months after you joined our family, a teen boy who was driving a Chevy Avalanche and texting rammed into the back of you at 20 miles an hour while you were stopped in traffic. He hit you with such force that you flew into the pick-up in front of you and you did exactly what you were built to do; you crunched up and took the impact in your front and protected the driving cage, never crushing into our teen daughter's body. She walked away with some bruised ribs from your straps and a bit of whiplash. You were pronounced totaled at the scene. But I'll never forget arriving at the scene and seeing those two huge pick-ups --one at your front and one at your rear-- with barely a scratch and our poor Happy in the middle -- crunched in front and dented in back taking the brunt of the impact for the 3-car accident...and our daughter, crying, but walking toward me. Thank you, Happy. RIP. We will always love you and miss you.",,

This EOS has not given me much problems and has never left me stranded. I bought the car used in March 2013 and aside from one issue (the panel on the hard top not opening all the way) I have never had to bring the EOS to the shop. Oil changes every 5,000 miles.

It is not really a sporty car in the sense that it can take tight curves at high speed like say, a Mazda Miata, but more like a sporty cruiser. No mechanical issues to speak of yet, so maybe I have lucked out compared to some of the other reviews written here.

Got 20K on it now; no regrets at all (well, I wish I'd gotten the three years free maintenance but that's about it). Oh, and I guess I wish i'd gotten the ipod dock instead of the generic input jack. ","The roof. the kids call it ""the transformer."" Always good value.","Bigger back seat; it's torture for an adult back there.

5,I Love My Eos,danerice ,07/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got my Eos in May 2008 and 14 months later, I still smile every time I get behind the wheel!  The hardtop/sunroof/convertible roof is brilliant.  I get stares and smiles while putting the roof up on a regular basis.  With the same 2.0 Turbo engine as the GTI, the car is peppy and fast.  The 17-inch wheels are sporty and sharp.  The leather and walnut interior is reminiscent of a car much higher priced.  The upgraded Dynaudio stereo system rocks. The Ipod adpapter and navigation system would have been nice!  My only complaints are the top-up styling isn't as slick as some other competitors, and interior noise can be an issue.  Overall, this car is a blast and I would recommend it to anyone!","The roof is the show-stopper.  I never cease to be amazed by the way it folds away so quickly and effortlessly.  The stereo rocks, the seats are super-comfortable, and I love the dual zone temperature controls.  Steering wheel controls are great, and the Direct Shift Gearbox unleashes 6-speed fun.",Future exterior styling could be a bit sportier.  The seam between the trunk lid and the body could be tighter. Interior road noise could be reduced. Back seat could be a bit roomier. Automatic shifting could be a bit smoother when pedal is floored.  Rain sensor wipers are a bit frustrating.

5,About the roof seals,eoslover ,02/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I hate to see all the bad reviews about the roof leaks. Since Edmunds doesn't allow posting links in reviews if you google ""solve eos roof seal leaks"" you will find an excellent article on keeping this car from leaking. I did a lot of research on this car before I purchased it and bought it once I read this article and knew the roof would likely not be a problem. Unfortunately, most VW dealers don't seem to stock the Krytox or know anything about this process. That said, overall this car has been great and fun for 12,000 miles. I get a solid 27 mpg with 50/50 highway/city driving. Highway yields over 30 mpg. Drove 2 hours through wicked slippery icy snow as well as can be expected for 2WD.","The top of course! That's why I bought it. The added bonus of the sun roof is priceless. Lack of drip caps come with the convertible territory. It's a trade off. This car gets the looks everywhere I go, especially with the top down. ",Minor complaints are balanced by the overall good quality. Gas door didn't want to close once in extreme frigid temps. Windows drop when door opens - this is a small problem when covered in ice. Maybe not the best car for high ice/snow areas but no complaints once things thaw.

When the key is removed from the ignition, the front windows drop slightly, thus when it is raining you get poured on. You get soaked inside the car whenever it is raining. 2. The radio antenna is in the trunk. The reception for FM and Satellite radio does not hold. While you drive the radio stations fade in and out. 3. The EOS is horrible in snow. We had to add sand bags to the trunk to allow traction when driving. In addition, when it is below 32 degrees the trunk freezes up. I now have to prepare myself when bad weather is approaching and put my snow scrapper in the back seat.

When you remove your key from the ignition the window drops slightly to let you out.  When it is raining the rain follows the track of the roof into the car along the seal and actually POURS into your lap before you can move.  You get rained on in the car! 2. The radio antenna is in the trunk.

Then when I try to put the top up, I have to press the button down to complete the cycle and then pull the button up for the top to close.

I'm getting 26-27 mpg around town, but be warned, heavy footed drivers (like my WIFE!) will get 4-5 less mpg.

It's a little light in windy conditions though. Oh, and did I mention it has a terrible blind spot! It's handling great in the snow. The sound system is great. The seats are comfy. I just adore the look. And when putting the roof down, all eyes on me. What a show!! Great car for the price!! A step up from the Cabrio of my past! I'm learning to love it more every day.","The roof, obviously, and the sound system. And I think the back seat is just for looks.",Blind spot.
4.75,Eos,Larson ,11/04/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Very nice convertible. Handles extremely well, just as one would expect with a sports car. For a 4 cyl.2.0 liter turbo engine it has a lot of go and then some. More than enough power. It is extremely quiet with the top down. Very easy for people to talk, meaning marginal wind noise.","Sporty, retractable hardtop convertible.",Adustable cup holders.
4.375,Good choice,injuryexpert ,10/01/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"My '08 Eos has had almost no problems in the first month. No leaks, no big wind noise, no build problems.  Great power and the DSG is awesome. Of course, this car is about the top - real showoff moves. It's also practical because of this top, even in the midwest. If you're looking for fun with enough room for some friends or a golf bag in the back seat, the Eos is the best choice out there.","The top, the turbo, and all the fun!","The only real quirk is the glass rolls down slightly when you're ready to open the door. When wet, that means the seats get some drippings. Not sure how to fix it, but its more an annoyance than a problem."
4.75,This car is really fun,herb ,08/18/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I have only had my new '08 VW Eos for 3 weeks now but it has been a blast!!  The 200 hp turbo is powerful, the 6 sp auto trans is smooth, can not feel the shifts, and of course, the top.  What fun it is to open or close the top and watch everyone around the car just stare.","Are you kidding?? The engine, auto trans and the top. Without any doubt, this car delivers the goods.","Garage opener, bigger center console to hold more stuff, footwell lights, but the car is very liveable w/o any changes."
