4.25,I love it!!!!,sherellem ,12/27/2012,,,5,5,3,4,,4,4,4,5,"I love the car. I am a small person so it fits me well. I get compliments everywhere I go syaing how nice the car it and how it's perfect for me. Ity's has great speed on the highway which I love, but the pick-up is a little slow. It's excellent on gas (which is a plus at these prices). Its warms up fast in cold weather, but fishtails a little in the snow (which I do not like). Overall, for the price, it's worth it. I love it a great deal. A few little adjustments and it would be perfect!!!!! I recommend it.","I adsolutley love the blue lighting, espcially at night, makes the car look and feels sporty. It has that race car look and feel. The sounds are awesome because I do like to bump my music every now and then. ",The rear-wheel drive isn't good.

5,Awesome Car,FOSGATE ,07/18/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I just got the car its an 08 GT brand spanking new and where in 2010. I was skeptic at first but when I test drove the thing damn that thing hauls. I'm glad I got that Eclipse GT. Def get the GT V6 not the 4 banger cause then you'll be missing out on all the fun. The cars got speed its quick and peels out which to me is a good thing lol. You just gotta know how to drive it if you don't want it peeling out when you need it. The exhaust and engine sound good too and the rims are nice. Def. great car to buy,"10 inch SUBWOOFER and the 6CD changer Rockford Fosgate Stereo. Also the 18"" rims and the fact that the motor packs a punch.",Add more Horse power and maybe make it rear wheel drive. But all in all the cars great 
4.75,Excellent Car,Rob ,09/22/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I used to have a 98' Eclipse GS, lasted 11 years so I decided to trade it in for a 08. I have never been happier with my car, it's stylish enough for me and affordable, gets good gas mileage in my opinion, and is a smooth ride and yes I'll admit I've had it at its max 155 on a interstate, it rides very smooth even at that speed. If only it didn't have so much weight in it. 3550 lbs is a lot for a sports car and makes cornering devastating on your tires unless you take them extremely slow. Corning can use some work but even my last Eclipse turned like a Semi-truck so I'm used to it. All in all, I love my car and it attracts attention.","Stock sound system, smooth ride, sleek design, comfortable seats, interior lights at night pleasant on the eyes.","No back seat room, WEIGHT! You especially feel it in cornering and accelerating, Turning radius, Navigation would be a wonderful feature. Stock radio should be able to hook up with an I-Pod as well."

I have the V6 GT SE, so mine has a few more bells & whistles than most.  It's a fun ride, not great in the snow, but not a death trap either.  I threw an intake on it to give it a bit more oomph and a nice engine sound.  With a few mods this will be a beast.  Stock, it's definitely a solid buy.",The stereo,"Turning radius, seat A/C - not just heat"
3.5,Huge Turning Radius,Keith ,02/05/2009,,,2,4,4,4,,3,3,4,4,"Overall, I am very happy with this vehicle.  I think the interior could be ""spiffed up"" a bit, but generally it is ok.  The blue dash is great at night.  The only real issue I have is that for being such a small car, it weighs a lot, and the turning radius is that of a Super Duty Pickup.  Allow yourself plenty of swing when trying to fit into a parking space!",,

I bought the car for the safety rating and airbags.  She and her passenger flipped end over end 3 times before coming to a rest 50 ft from the highway on the roof of the vehicle.  They were going 75 (the speed limit on this hwy).  They both walked away with minor scratches.  THANK YOU Mitsubishi for your excellent car - it saved my kid's life.,6 airbags!  Safety ratings,N/A
5,Love this car,Laurie ,11/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love the way this car handles. The four cylinder engine performs great and gets good fuel economy.

So far I have 20k miles on my 2008 and have not had any problems.  Insurance is very reasonable, gas mileage is great (30 mpg), and I don't see many on the road so I get lots of looks!",Nice balance between sporty handling and comfortable ride.

4.5,All around great car,chris ,08/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"I am very happy with my purchase, car has been flawless so far. Great performance for the money and awesome styling. Visibility is a major problem though. Car also likes to get silly when pushed hard in corners when flooring it. Car should have at least came with a LSD or AWD. Interior also should have higher quality. Although nice enough for most people the interior materials don't belong on a 30K car. All around Great buy with a lot of potential. Just with a CAI performance and engine sound is night and day. In the end you get a little more than what you pay before.",The styling and the overall profile are great. I love the the overall balance of this car. Its not the best in anything but really shines as an all around car for the street that you can tolerate to drive everyday,"Bigger brakes, better tires, tighter suspension, back to Infinity sound system, stop going bigger on the engines and put a 3.0 turbo in it!

3.75,"Big Engine, Sloppy Car",fiveskin ,05/16/2008,,,2,4,4,5,,4,4,4,3,"This was engineered as more of a pretty car than a useful one. It weighs too much for a sport coupe(>3500 lb), the turning circle is ridiculously wide (40 ft) and that's pretty much SUV territory. It also has numerous blind spots such as wide pillars and tiny side windows. The side mirrors are also too small. You will definitely have problems parking this car in a tight space. There is a noticeable under steer. The interior also suffers from cheap looking materials even with the leather option. The plastics are all over the place such as the door handle and middle dash, it almost feels like you're sitting in a toy-car. The rear seat is expectedly only useful for storage.

Fun to drive, corners well, 4 cylinder is plenty fast. Excellent sound system, leather seating is a bit stiff but overall comfort is fine. Very quiet interior, which reminds me of a cockpit of a race car! Must know how to drive this vehicle as there are plenty of blind spots. Pricing is modest, the warranty is one of the best out there, period! Not to mention the safety features are incredible, what with 6 air bags and steel- reinforced doors. Overall, what a beautiful vehicle at a very affordable price! Mitsubishi and Toyota are one in the same as far as value vehicles.","Front and rear spoilers, sound system, safety features, modest pricing, power sun roof, leather seats, blue instrumentation (light show), quickness, front-wheel drive, over-all looks, leather-wrapped steering wheel, corners well, warranty that is second to none! What a rush to drive this vehicle!","Locking gas cap, interior could be better equipped; manual center console has common-looking screws, not many instruments to look at or play with.

For a 4 cylinder, it has a lot of get-up and go!  I got the SE edition that includes the sunroof and the awesome Rock Ford Fosgate sound system (includes a subwoofer in the trunk).  It also has the nifty front and rear spoilers that makes the appearance very sharp.  So far I can tell a big improvement between this car and my truck I owned.

The way it looks, the way it feels when you drive it, the 650 Watts sound system is great. The back seats may be small but who's to carry around but either your girl/boy friend. Good price for a good sports car. Leather seats are nice. Great acceleration and nice power V6 engine. All In All Love the Performance.

All were nice cars if you are 5'4 and weigh 98 pounds. At 6'1"" I found the Eclipse the easiest to get in and out of. The exterior styling of this cars is sleek and sexy. Back seat room is non existent but honestly, who really cares. Seats are comfortable enough. The non turbo V6 is strong with lots of torque and surprising little torque steer which makes for lots of acceleration fun. It doesn't have road rally/oval track curve hugging  ability that the Evo or Vette has but for everyday around town and nimble freeway driving it is great fun and hard to beat. ","Nice driving position, strong engine, relative comfort, sexy styling, Mitsubishi reliability/warranty, competitive pricing, Some complain about blind spots but visibility is better than many ""sports"" cars in its class and  if your mirrors are adjusted properly there are virtually no blind spots.

4.625,A Tiger in Disguise,ChrisGT ,01/03/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Like a Tiger waiting to pounce, the Mitsubishi Eclipse GT, matches the same poise and agility. Cool and calm, it meanders through traffic, maintaining a firm grip on virtually any surface, but when the moment arises, can leap into the forefront, leaving others wondering ... what was that????  A head turner, it's exterior is quite unique to the market, and heralds the same design quality that made the Porsche 911 back in 1962.  Interior wise, all the ameneties point to the driver, assuring a comfort level that is always within arms reach.  To date, Mitsubishi has remained true to it committment in support of their products. For a re-design, it is quite impressively put together.","Powertrain and engine work in an orchestrated fashion where one complements the other. Need power? No problem with the GT. Just ask and it provides, with plenty in reserve. The sound system was designed for this car, and provides an acoustic level ranging from detailed symphony, to heart thumping!",Location of the cup holders need to be re-thought. The back seat should be redesigned for the North American market. Even with kids it's still not comfortable enough. GPS would have been a nice optional (or standard) addition. 
4,We Love It But There Are Problems,argentum ,09/09/2007,,,2,5,2,4,,5,5,4,5,"This car reminds me in some ways of the pony cars of yesteryear. It's heavy, wide and long and low to the ground. But of course it's way better. The 6 cyl is more responsive than most of the old 8s. The car handles far more sweetly and the inside is quiet. Even though the ride is tight, its not too hard. And all around mpg is always over 20. There are problems though. During fairly hard cornering on right turns there is a noise from the left side that sounds like a blown cv joint. Slowing down at highway speeds produces some serious vibration especially in the steering wheel.Interior fit and finish is awful.",The leather seats are comfy and supportive. The Rockford Fosgate sound system is incredible. The automatic trans is smooth as silk and eagerly downshifts without overreacting to too low a gear. It looks awesome but you already knew that.

5,Best Buy!,EclipseOwner ,07/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased a 2008 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS with the sportronic transmission. My Eclipse has the 650 watt Rockford Fosgate sound system which is excellent.  I have had the car for 3 weeks now and it is an amazing car, it is fast even with the 4 cylinder and gets 31 mpg. It has a surprisingly spacious interior and I'm 6 foot 1 so it has a large cabin. The car is very easy to take care of and is a great buy. I used to have a 2006 Eclipse but I was in an accident in April that totalled it. The Eclipse is extremely safe because in my accident I was in a head on collision with a Cadilac Escalade and I was completely safe.",My favorite feature has to be the sportronic transmission. It is just like a manual transmission minus the clutch. My second favorite feature is the automatic sealing doors. When you close the doors the windows automatically seal reducing road noise and prevent leaks. ,My only suggested improvement is just getting rid of the back seat because it is so small only small children and pets could fit in it. The back seat is really just a small storage space not much of a seat. That is the only improvement I have for the 2008 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS.
