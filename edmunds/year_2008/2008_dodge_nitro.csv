It has been absolutely fantastic with upkeep (just brakes, oil changes and other routine maintenance). Nitro gets great gas mileage for an SUV (avg around 22mi/gallon combined city/hwy & I live in the mountains). Great snow driving vehicle, though I would prefer a 4-low option on the all wheel drive (it just offers 4 high). Biggest downfall was the radio, which stopped working after one year (easy to replace with aftermarket radio & speakers are still great), the cheaper plastic interior pieces which have taken quite a beating from my dogs (scratches, scuffs etc), and the low front end clearance due to plastic bumper, which really limits off road capabilities.  Overall, it's been a great vehicle and we're looking to add a second one to our family!",,

Great acceleration when needed.","Improve MPG, get rid of well in back cargo space and put a thicker ""carpet"" back there, it is hard like the bed of a pick up truck."
3.25,Think Gas First,Queen ,05/15/2008,,,3,5,3,3,,3,4,1,4,"The dodge Nitro is my first car, the exterior is awesome. I would like more of a luxury feel on the inside something like the ""Ford Edge"", but for the price... This is a nice SUV, but it is very terrible on gas. This baby runs me about $60-$65.00 a week ""light travel"". DO NOT let the gas tank get below half full, you're going to have to shell out so much money to fill her up. Gas prices are steadily rising and I would NOT suggest anyone get this car unless you can really afford $350- $400 a month on gas. Its not ideal for a college student or anyone on a budget.  ",The exterior is very attractive. ,"Add a more smooth touch to the interior. More front passenger and driver oriented, it lacks ooh ahh appeal. "

2.625,Poor mileage,WWALKER ,04/17/2008,,,2,4,3,5,,2,2,1,2,"You can actually see the fuel gauge move in this vehicle. I have owned vehicles in most all styles & from all different car companies over the past 40+ years. Up until I got this nitro with the 3.7 v-6, I have always loved  Chrysler products. I was even a loyal Chrysler man back in the 1970's/ when ""build quality"" was just a word in the dictionary at Chrysler. Overall I am unhappy w/ this vehicle. I should have gotten the hemi, as it could not drink any more gas than this 3.7 does. This vehicle get the worse fuel economy of any of any vehicle that I have ever owned or driven. The 3.7 is also low on power, if you intend to make a pass, you better plan ahead & allow lots of room.",Has a great sound system - looks good - ,Footwells are small. Seats are hard & uncomfortable. You can see the cheapness in the components used to put this vehicle together. Is not the carpet supposed to fit? also there is no lockable compartment inside the vehicle.
3.125,Good for the money,Piyux ,03/25/2008,,,3,4,4,4,,2,3,2,3,"I got this vehicle as a rental for a couple of weeks, it was practically new with only 2000 miles and I had a good chance to evaluate its features so here is my opinion to be shared with you, potential Nitro buyer.  EXTERIOR: Good looking mid-size SUV. Its external design is appealing and it has the look of a tough all terrain SUV able to handle anything, I have to admit that from any angle it looks good and tall.  INTERIOR: Well distributed space, not high quality finishing but OK. I'm 6'2"" and I had no space problems, leg room was OK for driver and passengers. I feature I loved is that you can fold down all the seats creating a large cargo space for what you may need. They tried to max",Exterior looking Seats fold flat ,Suspension Acceleration Gas mileage 
4.125,A car with character and style,GB ,03/24/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,3,5,"This thing is 70 percent a Jeep. It feels and handles like a Jeep, with all these truck-like, rugged characteristics. If you want a SUV that handles like a Porsche, this is definitely not your car. But it handles quite well and predictably. I feel very safe in this car, riding in this solid box of steel ""above"" the normal traffic. There is plenty of passenger room (esp. legroom for second row passengers) and a lot (!) of cargo space with the seats folded down. It tows heavy loads with ease. The 4 wheel drive is very simple (can only be used on slippery surfaces and with low speed)but works extremely well in heavy snow or muddy roads. The interior practical, not fancy. ","The looks, this is a head-turner! The rugged, solid feel. The cargo space for all my gear. The LoadnGo feature for heavy items. The Bluetooth cell phone device (U-Connect).","The 4 speed transmission is not as good the the 5 speed transmission on the Nitro R/T. Also the suspension in the R/T is firmer, the handling better. I wish all Nitros would get the 5 speed and the firmer suspension. I had the underbody coated against corrosion. A missing feature in cold climate."
4.75,Lovin The Nitro,Yolanda H ,03/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I purchased my 2008 Nitro in December. I went from the GMC Envoy to the Nitro and I'm loving the Nitro. Road handling is great and the interior is very comfortable, I love the two-tone color of the seats, I wish there was a vortex engine to give the Nitro more power. I haven't put mine on the road yet, but I can't wait to take my first out of town trip.","The seats are really comfortable and I love the dark color of the interior, the cup holders are very sturdy, which prevents back seat spills from the kiddies.","Interior is a little basic, so some interior upgrades would really be nice."
4.75,Great in the snow!,Don ,03/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"We moved to very snowy southwest Colorado and realized we needed a SUV that was comfortable and rugged. After test driving the Ford Escape, Jeep Libery and Kia Sportage we drove the 2008 Dodge Nitro. The Nitro had the best look, most cabin room and best ride of everything we tested. Since our purchase we've had 3 major snow storms and the Nitro has been absolutly awesome getting through the deep snow.  We've also taken the Nitro on a couple of long road trips and the ride is smooth and comfortable and I love the sound of the engine when you put the pedal to the metal.","Exterior and interior design, handling, large cabin, great sound system and powerful engine.","Better fuel economy, cargo cover and more room for the drivers legs."
4.75,Love this Nitro,Keith ,02/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I've only had mine four days but I'm in love with this vehicle.  Initially was looking at other comparable SUV's and didn't even consider the Nitro until I saw one and then that's all I wanted.  I have the inferno red and it's loaded with everything from the sunroof to the 20"" chrome wheels and better suspension which are an option on the SLT.  I love the very dark tinted windows in the back half.  It's been a head turner so far and think I made a very good choice.  Can't comment on gas as I'm still on my first tank but it drives great and has decent power.  Outstanding price for what you get.  ","Looks, 20"" chrome wheels, very dark tinted windows, Sirius radio w/MP3 plug, slide out cargo floor and the 110 volt AC plug on the back of the center console so your not limited to the cigarette lighter type plugs and can use anything electrical in it.",Haven't found anything I don't like about it yet.  It could use a little beefier looking floor mats given the appearance of the SUV.  This is a mean looking car and I bought better rubber floor mats that look similar to tire treads to go over the carpeted ones.
4.875,Love to be different,christos ,01/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is an absolutely fantastic car! It is going to be a classic. I do not care what experts say it is a best value for money purchase in its class. If you do not want an egg for your car, if you want your car to be spacious, big enough for a five persons family but not too big, and quite adequate in every aspect, this is the car you should be looking for.

4.875,Nitro with an attitude,Peter ,01/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"1st new car for myself and love it. It looks rough and rugged. Body style and the ride is what hooked me along with the price. Smooth ride, nice radio, great sun roof. Plenty of room in the back for storage. Goes like butter on the beach.     ","Body style, bold and strong",Full roof rack and 2 speed transfer case. 
4.375,Love My Nitro!,Allie ,01/04/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,3,5,"I love my new Nitro!  I got the Nitro in the Red, it is very eye-catching and handles really well.  Plus it is quiet, much quieter than my 2001 Honda Odyssey.  I wanted to get away from the minivan now that my kids are getting older but really didn't want a car or big SUV so this was an excellent compromise!  I am looking forward to seeing how it handles in our winter weather.  Would recommend this car to anyone.  The only complaint I have is that the gas mileage isn't the greatest, but I am hoping this corrects itself as the car gets more ""broken in"".  Love the looks, have gotten many comments already, and my stepsons would love to drive it for me ",Snazzy exterior! Gauges and Sirius radio!,"Better gas mileage, foot pedals that move and more flexibility in steering wheel."
4.875,Love the SUV!,mkunz56 ,12/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I read the review by the customer that is obviously disgruntled, and couldn't disagree more!  I've worked in the automotive industry for years, and can't recommend the Nitro strongly enough.  The only detractor that can readily be noticed is the fuel economy; the 3.7L engine has my mileage at about 17 mpg (city).  A little excessive if you ask me, but the rest of the car more than makes up for that.  The Nitro is unbelievably stable for a vehicle its size.  I own the 4 X 4, and found it to be great in snow.  While evryone else was sliding, I was right on track.  The styling right on the money, too.  In short, you can't go wrong with this vehicle! ","Styling, sure-footedness, roomy interior (for a small SUV)",Mileage!
5,08 Nitro ,Shawn&Angel ,12/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife wanted a Jeep so I test drove everything they had and bought the Nitro instead, The reason I gave this such a good rating is based on its price compared to everything else in its category. It is not the fastest nor most powerful thing I test drove but it was 7000 less than the next competitor and had much better performance per dollar and was so much more fun to drive than the super soft inadequate feeling suspension on the grandma grocery getter Jeeps I drove.",Bang for the buck. For its price it is a much better buy than anything else and it looks so much better than other SUV's. I would have got it for looks alone if I had to buy an SUV,"Available SRT6 model with the Supercharged V6 and a higher final drive ratio for better MPG, But for its small price tag it is just fine with a naturally aspirated V6"

I purchased the 4 liter. The R/T package will also get you 20 inch wheels and a sports turned suspension. The R/T version handles as well as my Audi A4 in tight corners with this package and I am amazed at the quickness of this SUV. Very little lean.  Fuel economy is rated at 21 miles per gallon and with only 350 miles, I am getting 18.2mpg. The interior fits my style and is very confortable. The slide and go storage is great for anyone with a sore back getting items out of the rear end. Built in GPS, subwoofer, bluetooth and 20 gig hard drive with Ipod plug in. I am happy.","Performance, sound system, Clear view out all sides of vehicle. 4WD system works great in snow. Auto dim mirrors, auto headlights and tow package with backup warning system.

Fuel economy improves with every tank, styling is unique in a sea of rolling eggs. Infinity stereo is awesome, slide and go storage is great. While cross shopping this vehicle I wound the imports to be thousands more for less performance. 2 thumbs up.","Unique style, stereo, plenty of power.",Softer interior materials - but again for the price this thing is great.

I love the all-black exterior with black leather seats. Handling seems a little top-heavy with a fairly quick tendency toward oversteer.
