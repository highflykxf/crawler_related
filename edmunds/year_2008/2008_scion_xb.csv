4,Love my little Toyota Box!,Amber abshire abshire ,11/19/2016,5,4,4,,,5,4,4,4,,,"I bought my 2008 Scion XB new in 2008. It was a great value for new at 16k and a Toyota product too! I've had next to zero issues with my car, routine oil changes, brakes and tires is all besides one sensor that was under $200 to repair. I love how easy this car is to drive and park, great visibility for me and although small looking, very spacious. Scion drivers are so friendly too, its like having a secret club where you get waved at all the time. I didn't use the warranty at all but I'd expect Scion to be competitive with the Kia Soul for a similar style and price point vehicle but sadly no. For the money it was a great problem free car that was fuel efficient and fun to drive! I'd recommend one for sure but sadly Scion stopped making them in 2015 üòê",,

5,XB Decree,Carolyn ,05/27/2016,5,4,5,,,5,4,5,5,,,"Buy an XB if you want amazing interior leg room in a small wagon, a smooth ride with the automatic model, and an interior that can go completely flat from dashboard to rear hatch to create comfortable sleeping space.  Can do just one side like that, as well, if one person wants to drive and one person wants to sleep.This car is so, so roomy inside, and yet it's so small, really, that you often can't see it in parking lots.  It can be a real workhorse, too, because the interior seat configuration that can flatten out on one side or both and you can throw lumber inside, surfboards, bikes, animal kennels - whatever.  Very versatile. Only negatives I can think of are: 1) it rides low to the ground, so if you so much as drive up too far in a parking space and hit the cement stopper, you may cosmetically damage your front bumper (have done).

I only wish Scion would make it with some performance. We know they use the same engine in the tC, so it's a mystery why they castrate the xB so deliberately. Put an engine with actual power below 4k rpm, close ratio 5 or 6 speed manual and auto choices, GOOD sound system, less body roll, NO MORE center gauges then maybe we have a car worth buying again. I've had two of these, and auto and the manual. Both have squeaks and rattles in the same places, and from new and almost new. Plasticky interior, peaky power delivery, lazy throttle response? Wow","Over 4k, engine wakes up a little bit. Decent seats, and good room inside in case I do actually need to carry anything.

I have not had any problems with this car and it is still driving like new. The key to this longevity is to keep up on the maintenance and to take care of the car. I drive over 50000 highway miles per year and get an average of 25 to 28 mpg. Good job XB.,ROOM ROOM ROOM.

4.875,"Don't Let the ""Toaster"" Deceive You",cmoriarty7 ,11/05/2013,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5," As someone who is 6'4"", I'm astounded by having 4 inches of clearance over my head when I sit in the car. At the same time, I loved having plenty of leg room in the rear even with the front seats all the way back.The trunk has held up to 4 sets of golf clubs as well. You can't go wrong with the city MPG constantly between 25-27 and the highway between 28-30. The Toyota turning radius and engine is a joy and the engine has enough pep that sub-160 HP feel like a lot more. The acceleration capability is hard to comprehend with the thought of it being a box. I never had a vital part come close to failing after 60K miles. The car also handled in a way that tire wear was incredibly slow.","SAFETY!!! I was recently in an accident with a drunk driver in which I was rear ended at 70 mph while I was doing 40. My Scion ended up being totaled after the rear axle was snapped almost in half. The bumper was destroyed and even the trunk compartment holding the spare folded in half. None of the airbags were forced to deploy. However, the Scion xB diffused the energy so well (By bending the uprights of the frame forward.) that the dull back pain only lasted for a few hours. You may think that it coming out totaled is a shame but I'm very lucky to have walked away from that at all.

","The front end sits low, which means it will scratch very easily if you hit a parking block. However, the undercarriage is made of a carbon fiber sheet that covers things like the transmission, etc. The full black interior is always a negative in any car, but unfortunately every xB is that way. There also really isn't a way to completely stop the A/C unit.

One problem I did have was with the ABS. At one point, the ABS sensor behind the right rear tire had broken open and water got inside. While it didn't fry the sensors it caused numerous lights on the dash to come on. If this ever happens it is about $850 to fix. Mine eventually turned off."

She wanted me to test drive it before she bought it. I thought it would be sluggish, BOY WAS I WRONG! This car has pep in it's step. Drives better than a V6, I think. 99% of new cars nowadays feels like a temporary car. The quality of the XB feels like 10+ years of ownership. The drive and flow feel tight and sturdy. People giving it crap for its drive needs to STHU. This car is under $20K, what do you expect? Interior room is shockingly roomy. I don't like all the crap my mom put on it.

4.5,Definately worth the money,jusbuyxb ,09/17/2011,,,5,4,4,4,,4,5,5,5,"Because I have had some experience with Toyotas, I went with the XB. For a toaster on wheels it is not that bad. The 08 has the rounded corners, didnt like the square styling. I heard some issues about heavy oil consumption. What I do is put a honey oil additive in the engine to prevent a lot of these problems. At 70K, still running like a champ. I think most people dont think about the additives to the tranny and eng which definitely make the difference. My wife loves it and coming off an American car binge my whole life, I dont mind the plasticky feel of the Scion. My wife had a PT Cruiser, or should I say PT Loser @19MPG average and now is happy with the XB @24MPG. ","I like the roomy feel, large hatchback for cargo, the toyota engine with VVT-i, Pioneer system standard, along with all the other options that come standard. Also, I live in Arizona and during the real hot periods 114+, it is nice to have freezing cold AC. The corolla I had also had good AC on it especially after I well insulated the refr lines. For a small engine, to have a good AC like this ups my rating on comfort. I do also like the gauges in the middle. The steering wheel usually gets in the way of the gauges. This way I only need to move my eyes to the right instead trying to see over or under the wheel.","Center console needs redesign.

3.875,"Some good, some bad",woodywrkng ,03/31/2011,,,4,4,4,3,,4,3,5,4,"I bought my 2008 XB used, with 26k miles at around 25 months old.It's a 5-speed model, and was at a dealership for a very nice price, perhaps because most people don't drive cars with manuals these days.Most of these Scions are holding their value very well, so it was hard to pass this one up.I'm a 50 year old guy, who's now more interested in a roomy, economical, and reliable car, than one which I hope will impress people.I've owned it for over one year now, and have some good impressions, and some not so good.Driving experience:The car handles and brakes surprisingly well.The suspension is very simple and should prove rugged and reliable.The steering ratio is quick, the turning radius short, and the suspension quite firm without being harsh.The driving position however seems at odds with the handling prowess of the car.From the drivers seat, it just doesn't feel particularly sporty.There are minimal seat adjustments, decent but not well bolstered seats, and a rather high mounted shift lever, with the end result just feeling a bit awkward if you try to drive in too agressive of a manner.While the seats are indeed better than most I found in this price/class of vehicle, it would be nice for a lumbar control or lower seat angle adjustment.The drivers seat will raise and lower, but it's pivoted at the front, thus when raised you tip forward.On the highway it's surprisingly quiet and composed for an econocar.One odd problem I've found is when wearing my size 11 work boots, my left toe rubs on the clutch pedal lever unless I pull my leg back un-naturally, while my right foot can just barely fit between the brake pedal and the center housing to reach the gas pedal.There simply isn't much room under there for an average work boot.My normal shoes don't experience this problem.There's a sizable right rear blind spot, which makes it a crap shoot backing out of an angled parking space, as well as large side view mirrors which obstruct your view to the side.If you tend to drive in nice weather with the window down and your arm hanging out, you may want to begin looking for a decent physical therapist since the window opening is quite high and you'll eventually tear your rotator cuff.Winter driving:The standard tires are round, and that's about it.The traction control works very well, asuming it's working (more later) and it's needed, due to the lame tread pattern of the Bridgestone tires, and very low ground clearance of the car.Many people lower these cars, which should make them a real adventure when encountering a pothole.Speaking of tires, the spacesaver spare is mounted on a wheel, the color of which should be called puke yellow.I reckon that's so you won't be tempted to leave it on for long.There's no discrete vent always aimed at the drivers side window to keep the side view mirror visible on frosty days, so you'll need to aim your dash vent in that direction.The passenger side has a separate vent.Perhaps it's the small wheel wells, but ice tends to form in the front wheel wells and rub on the tires, more than in most cars.Engine:Impressive low rpm punch, acceleration, snort, whatever you want to call it.This thing just plain scoots if you want it to.I do my own repairs, and the normal maintenance items are easy to find under the hood, with the parts that will eventually fail (alternator, water pump, A/C compressor) easy to see and reach.There is some chatter on a Scion forum about leaking water pumps, and mine isn't visibly leaking yet, although there is a pink stripe directly above the pump on the underside of the hood.Gas mileage-wise, I get 23-26 in city winter driving, in the cold state of Iowa, which I feel is fine since my daily commute is only a few miles each way.In warm weather the number rises to 25-28 in town, and up to 35 on a mixture of 55 and 65 mph roads.These figures are when the car is carefully driven however.Transmission:A smooth but long throw hydraulic clutch, widely spaced gear ratios, and a high mounted shifter without a reverse lock result in a car that doesn't ask to be driven aggressively.It took me a few weeks of driving to make nice smooth shifts.People do praise the automatic transmission, but I never drove one.65 mph occurs at 2700 rpm, which is fairly normal for a car like this, although I do feel the car has the power to be geared higher.Interior:I like the blank dash in front of my face when looking straight down the road.Having the instruments slightly to the right gives you an un-cluttered view of where you're going, which is a good thing.A few of the oddities are slightly annoying however.The only clock is part of the trip computer, which has 8 functions.You can only view one at a time, so if you're watching the gas mileage, you don't see the clock.If you could choose which function to view from the steering wheel there would be no problem, but you can't.The standard radio is actually closer to the passenger than the driver, which is a bit odd, and the climate control's temperature knob is behind the shifter knob when in odd numbered gears.Speaking of the standard Pioneer stereo system, it's impressive.I'm an audio nut from long ago, and can honestly say that unless you're a kid wishing to annoy entire neighborhoods with hip-hop, you won't be upset with the sound quality, assuming you learn how to use the various features of the stereo.Most factory stereos in a car of this price are fairly basic, but this one is a nice surprise.Well done Scion.The interior feels cavernous, with easy access (meeting the approval of my 89 year old Mom), backseat legroom like a limo, and enough hard surfaces to create echos.The center console is a few inches too low to be of any use as an armrest, but its storage area is deep enough to hold CDs.The drivers seat has a fold down arm rest, that gets in the way of the seat belt when up, so that's a minor annoyance.There's a storage area under the rear seats, which is a fine idea, except that whatever you putunder there tends to slide around a lot on the hard plastic.I recently loaded a standard sized kitchen range into the rear and closed the hatch, so there is indeed lots of useful space.Exterior:Yeah, it's odd looking, so what?It would be nice to have a key lock for the rear hatch, just in case.The only keyhole on the outside of the car is for the driver's door.The roof is the longest, flattest expanse seen since the early 70's full sized station wagons, which is a good thing since I use an aftermarket roof rack for a canoe or kayak, and the further apart the bars are, the better.The paint seems to be very thin and dainty.It's just too easy to scratch, so you'll be needing a container of touch-up paint, which judging from the price at the Scion dealer, contains precious metals and diamonds.Problems:Being the first year for this model, there are indeed some bugs.Some quite serious and pricy, if they occur after the warranty expires.In my case, my anti-lock brakes, traction control, and stability control are now kaput due to a known problem with a rear wheel speed sensor, and being two months out of warranty, I'm looking at a 700 - 900 dollar repair.And that's only for one of the sensors.Double that number when the other one fails.It seems as though they aren't waterproof.Scion knows about the problem, there's a TSB on it, but chooses not to issue a recall or an extended warranty on this issue.Since it concerns most of the safety functions of the car, I find that disturbing.There are also issues with the water pump, electric power steering, windshield cracking, and an assortment of creaks and groans to name a few.Overall, I'm basically pleased with the car, but disturbed by the reliabilty concerns.It reminds me of the Ford Fiestas from the late 70's, on a larger scale, but without the simplicity and reliability.

With the completely new design for 2008, it's not as boxy as the earlier versions.  The ""chop- top"" look is misleading since the room in the XB is huge.  I've also noticed the incredible fuel mileage.  From the Cressida we had at 12-15 miles/gal to the 20-28 miles we're getting with the XB, its saving a lot on gas.  Albeit fun to drive, it's comforting knowing the car is encased in a safe cage and airbags and curtain airbags make the XB an incredible value.

Gas mileage has been fantastic, went from Cleveland to Chicago and back and got 32.5 mpg round trip!  All city driving hasn't went below 24mpg.

Tried to trade on anther toyota product and found it was worth 6500 less than what I had paid for it.  Wanted a Yaris for fuel economy but bought a loaded KIA M/van for 50 less a month than a base yaris.  Also trim on roof blew off going down interstate and hit another car. POOR WORKMANSHIP ON SCION.  You can tell it is the LOW end of Toyota. Back seat bottom is cheesy and uncomfortable.

While I wish the automatic had the 5 speed transmission of the Camry, it shifts without a sudden jerk and scream of the revs from the down shift. I love the lounger configuration that allows you, as a passenger, to sit with your feet up from the back seat. Handles like a sports car. I couldn't imagine how it would handle with all of the TRD options: supercharger, racing springs, sway bars, etc. Interior has enough room for my son to sit comfortably behind me (6'3"" driver, 6'4"" in the back seat.

Everybody that gets inside simply can't believe how much space is in there, 5 can fit quite comfortably.  I call it my TARDIS. I live in the Rocky Mountains and so far its handled the snow very well. Just be careful, this puppy sits very low, only about 5'' of ground clearance which will be lessened when I put on the TRD lowering springs ;-)  That's one of the best parts of the Scion brand; there are so, so many ways to customize your ride.  So if you're looking for a fun hot hatch and you buy anything else, you chose wrong.   ",Ain't noth'n  else like it!,Two things: 1. Longer sun visors.

4.875,Outside the demographic,oldman ,07/28/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Although I am outside the standard age demographic, they let me buy an Xb anyway. After years of driving a fairly large SUV, I was looking to go smaller and more fuel-efficient. I looked at a handful of other sedans/wagons and the Scion Xb was the only car in which I felt comfortable (I am fairly tall). In the others cars, I was either staring into the sun-visor or hunching over to see out of the front window. The Xb also has enough back seat and cargo room for traveling with my kids, a worry I had in giving up the SUV. On a recent trip, we fit four suitcases and three bags of golf clubs in the back. No more worries on space. I also got 31 MPG on that trip.","I really like the driver headroom, backseat leg room, and rear cargo space. The Xb also has a fairly peppy engine that gets good gas mileage. I cannot understand how I ever managed to drive a car without the direct connection to my iPod. Finally, I like the funky styling.",Telescoping steering wheel. Two back up taillights rather than one. A few more color choices.
4.875,32 MPG CITY,Rob ,07/25/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Looked at and drove all the contenders including Fit, Element, Matrix.  But nothing really came close for the price.  My last vehicle was the King Reliable Toyota Previa minivan.  But I wanted something much more efficient but just as reliable.  I do handy work and small remodeling projects for a living and needed some hauling ability.   The Scion xB has been doing the duty for over 4 months now and getting 32 mpg in the process.  The key to higher mpg numbers is in the 5 speed manual and coasting techniques.  I'm always looking for something better but I don't think anyone has made it yet.  For now the xB rules.  ","Center gauges - high mount 5 speed - stock stereo sound quality - interior room behind front seats - driving position (I'm 6'2"").

This was the perfect vehicle for her. She traded her Honda Accord for this vehicle. Built entirely in Japan, the quality is top notch and has yet to experience any problems. I can't believe that I can sit very comfortably in the backseat despite my 6'4"" frame and the font seat is the same. Headroom is excellent. The four cylinder Camry engine has plenty of get up and go but I wish the average MPG were better. We do mostly city driving and average 24 mpg.",Roominess. Built quality. Small size makes plenty of garage room. Road response is excellent. Chock full of safety features that are standard. Unique styling.,Key is too big - dominates the keyring. Front passenger seat doesn't have an armrest like the driver seat has and it feels flimsy though stable. Pioneer radio knob is small and too recessed.

4.125,The band broke up,Bill Turk ,07/07/2008,,,3,5,4,4,,4,5,4,4,"The Scion name when it was made was new edgy and had just about everything for everybody. But just like modern bands, you switch a member here and there, and before you know it the name Scion doesn't mean what it used to mean. Take the xB for example, the old one was great, small engine, loads of room. Sure it could have used a bigger engine, but fuel mileage for space was what counted. Then they messed with the image, put a bigger engine, but also a bigger chassis. The result is a car that is no longer what it used to be. Toyota, um, Scion just took themselves out of the market that the Honda fit has all to itself now. The xD is no better and looks too much like the fit to kill any edge.","Loads of room, but it's too much. Rather have the engine upgrade but same size xB as last generation. Great if you want a van with better mileage. ","Change the badge since the Scion name used to appeal to the young (gen Y) audience. Now 65% of xB buyers are over 35.

Ability to add Toyota Racing Division parts makes it something I can personalize, Toyota reliability and service is reassuring. My Mercedes was always in the shop, my xB only goes in for oil changes.    Think inside ""the box."" ","#1: xB has EVERY safety feature my Mercedes had (except the 3 listed below) and that was critical. GREAT stereo GPS mapping, fold-down seats, my friends say the back seats are MORE comfortable than the seats were in the Mercedes! They fold down for hauling capacity. My dog loves it! ROOMY storage. ","For safety reasons:  (1) I REALLY miss auto-on headlights, (2) heated rear view mirrors, and (3) although the front seats are adjustable, the range of adjustment does not include height, and as such, is inadequate.

Poor seating position, steering wheel too far away, pedals too close together. Driver armrest is useless, same for the door armrest.

The interior is quiet, and visibility is very good, except the low top of the front windshield causes me to stay back from stoplights a little more than normal.  Drawbacks: only one speed for variable front windshield wiper, no lock on the glove box, and rear seats are not comfortable on longer trips.

I quickly put a hitch on the end to enable the transport of two bicycles and can state you cannot tell two bicycles are mounted to the back end.

My fiance who is 6'4 could not fit in my old car and was amazed at how much room the XB has. Everyone that sees the interior is shocked at how big it is since it looks so small from the outside. I got it in white and I love the way it looks with the tinted windows and the dark interior. Very happy with all of the standard features, I have not added any options at all. I shopped around for almost 6 months trying to find the ""perfect"" car for me and this is it. When compared to other similar vehicles, the XB really gives you more features for less money.",Love the way it drives and handles. Interior and dash display are cool. Seats are very comfy.

4.875,A few days in.,Genki ,05/06/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just bought this car about 3 days ago and already I can see some fantastic features. Some of the notable upgrades from my '05 Chevy Colorado are the center mounted gauges that make it easier for someone like myself being 6'3"", to see them without the steering wheel interfering. This is the first vehicle outside of larger SUVs and some of the larger extended cab trucks that allow a 6'+ person to sit directly behind a 6'+ driver and not have to be awkwardly positioned to the side. Last thing to mention is that the only upgrade I have with mine is the improved sound system with the stereo head unit that includes the RCA outputs, which is the best system for the money that I've seen yet.","Great standard features such as 4 ABS disc breaks and side impact / curtain airbags. for having paid 17,700 I didn't expect these features to be standard as they are upgrades for many of the more expensive cars.","Arm rest is poorly placed (though it's not bad once you stop thinking about it) and there's only one for the driver.

Right now on my MPG display it says 33 mpg with 120 highway miles and a touch of city.  I usually end my tank with about 26-29 mpg which I can definitely live with.  The only problem I have with the car is that the interior dash and exterior paint are both extremely easy to scratch.  I have a small dog and he has done his damage.  Both the Mazda and Ford.","Love the shape which enables you to haul practically anything (just hauled a desk last week). Ipod control, full power features standard.

As an engineer, I research all other potential vehicles thoroughly.  The xB is without doubt the best value for the price.  My attitude is that a car is an appliance and must meet a list of needs.  Scion has created a very utilitarian vehicle -- I don't care about all the style discussions.  But you might.  The vehicle has all the advanced safety features and incredible space with seats down.

A few months after, we put the TRD exhaust, racing springs, and front strut bar on, along with ASA rims and interior lights. In December 2007 I got my license, the xB, and a TRD cold air intake to go with it. Now, the handling, acceleration, sound - everything is amazing. I just can't help hitting the gas a bit to show off. The CAI sounds amazing under load. My iPod is hooked up 24/7, and I always have it playing whenever I'm in the car. Sound quality of the base stereo is great, and the bass is great, but I am looking to get a subwoofer. I'm also looking to add headers to the performance collection.","All the TRD and aftermarket stuff that's available, iPod jack, handling, massive amounts of interior space, the new looks for the 08, acceleration, engine sound with the upgrades...I love everything","There are a few rattles when i have the music turned up (volume 20-25+ or so, though I do have the bass settings maxed out). the outside front door handles rattle, and there's one inside the door panel on the driver's door which takes a firm hit to stop.

Before purchasing, I came to this site to read the many reviews,very informative.   I simply LOVE the Scion.  I was amazed how spacious the interior was.  I slipped in and out very comfortably and felt the ride was extremely easy to handle, zippy pick up.  The interior was 2 tone/very stylish. I passed on the $400 ""Teflon"" treatment from dealer and found 5 step Simonize Teflon treatment for $20 on eBay. I did get the spoiler & remote starter, mats.

","I did not upgrade the stereo Pioneer, and the stock sound system is fair.  My old Honda Accord had beautiful sound and I do notice the lesser quality.  I may shop for a better sound as the Scion upgrade didn't look too great either.  The ride could be a little softer, again maybe cause it's new. "

I'm proud to say they got it right with the improved 2008 XB.  I traded my 2005 XB in May, 2007 for the 2008 XB.  The improved model boasts a larger, 2.4 engine with A+ pickup.  Tighter, smoother suspension and a quiet, roomy cabin make this car a true delight to drive.  I've added alloy wheels, rear bumper guard, rear sway bar and Sirius satellite radio.  I like the extended trunk room and revised dashboard.  The price is right for all the extras, quality and satisfaction you'll find with the 2008 XB.  It also handled the road very well in the Western New York/Buffalo winter.  I have no regrets buying the 2008 XB.  ","It's all good!  Love the bigger engine, seats are very comfortable, roomy cabin, tighter stability and road handling.  The cabin is nice and quiet.  Easy to enter and exit the vehicle.  It has great pick up on the open road.  Favorite Feature:  The smile it brings to my face when I'm driving my XB!!","I wish the gas mileage was better, but with the upgrade in engine size and power, I can overlook that.     I would like a better reverse/back up light.  I'd also like to see heated side mirrors.  Sometimes in the winter, ice would build up on the side mirrors and it would be difficult to scrape off."

Scion xB has continued to amaze me as I use it for everything from Home Depot to camping. Plenty of interior space and it drives like a little sports car. What more can you ask for from a vehicle priced well below 20K that lets you do everything an SUV or truck can do. The new xB sacrificed MPG for more pep, and it's a great trade-off. I've had my xB for almost a year and its running like a champ. Getting about 25 mpg in mixed driving.

The first week I had it I got a speeding ticket, I did not realize I was going that fast and with the speedo to the right of driver's sight, I did not know. The multi color neon floor lights were fun but not worth the option cost. Unfortunately, the car was broadsided (pass side) and totaled. If it were not for the curtain AB, my wife would have died. ",Navi system with Alpine audio. Couple with iPod cable made th car sound like a studio fantastic. Gas mileage good. The new 2.4L Camy engine is super quick. The split auto/manual tranny is fun if you want to drive it like a sports car. Like the over all amount of room in the car. ,Move the gauges to the driver's side. Add a second back up light. Improve the driver's right side. Put two in & a tad lower and it works. Add same to pass side.

4.75,family car in disguise,Doug ,01/01/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've had my xB for four months and love it.  You get so much car and so much safety for just $16,200.  Yes, it's heavier and less fuel efficient than the old xB, but I can drive my wife and three kids in this xB with both peace of mind and some zip.  I think Scion has somewhat mis-marketed the vehicle.  It's a great family car, notwithstanding its looks.  The side airbags, VSC and traction control, four-wheel disc brakes, 2.4L engine, and that extra weight make it a smart adult car.  I drove the Honda Fit and the xD before the xB and noticed the huge difference in weight,power, and ride immediately. The xB is an incredibly safe, roomy, and practical car, one more families should consider.  ","Safety features--VSC, disc brakes, side  airbags; front and rear passenger room; quiet, comfortable ride; strong but efficient engine.",Daytime driving lights; two backup lights; passenger arm rest; stand-alone clock;  
4.625,It grows on you,David ,01/01/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This is a great vehicle.  I have put about 400 miles on it so far and have been really pleased with my purchase. The ride is a little bumpy, but going from a giant F-150 might explain the sensitivity.  I love the center mounted gauges and the trip computer is so convenient.  It gets kind of annoying having to switch between the clock and the other information on the trip computer, but for 17k I can push the button a couple times.  The upgraded stereo is a must.  It looks a whole lot better and allows for future sound expansion if desired.  All in all, I'd highly recommend this car for all people of all ages.  I'm 26 and my Dad, much older, wants one now.  MUCH better than the Honda Fit, etc","Trip computer, iPod integration, fold flat seats, cargo capacity, Limo like leg room, fuel economy (32mpg on recent trip/24mpg around town).  Quick!!!","Separate display for the clock, or put one  on the radio head unit, better tilt/tele steering wheel, the wheel covers are a bit hokey, but rims are pretty cheap if you shop around.  Make the next gen a hybrid and I'd be a Scion owner for life! "
4.875,Major Improvement!!,coldndenver ,12/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After having a 2005 xB, I decided on a whim to go check out the 2008 xB. Right when I stepped inside this car I was sold! I took a test drive and I had made my decision on the manual. I have now have 4000 miles on my new xB and would never go back to the old xB. I can't think of anything better on the old xB except for the gas mileage, but I was willing to sacrifice that for more power. The new xB does not feel like a tin can like the older models and it is an all around safer vehicle with standard side curtain airbags. Ride is much smoother (especially in high winds) and quieter. I live in Colorado and it handles well in the snow with the stability/traction control and standard ABS.","iPod integration, mounted steering wheel controls, sturdier and safer feeling than older models, larger cargo area, center mounted displays, more power, great gas mileage (28MPG), fun to drive!!",What is up with the reverse light? Daytime running lights and AWD would make this vehicle absolutely perfect!
5,Great Gas Mileage,AK ,12/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have gone 1800 miles so far and am averaging just over 32 miles a gallon. Those getting less must have a lead foot.

I had an 06 that was recently totalled and I actually really liked that vehicle.  But this is a whole new car.  1L bigger engine (almost 40% more HP), 4 wheel disk brake, cruise control, ipod/mps hookup, side air bags, more comfortable interior seats, sports stick automatic, etc.  All the extras for a minimal increase in price.  I highly recommend this car.  Very affordable, fun to drive, great gas mileage and best of all horsepower!

I only have one problem and that is the FM tuner, it makes distinct clicking and static noises every once and a while, I took it back to the dealer and they said that all 08 scion xBs do that and that i should call the corporate office and file a case if I want it fixed.",MP3 and iPod cables standard!

5,xB: The Style Wagon,LJN ,12/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"For the last seven years I've been driving a 1995 BMW 325is coupe. Although I loved the car, repair bills, two-door limitations and so-so gas mileage got me looking at a new car under warranty. After much research, I was ready to buy a Honda Fit. Then I noticed the Toyota xD was getting rave reviews and from there found the xB. For about $2,000 more than the Honda Fit, the xB delivers nice hp, great room and functionality and a whole lot more style. We got black, and my wife says it looks like a hearse. I think it has a 1940s' gangster car look. But we both love it! ",Styling inside and out. A little offbeat & funky: in the xB you rise above the mid-size sea of boring uniformity. Great cargo space and everyday functionality. Good gas mileage,"The driver armrest (right) center console needs to be more substantial. The driver's door armrest (left) should be the same height as the right armrest, not lower! Although I like the instrument cluster and styling, it's easier to drive with gauges centered above the steering wheel."
5,GREAT DEAL,dro ,12/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Fantastic car for transporting elderly parent. They can get in and out without stepping up or down to get in and out of the Scion xB.  I am also a tall person and this was the one car I can sit up in with out having to lean the seat back. A good value!!!,We like the chopped appearance of the body style. Had several people ask how long it took to complete while attending a car show in TN.  It surprised them that it was a new car with no modifications. ,Very few things can be added as options to our car as the only thing we did not have installed was the turbo and the handleing  suspension. Would like to get the rear bumper cover but the dealer is still saying not available.  
4.75,Box Rocket,Mark ,12/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I am more than impressed after 2 months of quality time with my new 2008 xB.  I highly recommend the rear sway bar, as you can take a corner with a $60,000 sports car (believe me, I've done it). The ride is smooth and quiet, and the new Camry 4 cylinder engine gives the 2008 xB a good boost of power when needed.  Add in sports stick on the automatic transmission, iPod/MP3 standard Pioneer deck, and a 50s gangster wagon exterior, and the 2008 xB is in a class of it's own.","Ipod/MP3 compatibility standard, smooth ride, low profile exterior","Rear sway bar, front strut bar.  If you don't mind a little bumpier ride, the 19"" TRD wheel package is visually appealing"

4.875,Good for a first car - My initial review,StuckinAZ ,11/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've only put a couple hundred miles on the car, but I thought I would offer an initial review. I will come back and do another one after a couple thousand miles. Any way the Scion xB meets my needs very well. Some people keep comparing it to the old xB, and saying it gets bad mpg and its not unique anymore. Well in my opinion the new xB is a better car. It takes the highways better and as well as the city.The mpg are not bad at all, I've been averaging +29 MPG, and that's 99% city. It's got a great interior with lots of leg room for both the front and back, and I can haul all my stuff. I traded in from an very large V8 Chevy 4x4 truck. Get one, you'll be glad. Its fun, frugal, cool","The auto transmissions sport shift feature. The abundance of cup holders, the cool center tach display, trip computer and miles till empty. Funky styling. Bright headlights. Decent stock stereo. Price and value. Toyota Reliability. Scions no-haggle price and first time buyer program. Inside space. ","The armrest is too high. Put the iPod connection in a better place and out of view of thieves. A security system should come standard. Better seats would be nice, they don't really support you well. A fold down middle arm rest for the back passengers. Better MPG. Needs a standalone clock. "
4.875,Awesome little box!,Thomas ,11/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a great little car. Not only is it fun to drive (I have the 5 speed manual) but I get looks everywhere I go. And it's so big inside! Tons of room! I only have 675 miles on it so far, but have averaged 27.5 miles per gallon in mixed city/hwy driving, which is a far cry from the 10-12 MPG I was getting in my F150. Build quality is better than I've seen in other cars in its price range, and I looked at a lot before I drove this one. If you're looking for a lower priced, gas sipping, fun to drive car, you should really check out the Scion xB. You'll love it!",I love the audio quality and the fact that I can control my Ipod from the stereo. The seats rock and are so comfortable. I love all the space inside!,"The sun visors need to be longer or at least have a pull out to cover the side windows. There needs to be a seperate clock on the dash or radio. I like to monitor my gas mileage, but cycling through the display from MPG to clock gets annoying. The arm rest and front cupholders need to be bigger."
5,This is the one!!,Richard ,11/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is simply said as, ""Well Built"". I love the overall package. My vehicle is white. I placed after-market 20"" chrome rims. My ride is a definite eye catcher. Riding on rims will always make a little more noise over stock rims. But it is small sacrifice for large rewards. And best of all, it's a Toyota. ""Another one for the good guys"".

The Nypnotic Teal Mica gets many stares, particularly with the black and polished aluminum wheels that I added immediately.  I travel frequently for long distances, so having cruise control is a ticket saver.  I discovered that you can be doing 80 mhp and not realize it. One of the main reasons for my decision to purchase the 08 xB was the ability to make it a very personal vehicle, its hard to beat the value for your dollar ratio. Shape, weight and power were my second reasons.","With the ability to add (Toyota & TRD) accessories for the interior: cargo cover, c-pillar storage and cargo net.  Exterior: Borla dual exhaust, cold air intake and rear sway bar.  I did an aftermarket addition:  auto on/off headlights, it saves me from remembering to turn the headlights on or off.","I think that having auto up/down windows, bluethooth and a rear accessory outlet should be standard equipment.

4.875,Just right for boomers,Fiddlerdi ,11/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I bought my first Scion a couple of weeks ago and I still go out in the garage just to look at it. It is so cool. I am a musician and it has lots of space for instruments and sound equipment with the rear seats folded flat. I travel on the highway a lot and the comfort factor is a 10 for me. You sit up high and you have panoramic view out the front windows. Everyone comments on how much room there is inside. I have the nautical blue and it is beautiful in the sunshine. I have purchased a cargo bag for the back so my groceries stay contained. I love the MP3 connection and the pioneer stereo. Mine has the spoiler too! It feels very safe on the highway and very cozy to drive. Buy one.,Overall apperance and comfort both front and back seats. Safety features. Solid feel when driving and closing the doors. I also like the locks on the key. High beams on the headlights lets you see way down the road and we have a deer problem here so they help big time. ,

4.875,Unique Car,Jose ,11/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded in a 2008 Toyota Corolla for a 2008 xB. The only thing I miss is the fuel economy (35 vs. 28 on xB, highway). But the Scion has a lot more room and comes with more standard features, like curtain airbags for rear passengers, which I required for my 3 and 6 y/o boys, VSC and ABS. The stereo sounds great/unique, and I still haven't seen another 2008 xB on the road yet! When I get to a place I like to stand out from the rest, not possible with the Corolla which is ubiquitous. In the outside the Scion xB is 10 inches shorter than the Corolla, and inside it's bigger, oh so nice. I love this car. The purchase process was very painless too.","Hatchback style, abundant interior room, yet compact in the outside, not that many people have this car, so it stands out, curtain airbags, ABS and VSC all standard; avg mileage display and real time mileage/gallon, last but no least to buy painless/quick transaction.","Could use a separate display for time, instead of sharing it with temperature, avg mileage/gallon, etc. (i.e. you can't see temperature and time at same time).

I swore I was not driving a box.  Well, this box is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned.  It has awesome power and handling. Gas mileage is wonderful since I came from a Nissan Titan.  I have all the extras like the Pioneer enhanced radio, rear spoiler, fog lights, overhead console, illuminated door sills, 17"" rims, and under dash and cupholder neon lights.  All this makes my xB even more unique than it already is.  It is a great and fun car for the price, I would recommend it to anyone.  Actually a month after I bought mine, my mom bought one too.  We are now an xB family.","All the cool features available.  Fun to drive manual transmission.  Lots of room, even with a car seat in the back.  Definitely a head turner.",More outlets since it only has one.  More packages instead of adding everything separately.  A subwoofer.  A little less boxy front end.

I am getting 26 mpg with big 18x7.5 inch rims so I am happy. Went with the teal and I still think its the best color choice available. The dash area is plain but I love all the compartments. They are much more usable with added rubber pads. The drive is a bit noisy on bigger rims/wheels, but I plan on adding my own sound deadening to the floor.","My favorite feature is how the car looks, I love it! I am also quite partial to all the cubbys and bins to put stuff. The standard iPod hookup rocks.","Offer leather as an option, please.

I checked many cars before going for another xB and in all of them I felt claustrophobic, no space at all. The new Scion fit my budget and my need for more power. It will take some time to get used to the new model, at first I did not like the older xB, then I loved it. I am sure this car shape being different will take some time to get used to too. It's way ahead of its time. I love the stance of the car and the price has no comparison with any other brand. For the same specs you need to shell from five to seven thousand more.

On the road, we get a lot of looks from passing cars. Safety features are much better. I like the way the dashboard is configured everything is in the middle. AC/heater vents are awesome; they're adjustable all ways. xB doesn¬ít have a vent for the rear; however my son feels more air coming to the rear seats cause of the configuration of the vents. It¬ís not as wide, so 3 full size people don't fit in the back.","Safety features, price, price for extended warranty, space inside, fuel economy and power, radio controls located on a steering wheel, MP3 compatibility, AC vents, dashboard features, Camry¬ís engine and reliability, such a pleasure to drive.","Bigger storage between the front seats, longer sun visor, more outlets, bigger armrest and one for passenger side, more exterior colors, bigger fuel tank, lumbar support."

However much like the ugly duckling story, I found that once I got used to the boxy looks (nowhere near as bad as last year's design) I found that I love this little car! I traded in a gas loving 2004 Ford Explorer that I had named slurpy and when I filled the Scion up for the first time I found that my gas cost were going to be cut in half and still getting about the same total mileage out of my tank as I did with my Explorer.

We like the new safety feature of a side curtain airbag. The ride is smoother, the acceleration faster, and the noise level has been greatly decreased. My wife and I have both noticed that you have to keep an eye on the speedometer as you can be going 80+ and not realize it. We got 30-32 MPG with the '05, but only get 26-28 MPG with the new '08. It handles well, but I occasionally have a problem with the ground clearance. I have to be careful backing out of driveways with a sharp drop off. The ""cyclops"" backup light is no brighter than a regular backup light, so only half the light.",The added room inside is nice. The bigger engine is nice. I really like that it's quiter and rides smoother than previous models. I really appreciate that it doesn't look so obnoxious this time.,"The improvements are nice, but not at the sacrifice of efficiency. I wondered why they didn't offer a 1.8 liter engine as an option. The old 1.5 liter engine performed just fine. Most of the colors were hidious, so we went with the white. The sound system is weak compared with the '05."

I have to say that the Scion, with its upgraded engine, seems to be a better car than the Element.  More comfortable seats, less rattles, better handling and better mileage.  I think the xB is a good value for the money when you consider expected depreciation, good mileage, Toyota reliability, and cute factor.  I think you get a lot of car for the price.","Decent factory radio, real solid feel, the car just seems screwed together tightly.  Handles great around turns, no body roll, low center of gravity, good seats for an inexpensive car, fairly quiet inside for the price range, good braking characteristics, quick for a 4cyl heavy car.","Do something with the cheesy armrest, add telescoping wheel."

I was driving a Honda Civic before, and this car is so much better in every respect - handling, power, room, style, options, ride, etc.  The only thing I miss is the 31 MPG I got with my old car - now I get about 27 (90% city).

The fuel economy is a big disappointment, not expecting this from a Toyota brand and there's also a substantial amount of road noise. It's really a 'strip' car, you have to pay for everything including floor mats! There seems to be some vibration at highway speeds (over 60 mph). The upgraded radio ($389) doesn't pick up all the stations in my area and there are 2 FM frequencies: FM1 and FM2 , this is a ripoff!! Save your money!! Overall it's a good buy for the money.","Std features, power everything, design in and out, audio controls on steering wheel.","Bigger cupholders (front and rear), improved fuel economy, less road noise and vibration.

This is by far the most practical car we have ever had.

I really like the new look!,"Larger trunk area is a real plus. Just the fact that the car is a little larger period.  Must better performing engine.  The gas mileage was much better than we expected.  We were getting almost 30 mpg on a recent trip.  Improvement on the standard radio. Scion xB is a great car, period!",Armrest for passenger would be nice.  I wasn't thrilled about the console in the middle. It's big and cumbersome and took away the convenient little storage area that I used a lot. The new one is now behind me.  Put back all the little cubby holes in the dash from the 2005. Those were useful.

No one can believe the interior room the car has. Went out on a double date and fit 4 adults in the car comfortably. I do suggest upgrading the radio to the second upgrade pioneer if you want to enhance the sound quality in the future. I have added a bazooka subwoofer aftermarket and the audio installers could not believe the quality of stereo that came from the factory. The ride is smooth for a small size vehicle.

It's super fun to drive and the functionality is superior to other cars in its class!  I was set on buying an HHR until I happened upon the Scion.  The Scion wins hands down for room!  So much leg room in front and back!  It easily fits 3 adults comfortably in the back seat!  And the price cannot be beat!  A great value!  I was leery about ""the blind spot"" in the cargo area but I have not had any problems.  The engine is peppy and gets up and goes when you want it!  And another plus is the gas mileage!  I have only had the car for a week but so far my average mpg is 30! that is a combo of city and highway!  Try one you will be impressed!","Roominess, mpg, spunky look, a unique ride that gets noticed a lot!

4.875,Awesome small UUV,Jonas Urba ,08/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is one awesome urban utility vehicle.  As more people discover that Scion finally powered it with the Camry 2.4L engine (no longer a power plant that could not pull a dead bird off a fence), expanded the interior cabin space and polished the exterior lines a bit, it should be a huge hit for Scion.  Love the black sand pearl paint job (looks like a small hearse) which fits my probate lawyer profession and personality to a tee.  It is certainly a head turner in west central Florida.  3100 pounds really helps the ride and feel surpass a mint 420 SEL I once owned.  Europe will have a tough time competing with this ride.   ","Price, weight, design (in and out), standard features (power everything is standard), tilt, cruise, audio controls on steering wheel, directionals on mirrors, everything is exceptional.",City fuel mileage could be a little better but you can purchase a lot of fuel for the few extra miles per gallon you might or might not find in a comparably designed vehicle (if you can even find one).

I decided to go with the aqua green color (Hypnotic Teal Mica) and this color/car is definitely a head turner. In fact when I was driving, my neighbors literally couldn't believe I was driving in this hip car. So after driving the car for about a good 1/2 hour this is what I have to say about it. The car on the outside doesn't look that big but on the inside there is a lot of interior. The thing I like the most about it is just how easy it is to get out and in.

Dig the styling, including the center mounted dash. Didn't think I'd like it at first, but now all cars should have it. Standard safety features are tops, and the mileage is better than the sticker advertises, especially for highway driving. Ride could be a little suppler, but then again, I'm coming from a midsize sedan so it's different.

I didn't like the room between me and the passenger, the leg room for the passenger, or the lack of getting up and going. I traded in my 06 3 days ago and got an 08. I love it!

The xB is extremely stable, staying mostly flat with very little twisting - I'd like to see what the rear sway and front strut bars would do!  Add a supercharger from TRD and we're talking head-to-head with a 328i that costs $12,000 more.  Add a TRD CAI and sport muffler, and we're talking 'bout beating that German engineering.

It was immediate, my wife and I decided we wanted to own it for many reasons.  First, safety.  Side airbags and curtains, 4 wheel disc brakes, are new in 2008.  While it is heavier than the 2004, the ride is improved, handling is improved.  Also, the longer wheelbase and length, help the ride and improved capacity for a load in the back.  More interior lights, outside temperature, readings of mpg, etc. are all new and part of the standard package.  Have received lots of questions from bystanders, inquiring about the car.

It's a real pleasure to drive and has lots of features and options that would normally be found in a much more expensive car. For a relatively small car it feels huge inside and is very comfortable. I highly recommend upgrading the stock stereo to the Scion navigation system. It's a much better sounding stereo and a great nav system all in one. I'm averaging 27.5 mpg at the moment with mostly highway driving.  I did a lot of research on the xB, Honda Element, Toyota Matrix and Dodge Caliber and the xB stood out as the clear winner. I couldn't be more pleased with my choice.",The Scion navigation system is fantastic. It's very intuitive and has lots of nice features. The iPod connector is really nice as well. The Hypnotic Teal paint job is really beautiful and needs to be seen in person to appreciate. ,"A hybrid option. Variable, intermittent wipers. Locking glove box. Passenger armrest.

Perfect in every way: power, torque, cool automatic transmission that I can shift manually because my wife wanted auto and I wanted stick. With the sport shift, I don't even need Toyota's 30 hp supercharger.  Quality is excellent, repeat excellent.  It corners better (more flat) than my old '99 Nissan Maxima SE which was rated at .79g whereas the Scion xB is .81g and the car magazines say its 0-60 mph is 7.5 seconds and 1/4 mile is 16 sec at 90mph which is same as my '99 Nissan Maxima.","Combined key and remote in one unit like German cars. Turn lights on the side mirrors like Lexus and Mercedes, Sport shift auto trans, ABS, traction control, stability control, tire pressure monitor, curtain air bags, 160 watts bass and 6 spkrs, projector headlights, clever shelf under 2nd row seats.","Sun visor needs to have an extended slide out to block the sun when you flip it to the side.  Needs daytime running lights - can't belive Scion left this safety feature out because I could have received a discount from my insurance.  Needs a sunroof option, compass in the rearview mirror."

Mine has the optional navigation in it. Hers has the deluxe Pioneer radio with XM. They are both white with automatic transmissions. Cannot believe the amount of stares we are getting from people as we drive. Overall I have only good things to say about the xB, but if there were any negatives, thus far for me it would be that the gas and brake pedals are a little to close together.","It is really hard to say. I like the styling both inside and out, but I guess I would have to say the amount of room inside for a larger than normal person to enjoy. And the fact that it comes with so many features that other companies up charge for.",As I said earlier my only real complaint is the pedal placement and I think that Toyota/ Scion should have been able provide a little better gas mileage.
4.875,Solid car,Mateo ,07/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have owned a dark blue xB for 10 days. I really love it. Before this purchase, also looked at Toyota Matrix, Chrysler PT Cruiser and Chevy HHR . Scion xB is the best among this group of small wagons. I initially targeted a Matrix, but its engine is so loud even at the idling speed and its building quality (including paint) is one tier below the xB. The xB has way many satefy features and sensors than all the other cars. ","Turning signals on the rear mirrors. Instant and cummulative computation of gas mileage. Smooth and adequate powertrain with the Camry's 2AZ-FE engine. The cute but weird look, 100 times prettier than the early xB model. Reasonable gas mileage, but only as good as my 1998 Oldsmobile 88 (3.8L V6).","I don't like the location of the shift. Whenever I try to reach the fan and AC controls, the shift blocks my hand. I wish a back-up light to be added on the rear light assembly units. The back-up light on the rear bumper looks ridiculous. I don't appreciate the tire pressure sensors, better removed."

The a/c was a little weak on a hot Georgia summer day. It didn't turn as sharply as it should. On the 2008 these small problems have been taken care of. What more could you want than a company who listens to their owners? The 2008 has been refined. The price did go up a little but it is well worth it. The 2008 is the big brother who glides with grace. The ride is smoother, quieter and the big 18 wheel trucks don't make him shake. Great work of art for Scion!! ","The most important is the safety features are standard. Even more room, smooth, proven reliable 2.4 engine. Don't worry, the gas mileage is not bad. I got 31 mpg on a 530 mile trip to Flordia at approx. 80 mph.",Bigger arm rest for driver and I think it would be nice for the passenger to have one also.

We just bought the 08 xB and we are really impressed with the ride, performance and accessibility.  We really went overboard on extras and ended up with a remarkable classy vehicle.  We added the Alpine navigation/radio system, leather interior (charcoal and ash), Camry alloy wheels and sports steering wheel.  The audio system is awesome and navigation system has largest screen I have ever seen.  You can sit and play DVD movies in the nav system while you are sitting and the surround sound is spectacular.  I recommend that you become a proud owner of one. ","Roomy, easy to get in and out of seats. It is quiet and rides nice.  Handles nice and smooth, quiet ride.

5,Best New Car in 33 Years,JimW ,06/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've purchased many new cars in 33 years, the 2008 xB is the best value, most comfortable, best equipped, and most satisfying car I've ever owned. The driving performance and standard features are amazing. Average fuel economy after 1000 miles = 30.7 MPG in mixed highway and city driving. Interior space and comfort is better than vehicles costing twice as much. Toyota's attention to design detail and build quality is exceptional. Also, in spite of the xB's massive interior space for people and cargo, the great handling, powerful engine, and small exterior size of this car make it really fun to drive! Now you will understand why all 2008 xB drivers have big smiles on their faces!","Long list of standard high-end features, amazing interior space, powerful fuel-sipping motor, Toyota design and quality, great sound system, cruise control, comfortable spacious seats in front and back, great headlights, traction and stability control, ABS, many airbags, great instrumentation, visibility.","Slightly higher armrest locations in doors, leather interior option, standard security alarm system, daytime running lights."
5,A Bang of Safety for the Buck,mikep ,06/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I only added one option to the vehicle, the 16 inch alloy wheels.  You can't get a car with more standard features and safety features than the xB for the price.  The style has improved 10-fold from the original model.  It's longer, a little wider, and about the same height.  Fuel economy could be a squeeze better, but I love the torque.  The base radio is quite adequate, and the sound is great.  The one thing I am most impressed with is how quiet the car is, road noise is almost non existent.  All this and it is so much fun to drive, and to be the first one in town with a new toy!","Road noise (or lack thereof), engine, interior space, style, instrument cluster, radio and speakers.","Arm rest is a bit thin, middle console could be taller to double as an armrest/console."

I thought my old one was great, but the new one is so much better.  It is faster, roomier, and much quieter.  It still has everything I liked about the old one but the improvements to it are amazing.  It has made my bad commute to work much easier to deal with.  I would recommend this car to anyone.

I was looking at everything in this price range and below and found nothing but blah until I saw this.

As much as I enjoyed the 06, I like the 08 a lot more, it is a much better car overall.  The 06 was perfect for commuting and trips to local places. I enjoyed driving it as long I was the only passenger but with wife, two kids and occasional third party, the fun goes away especially freeway ride > 30 miles. The 08 has addressed what the 06 lacked: power, safety, cargo behind 2nd row, lack of basic amenities, cup holders, cruise control.  However the MPG, cool styling, and fun to drive has decreased on the 08.  For me the 2.4L and safety of the 08 was worth the upgrade.  ","Auto lock/unlock when shifting gears, turn signals on side mirrors, side curtain air bags.  Bin on top left of dash.  16"" wheels, storage under 2nd row and more cargo w/ 2nd row up.

Road noise is much better than others in its class. Very roomy, young couples with a kid or two will love it. Big folks will find lots of room. Car made in Japan which is a big plus since my confidence in domestic made products has declined to low levels. Do yourself a favor and get a GPS if you do buy one, you gonna need it for all the fun driving you gonna be doing in it.","It's iPod compatible.

This wagon does every task without even breathing hard. If you need easy access and egress, safety, good looks, fuel economy, and low ""cost-to-own"" this is your car. Technically, it's amazing, pure and simple. Electric steering and brakes, stability control, antislip, smart suspension that feels more like a Lincoln Towncar than a 4 banger entry level car. In short, the xB is a car for all people, Take a test drive and see! It's marketed for young adults but we baby boomers will not be denied!","The sequential automatic transmission. I love the handling, braking, and acceleration of this car. I never feel like I'm driving a wagon or a van.","Remove the iPod plug-in and make a dedicated access point for my 8 track player....lol.

4.875,Love the Box,ronhawk62 ,06/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I've put about 1500 miles on the box in two weeks and it has been excellent, so far. I've been getting over 32 mpg on trips and about 27 in everyday commuting, way better than expected. I'm 6'3"" and have plenty of room and the ride is surprisingly quiet on the highway. The engine has excellent power and the transmission works seemlessly. It handles very well and I'm more than pleased with my purchase. I like this car better than my previous car, a 2002 Lexus ES 300, and I really liked it.","Power, fuel economy and overall roominess.",Put a passenger side armrest on the seat and upgrade the interior appointments.

5,I LOVE this car!,Lew ,06/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"It's been a week of genuine fun. I am getting 27+ mpg. The ride is smooth, quiet, lively, and very comfortable. Sure it is not a sports car but then, I don't have to fold myself into contortions to get into it. Lots of room. Yes, it's design is not for everyone, just someone who wants something well out of the mainstream. Some will think you are wacky. Hey, that's great in my book. In short it is a joy to drive! No regrets here of yet. It is one cool car, and I am not even close to Toyota's target under 30 year old.And what are people talking about, complaining about the center mounted guages. They are right there, easy to read.",Comfort! Roooom! Fun! I sprang for the sound system upgrade and am glad I did. It is excellent. ,"Minor preferences: I wish the multiple gauge scrolled regularly through time/mpg/distance/temp rather than having to pick just one, but I can't think of a thing that I would change about this car."
4.625,Best car value out there,tomrass4 ,05/30/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I traded in my 06 xB for the 08 model because it addressed the weak motor and added side air bags.  I loved my 06 xB and it is a perfect urban car where you drive in congestion and less than 45 MPH.  I do a lot of freeway driving and the new version is vastly superior in this area.  I currently have over 400 miles on it and here are my 1st impressions:  more solid, safer feel; performance is way up; ride noise is down; better base stereo; improved instrument cluster; mileage is down (28.7 mpg in mixed driving so far); visibility is down but still very good.  In conclusion, I believe this is the best car value out on the market for what you get and end up paying.  ",The iPod connector.  Larger engine.  Side airbags.  Traction/stability control. Rear spoiler (option). More cup holders. Shift mode on transmission. Larger rear area.  Drivers left foot rest.   ,"Add in a fifth speed on the automatic.  The display button has too many options (temp, avg. MPG, time, ET, etc.) when you can only show one item at a time.  Passenger arm rest."

In addition, I feel safer since it has side airbags and a higher doorline.  I do a lot of freeway driving and can merge and pass with ease now. The vehicle feels much more responsive than the original xB.  It is loaded with features for the price and feels and rides like a much pricier car.  My only quibbles are the blindspots in the rear corner, the width of the armrest, and the mushiness of the driver's seat. ","Passing power, smooth ride, more easily accessible cupholders, side and curtain airbags, iPod connector, more information in the displays.

Plus the car has an incredible amount of safety features (driver and passenger airbags, side curtain airbags, ABS, traction control).  In addition to all that, the car is really fun to drive.  It handles extremely well and really gets up and goes when you put your foot on the gas.  And the car gets very good mileage for its size.

Love the look - sleek yet boxy, really stands out. 2.  Very roomy on the inside, flat fold seats, great interior, already used to center gauges (thought it would take awhile) 3. Better fuel economy than what I traded in (2002 Suzuki Vitara) 4.  Price (great deal! I was going to have to buy used until I found the xB) 5.  Engine is nice, not too small anymore, great feel of driving.  Check it out!  ","Look, feel, black exterior black interior (can't wait to get front windows tinted too).",Maybe a 4x4 option.
