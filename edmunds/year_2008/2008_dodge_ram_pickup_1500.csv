5,"Hey, It's got a Hemi, Just bullet proof !!!",Jesse Red Horse ,08/08/2015,,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"Before considering buying one, take it for a test drive, I had done my research, talked with Friends and family who have owned Dodge Rams, read a lot online paying close attention to reviews both Pro and Con, and then waited for my local Dodge dealership to hold a special event, with info in hand I set out to actually test drive the Ram Big Horn edition complete with the iconic Bullet proof Hemi under the hood, if the trucks on the lot didn't have the Hemi power house I wasn't even going to test drive one.My advice is to select a test drive area where you will encounter, hills, sharp turns, dirt and paved road ways to get the ""feel"" of how it handles the transitions, I was amazed at the comfort of the ride for being a full sized truck, it cornered very well with no noticeable ""nose dip"" in the turns, I may have made the salesman sitting in the back a bit worried during my ""Shake down"" test drive, heck, I needed to know the truck could handle the Country roads as well as the city streets, don't you think?The leg room in the cab area is just great, sure beats any standard cab on the market today or yesterday, the controls are easy to reach and are simple to operate, I was impressed with the quality of the sound system, being a concert trained musician I enjoy listening to music without distortion, the sound system was a perfect match to the trucks interior harmonics.There is a nice amount of small storage areas through out the truck, a double storage arm rest in the front center console comes in very handy , The rear seating area fits two adults and a child comfortably, the child lock doors are a nice touch for safety reasons, the exterior road noise is muted quiet well while driving and I love the idea that the tires air pressure is monitored by computer to let the driver know when there is any air loss.One of the down sides is when it comes to replacing the trucks keys, I had three options when I needed a 2nd set of keys, Options were,1) A simple flat key that could only unlock the doors (Non computer chipped style metal key) $3.95 per key.2) Micro chipped key, can open the doors and start the truck, $77.00 per key.3) OEM Key, can open the doors, start the truck and activate the alarm system, $170.00 per key. (Ouch!)I settled for what was behind door #2 when it came to the keys.I also discovered that my truck has a ""Crash box"" installed that records all sorts of data in case of an accident, and I was a little shocked to read in the owners manual that this data will be shared with law enforcement ( By court order ) in the case of an accident, I am not sure I feel too comfortable about having a device that records 5 seconds before the accident, all actions during the event and up to 5 seconds after the car has stopped all motion in the accident. (it's the 5 seconds BEFORE that disturbs me) this means that the device is recording and storing on a loop system so when an accident does happen it will have the last 5 seconds of info before the crash event.The truck over all turns heads for sure, I catch owners of Chevy and Ford full size pick ups taking a long hard look at the beautiful lines that make up the body of the Ram Big Horn addition, and then I watch as their eyes discover the Hemi badge and then comes the drooling, I like to pass out napkins at the red lights.I was a Chevy truck man all my life until I drove my first Dodge Ram Big Horn edition, there's no going back for me now, I am hooked on the brawn and beauty of the Dodge Ram and her killer Hemi !!!The truck came with a full bed liner (nice touch) for hauling wet stuff during New England Winters, the 20"" rims pay homage to the old ""Crager"" style rims of the 60's and 70's that always made a classic car look well dressed, and who wouldn't like the powered rear sliding window, my Wife loves this feature because she can open it when a bee gets in the cab and by opening the front windows and the rear slider it will such the wasp, bee or hornet right out the back (Now this is something you will not read about in the sales materials).Yes the truck sits high off the ground but with the heavy duty step bars it makes getting up in the Captains seat a breeze, this truck is just a complete joy to own, drive and show off.And the four wheel drive, don't get me started, in snow Country there is no other way to go if you ask me, with my last truck (A Chevy C1500) 2w drive I dreaded having to make it up the hill to get home, this coming Winter will be a joy to drive in, hill, what hill I'll be asking this Winter.Enough room for up to 6 adults in the cab, that's pretty sweet all by itself but the luxury of the cab itself makes the Ram Big Horn dressed up  enough to attend a wedding, she has class enough to park out in front of any fancy Hotel and would look right at home on the grounds of any Estate.I could go on and on about why I love my Dodge Ram but I'd rather be out cruising in her than writing a review on her!",,

I have owned this truck for only a few days but in the first 100 kms the plastic grill fell apart. It was obviously broken and mended to look good by the previous owner and the dealer has stated they will help me fix the problem (Nissan).

A grand total of over $6,000 in repairs and only have 70,000 miles and use it more for a luxury vehicle than a work vehicle. I would not recommend a Dodge to anyone out there looking to purchase one.

I have owned this truck for 2 years with absolutely no problems with it (Knock on wood). Interior is kinda cheap. Lots of plastic. The body metal dents easily but mechanically it's a fine truck. This is my first dodge truck and I would not hesitate to purchase another. Well worth the money for one tough truck.","Reliability, reliability, reliability. This truck has not let me down.

After 10 months of ownership I found that I compromised a little too much regarding overall build quality. However, this truck did everything relatively well that I asked it to. It is a blast to drive with 5.7 Hemi option and very well optioned for the price. The biggest issue I noticed was it scratched and dented extremely easily which poses a major challenge when utilizing a truck for its intended use. ","Reasonably priced, Great braking, great engine performance, on demand 4x4, Leather interior was durable,
very sharp truck black with the chrome package, tows extremely well, decent gas mileage for a larger engine and a full sized truck, the 34 gallon tank was also a plus. Our Local Dodge dealership was actually relatively easy to get along with and was accommodating when they needed to be with minimal persuasion. ","Body panels dented really easily, the rear end had to be rebuilt around 42,000 miles (I didn't do any heavy towing) luckily I bought an extended Chrysler warranty otherwise my review wouldn't be as friendly. Invest in top of the bed rails and anything else you can to protect the body. I'd add a rear camera or sensors, power passenger seat, and digital climate control. "

My truck was loaded with all my belongings when I pulled in to the parking lot of a Courtyard Marriot in Lebanon, New Hampshire, close to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Facility.  As I eased into a parking space, my foot slipped from brake to accelerator and suddenly I was roaring through a wrought iron fence and flying through the air, down a 100 ft. cliff.  I was securely buckled in.  I landed on all four wheels and never moved from the comfort of the drivers seat.  The engine was still running.

I really never considered buying a RAM pickup until a friend of mine had me drive one.  I was amazed at the responsiveness of the 5.7 L HEMI; clearly a step above the Chevy and Ford.  I've now run 5 tanks of fuel through the truck and I've never had less than 18 MPG - far better than my Ford F-150 and better than my 4.7L Jeep Grand Cherokee thanks to the MDS.  The interior is not flashy, but I find the simpleness pleasing and clean.  The navigation and bluetooth is better than my Acura TL's.  The sound system is decent and the brakes are incredible.

I called the dealer to inquire about this and was told they could put as many as 5000 miles on demonstrators and still sell them as new.  I asked if they had changed the oil at 3000 and was told to bring it in and they would change the oil.  I asked about a small dent in the rear bumper and was surprised when I was told that I may have gotten bumped at Krogers or Walmart when they had put 3030 miles on it and I had put less than 300.

4.375,4x4 ... Really?,DJH ,04/29/2009,,,5,5,4,1,,5,5,5,5,I bought a 2008 1500 SLT Quad Cab Big Horn Edition 4x4 near the end on Jan. I couldn't beat the price and it looks great. The truck runs great but I screwed up when I bought this truck since it has the On-Demand 4x4 system. I warn you all do not buy a truck with these system it WILL go out and dodge has not found a fix yet. I like the truck but hate the 4wd system. It has went out 3 times in the last month. I have not went off road with the truck at all but with this system as soon as you use it a few times it will not engage the 4wd at all or it will lock in low side and not come out. I hope that dodge finds a fix soon or they will be buying back a lot of trucks due to the lemon laws.,Love the Hemi just a great truck,Hate the 4wd system (where did the old manual shift go?) Also wish there was a option for a 6-speed manual with the Hemi

The dealer says it's in the design of the truck, and that the engine downshifts from 8 to 4 cylinders.  The manager, who drove it and said it's as good as any '08 he's driven, says that I should expect a truck to have this ride-that I'm unreasonable.  The tires have been rotated and re-balanced, but no improvement.  If this ride is ""within specifications"", then my Fords must have been defective, because my Crew Cabs rode great.

The 2008 road much smoother, had more power and with the MDS, got better gas mileage. I love the truck, I love driving in the New England snow...and it has been a bad year for snow this winter. Can't wait to get it out on the sandy beaches. The gas mileage has held true, if I keep my foot off the accelerator. It's hard, because it is too much fun. It wants to break loose on the salted/sanded roads...so you have to take it easy. It turns a lot of heads too. I get a lot of looks and comments. ","POWER!!! The Hemi has plenty. The riding height on the 4X4 with 20"" wheels gives a great view of the road and traffic. My wife doesn't like climbing up (she short), but I don't want stepbars on it. I also LOVE the exhaust sound when you decide to open up the throttle, like entering the highway.","Small stuff, like built in hands free phone.

The mileage is worse than any of my previous Rams with the old 360. The rpm's constantly go up and down while cruising down the road due to the MDS constantly activating and deactivating. Every time I call a dealer and tell of the problem, they always say something is definitely wrong with it, but then after they waste several hours of my time, they say the computer doesn't show anything wrong so everything must be normal. The seats also stink compared to the '05.","The lease is the thing I like the most, because when it's up I can give the piece of junk back.","Get rid of the MDS, go to 17"" wheels, the 20's ride bad, softer seats would help."

It has plenty of power and the exhaust has a nice rumble to it. The Ram looks intimidating on the road with its huge chrome grille and 20 inch wheels.

Hemi 5.7 power plant, satellite radio, storage bin behind seats on regular cab.",The two main seats could be a little wider you feel like you are on the edge.
4.625,Love My Hemi,Mo Memi ,03/24/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Edmunds did not have my configuration as an option.  I bought the 2008 Hemi qual cab Big Horn edition.  I traded in a 2007 dakota 6 cyl. The power difference is astounding.  I could have lived without the upgrade to the Hemi before I bought it.  Now I LOVE THE HEMI.  Even though I don't drive very fast (usually), it's good to know that the power is there.  The mileage isn't very different from what I got with the dakota.  The 20"" rims & tires are gorgeous.  The truck sits up fairly high.  Came with Mopar sidesteps.  Plenty of chrome. I've added mud flaps and a cover for the bed.  The bed is soooo much larger than the dakota.  This really is a great truck.  Now I see what all the hype is for.",Hemi Hemi Hemi.  What an engine.  What a sound.  Beautiful exterior.  Cup holders are nice in the front.  Sirius radio built in with 1 year subscription.  LIFE TIME DRIVE TRAIN WARRANTY!  My dealership also gives free lifetime oil changes.  Mileage is good for a truck with so much power.,Ride is a little bumpy.  Leg room is the rear seats.  Cup holders in rear.  
3.5,Vibration,Roger Antill ,03/21/2008,,,4,5,1,1,,5,5,2,5,"Bought truck new, after about 200 miles I started feeling a vibration in the whole truck. I took it back to the dealer and they told me they have had complaints with other 1500s, did not know how to fix the problem. Waiting for a response from Chrysler which has not come yet. very dissatisfied and sick",Body style,Fuel economy
4.125,Love the Truck but...........,Teddy ,03/18/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,1,5,"I have the truck for about a year and a half now and I am very happy with it. It pulls anything I throw on the trailer with no problem.  I put  3,000 lbs of granite tiles on the bed, the truck was down on the floor but i took it 40 miles away with now problem.  It takes the abuse, the Hemi is worth the money. ","I love the truck's looks, it has lots of space inside.  Back seats are comfortable, but if you want the ultimate comfort go for the MEGA.  Lots of power coming out of the HEMI.  Don't expect a race truck with the HEMI but its got power. ",NOW for the bad stuff.  They broke into my truck in 2 minutes. How? go online like everyone else and you'll see how.  Just insert a little screwdriver under the door handle and it pops open.  Dodge should've done a better job with that. #1 stolen truck. They do not hold their value for nothing.
5,Great Truck,Ron ,01/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Great all around truck with plenty of power coming from the revamped Flex Fuel 4.7L coupled to a flawless 5 spd automatic.  Interior very well designed and built with plenty of room to boot.  Town MPG is very good for a V8.,"Flex fuel, powerful 4.7L, smooth strong automatic transmission","Spray in bedliner, Utilitrack bed tiedown system.

4.625,2008 Quad Cab 4.7 Liter,Steve ,01/25/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,I've had the truck for a couple of weeks now and love it.  The new 4.7 liter engine has plenty of power for my needs.  The only negative I have is that I wish mpg was a little better in the city.  But it is a truck so what do you expect.  On the highway I've gotten between 18 and 20 crusing around 65 so that's not too bad.  It seems pretty solid to me and is probably the best buy for the money.  ,I love the looks and that I can fit my family of 6 in it if I have to.,Better gas mileage.
4.875,The reality of hd trucks.,SS ,01/23/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Here it is folks. I run my trucks in the service industry.  I've had Fords, Chevys, and Dodge trucks. I annualy put on 18000 miles per yr on gravel/26000 hwy . If you want reliability(hands down)buy a Dodge diesel. Interior appointments OK but not as nice as Chevys. If you want a nice hiway truck, buy a diesel (expect nickle and dime repairs over 60000 miles lots of them) if you work this truck. Great tranny and motor though.  Fords hum. To each his own but I cannot see me purchasing another Ford in the near future.  ",Dodge trucks have cost me about half in annual repair costs compared to Chevrolet of equivalent build and service.  Cummins economy is 19 mpg- 22mpg hwy about the same as duramax depending on temerature outside. Mega cab room is miles ahead of competition.  Ride is great with about 600-700lbs in back,"Fog lights are easily smashed out by rocks.  Suggest making them out of other material that glass,  on my third set.  Ball joints in front end should be greasable(short lifespan 55000 miles).  Availability of drum breaks in rear instead of disc because of short life with use on gravel-(all brands)"
4.75,Great Basic Truck,Randy-South Carolina ,01/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I recently purchased a bare bones work truck for a third vehicle.  I have owned about every diffent model of truck in the last 20 years and I have to say I am very pleased with this truck.  Dodge has managed to build a simple, very well built work truck that at an acceptional value. The six- speed manual allows for optimum power out of the six cylinder motor and provides good economy. I have averaged approximely 19 mpg round about and over 23 mpg on the highway. To describe this vehicle in a few short words; good price, quiet at high speeds, plenty of power, great fuel economy for a full size truck.  ",The standard cab has plently of usable space behind the seat.  The six speed manual is a great feature that allows for improved fuel economy. Pleanty of cup holders and large door pockets allow for additional storage space.,"Opt for the longer wheel base if possible. The short wheel base is nibble and easy to park, but the suspension is tight, more so than many 4X4's. The short wheel base in conjuntion with the high center of gravity can make this ride almost like a Jeep Wrangler. Bumpy road can be exausting."
4.25,Good truck,OC ,01/10/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,4,4,3,4,"I just got this truck last month but so far, I am very impressed.  This is my 7th truck and my first Dodoge. It is roomy, comfortable and although stiff, I like the ride. (It feels solid like a truck should) Off road in low 4wd, it is a hoss. On the highway in 2wd, it drives very well and is very quiet.",Laramie model has all the bells and whistles. Very comfortable for the whole family.,"Not real sure about the multi displacement engine. Although very smooth, I can tell when the engine cuts back to 4 cylinders. I wish it had an over-ride for folks like me who drive very little and are not that concerned about the gas mileage. "
4.875,Hemi rules the road,Tim-Louisiana ,01/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Great driving truck with secure feel on the road. The interior is as confortable as possible, without leather. 20 inch wheels give it height and attitude.

4.75,It's got a Hemi,Dave ,12/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I purchsed the Dodge during a snow storm and thought I would have to drive very carefully on my way home but with the ESP (electronic stability System), it was almost impossible to get the wheels to break loose.  My kids fight over the front seat because of the heated seat feature.  I really like the styling and you can't beat the power.  ","Heated seats, warranty and styling","Even with the multi displacement system, the truck is getting between 14-15 mpg.  Maybe after it breaks in it will get better"
4.75,Good job on the New Ram,Nice Job Dodge ,11/29/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,I just bought my 08 Ram 4.7 Reg Cab after all owning a GMC crew cab. I have to say this is a great truck. It was nice to see a small V8 have awesome power. Dodge took the 4.7 up to 310HP and in a reg cab with 20's and a five speed Auto this truck can get. The funny thing is I did not know the HP was that nor did my salesman or the dealership. I found it online afterword here in Edmunds. So listen up Dodge you need to Advertise the new power and help out your sales. If you are looking for a new truck but do not want to break the bank. Go buy a new Ram 4.7 with 310HP. I got mine for less than $21000 loaded. It is a great truck and a blast to drive. Get a flowmaster and intake and it comes alive.,"The new 310HP motor. I love all the room behind the seats after getting rid of my 06 GMC Crew lifted 35"". This truck is so much more fun to drive. ",Update the inside dash ect. It has a great heavy tailgate but it needs to be spring loaded like the Toyota. 
4.875,Great Truck,Colorado Ram ,10/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I bought the new 2008 Ram Quad Cab 4x4 with the Hemi. It's a great truck to drive and very fast! On the highway we are getting 18 MPG, not bad since the truck only has 1200 miles as I write this.  Great truck!",Hemi,None
