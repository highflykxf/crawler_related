1,dont buy!,Ysaac ,09/25/2016,1,1,5,,,1,2,1,4,,,"thought it was the best thing next to sliced bread, but what a headache this suv has been! burns oil due to bad engineering of the AFM system, dealer just gives run around, when you force them to repair it will cost you big! maybe even a new engine, read post about this vehicle before you think of buying, mine took a crap at around 110k miles so i was out of luck with warranty...also mpg is really round 16mpg avg. so not worth the extra thousands of dollars diff. from a regular yukon! thats why GM stop making them. got an F150 now, loved my Jimmy but they made me hate it! due to design flaw and lack of support  bye GMC!",,

4.875,No buyer's remorse here!,Tex ,07/31/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After the Hybrid stickers were removed, my family and I stand back and admire the beauty of this automobile.  We had been persuaded away from American-made cars several years ago and went the way of the foreign minivan.  We were leery of Government Motors, but are extremely happy with the quality of this vehicle.   The ride is smooth, the gas mileage is really 20 mpg, and the cargo room is expansive with the last row of seats out.   All our stuff can fit and when the grandparents come to town, everyone has ample room.  GM did a great job without sacrificing anything.  It's solid and the quality is on par with any Toyota/Honda/Nissan minivan out there!  ",MPG and the Navigation system.  Envy from other drivers at stop lights!

5,tremendous vehicle!,jet1 ,06/21/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had my Yukon Hybrid for a year and a half and in that time I have discovered a whole new level of sophistication. Previously I have had Range Rovers which are very nice but just don't offer the same level of performance. I have had one recall for a minor issue but other than that in 19,000 miles it has never missed a beat. Fuel mileage seems to average around 20 mpg mostly city driving, but the carbon foot print of this vehicle is far lower than my last few which is the reason I bought it. At stop lights with the engine off the other hybrids are usually running...enough said. You do have to learn to change your driving style to get the most out of this vehicle.","handling is good, drive line is spectacular. Build quality so far is VERY good as is the performance. Stopping power is also excellent.",the folding second seat needs to have a latch to hold it in place when folded.

The truck was receiving poor gas mileage, but after the transmission recall it is getting what is estimated.  I love the fact it gets around 20 miles per gallon and I have a lead foot.

We're only getting around 17 MPG.  I have a lead foot, but my wife doesn't and she is the primary driver.  Don't see how other reviewers are getting 20+.  Have also had to take it to the dealer twice for brake issues.  Covered under warranty, but still a hassle.  Interior is laid out nicely, but materials seem really cheap.  Driver's seat has great leg and head room, but comfort of seat is lacking on long trips.  Overall, pretty happy with it.  Has a very good ride even at 75-85 MPH.  With 3rd row seats out, cargo area is spacious. Can't use NAV without radio on.","Remote start, XM, NAV, OnStar, leg room, sunroof, MP3 jack, auto folding side mirrors, backup camera","Better fuel economy.  Full power seats (has power back/forth, but manual recline).  Also fold-flat 3rd row seat would be better.  DVD screen blocks most of driver's rear view; screens on front headrests would be better.

In 9 months I have driven over 27,000 miles in both city and highway driving, as well as a short 300 mile trip towing a medium size Uhaul.  Very comfortable on the road and around town.  For a 5,600 lb. SUV with 4WD I can't complain getting 18.5 MPG pulling a trailer at 80 MPH and 19.5 MPG on the open road at 85 MPH.

The result has been about 23 mpg in overall mileage in a 2WD truck that is fun to drive and easy to operate. Highly recommended to those who need and appreciate large trucks.  There is simply nothing else like this truck in its size/weight class.","Remote engine starting from key fob, nav system, backup camera, power folding outside mirrors, on-star cell phone with turn-by-turn nav service, air compressor to inflate tires",optional larger battery pack / 110v plug-in recharge options for longer range on electric motors.
4,2008 Yukon Hybrid,Disappointed ,03/27/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,1,4,"If you are considering this vehicle for the gas mileage, forego the Hybrid and purchase a regular Yukon. Based upon the advertising, I thought that it would be worth spending the extra money for the mpg. It's not. Driving under normal conditions (acceleration and braking), I am averaging just 16 mpg, or less. The sticker on the vehicle said EPA Estimate of 20 City/20 Hwy (However, the fine print says ""16-24 depending upon driving conditions"" (paraphrasing), which give GM a great deal of flexibility, while disappointing the buyer! GM's Hybrid technology is questionable, to say the least. They want you to drive slower than the rest of traffic on start-ups, and brake slower than normal.","Other than the gas mileage, my wife and I love the vehicle. It rides nice, is quiet, and appears to be well built. ","By a regular Yukon. The vehicle does have Hybrid technology, I just don't believe it offsets the additional weight of the battery. If you took a regular Yukon, stripped down the weight similar to a Hybrid, and drove it too slow, and braked to slow, you would get equal or better gas mileage."
5,This is a great SUV,ransom777 ,01/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have owned this car for about a month and just love it. It is quiet, comfortable, and great to drive. I am averaging about 18mpg.

I averaged 23.7 mpg on 400 mile trip home from dealership, driving 65-70 mph on interstates. Am now averaging 24.5 mpg combined city/highway driving in my local area. The hybrid system, and instant economy display really encourage you to drive light-footed, and I have never been light-footed until now. It is a hoot to drive - the hybrid system is virutally seamless in transition, and the V8/V4 cylinder deactivation system works really well. As an added bonus, you can sneak up on your friends and neighbors up to 30 mph, like a big golf cart..","The hybrid system, and how well it works","Lighten the 3rd row seats, and increase the padding in the driver's and front passenger's seats.

I drive back and forth to San Diego from Las Vegas two to three times a month. I bought this car last weekend because of the employee pricing, that did away with the proclaimed ROI that all the web sites said for the price make sense. Wow, what a car! I put over 400 miles on it in town, which would have equated with two tanks in my Expedition. When I did fill it up it was 15.00 cheaper than my Expedition. Right there is a 100 savings in just the first week. The vehicle looks great. The vehicle drives like a dream. Haven't taken it over to SD yet but I'm sure it'll be great","Gas mileage, comfort, looks! The car is really quiet.","The door locks/alarm system is different. Alarm should set with the doors closed. You currently have to lock the care and then shut the door. Not bad, but different. The DVD Screen should be bigger. Third row seats should fold flat (like the Ford) instead I took them out."

I drove with a feather touch, and watched the economy meter regularly. On the hwy, I only used Cruise control for maximum gas mileage. With all my attempts, these are the best numbers I could do. I was so upset (and embarrassed when asked by friends what my mileage was on my new Yukon hybrid), that I sold it at a huge loss.  Better to get it off my back now than later. It'll be worthless in a year, if they even still make it by then.  Interior is all molded plastic... Terrible.  ",built in xm radio.,Any kind of realistic mileage.  They're gastimates are ridiculous.

My new Yukon Hybrid fits our company image perfectly. I now own 2 Cadillac Escalades that average 12 MPG. I have averaged 21.7 MPG over the last 3,000 miles with my new Yukon Hybrid. I love my vehicle! The car cost me $20,000 less than my Escalades and is both quieter and handles better. I plan on purchasing two more for my company as soon as the leases are up on the Escalades.

The hybrid takes some getting used to--it sounds like a golf cart when starting out.  After considerable research, we replaced a 4WD Tahoe and the difference in the mileage is startling and pleasing. We anticipate the difference between the conventional and hybrid will be obliterated in three years or less because of the gas. The interior is comfortable although the seats are harder than the older Tahoe.  We took out the 3rd row of seats (not getting them was not an option)for more storage on trips.
