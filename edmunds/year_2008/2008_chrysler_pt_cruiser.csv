After8 yrs of driving this car, the seats are still super confortable and offer plenty of back support. The back seats are very simple to remove so I can haul an amazing amount of stuff. My gas milage seemed to improve substantially after I broke in the engine over time. I've gotten as high as 26mpg hwy and as low as 19. I thought this car was a tin can in the beginning and considered it to be a temporary car for me, but to my surprize...it's really held up pretty well for such an inexpensive car.Cons:  I've had to replace the cam shaft, hub bearings, clutch, now the airconditioning compressor is making noise. They tell me the timing belt is next to go. I suppose this is all normal wear and tear?",,

The ride quality seems to be decent...very little harshness from wind noise or uneven road surfaces.

Also overheats when in idle a lot the dealership tells me its the engine cooling fan module thank god I bought the extended warranty on it. The module cost over 400 dollars plus labor.

I bought mine slightly used (it has 1800 miles on it in the same model year) and I use it as my daily driver as well as for many of my family's long trips and it handles the interstate and in-town driving well.

Also it's the Touring model which includes a nicer interior and more standard content including nice alloys.

If the wife's happy everyone is happy.","Seems to have a lot of neat features for such an inexpensive vehicle: trip computer, power everything, cd, we like the dash displays. Lot of storage in a small package. Her edlerly mother loves the grab handle on the passenger side dash.","A bit more power, a bit better gas mileage (she's averaging 22 MPG with about 20% hwy). 5 or 6 speed transmission.

It's been great around town for me,the kids and all of our stuff - we're a busy family and I really enjoy the roominess of the cargo area.  For the dog, I can fold the back seats up for even more room.  The only drawback is the surprising low gas mileage for the base engine, because it's not quick.

This ranges from mild to severe with severe being when the dash lights flicker too and then they both blip out and then back on again.
