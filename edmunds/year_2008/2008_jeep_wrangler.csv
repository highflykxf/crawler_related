5,Great vehicle!!!,Steve ,11/20/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,4 door Jeep Sahara has been an incredible vehicle for us. Only reason we are getting rid of it is that we need more room for the family. Other wise we would not part with it,,
1,Consumer Reports was correct,A ,09/19/2016,1,1,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,"I ignored the fact that consumer reports rated this year jeep the worst they have ever rated a car in all their years of testing.  It burns oil from the day it was purchased. Tons of electrical problems. Crysler refused a recall even though this was a huge problem for many. Jeep engine is too small and can't get out of its way. As far as stability Google ""death wobble "". You'll thank me.",,
1,If you hate yourself...Buy One!,Jeff Murray ,07/14/2016,1,1,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,Least comfortable automobile I've ever owned. Added candles to the front the headlights were so bad. Rusting inside out. Never been offroad. Piece of crap!,,
5,Simply AWESOME!,Anthony ,05/06/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I would have to say this is the best vehicle I have ever owned. Rubicon lives up to its hype.... best in comfort, handling, and looks great! Theres not much you cant do with the Rubicon... love the lockers for the front and rear. My whole family loves this vehicle.... I will never own anything other than a Rubicon!!",,
5,Bought mine and am having fun Modding it,Deserteagle ,03/07/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"My wife and I are new empty nesters so I thought it would be fun to own something not as practical as the usual SUV. My wife was completely against it since she loved the other SUV but I talked her into it and it's good that I did. Her Honda Civic seemed to have developed a crack in the engine block the week I bought this and she had to drive the Jeep while her car was getting a free engine from Honda. During the two weeks it had dumped about 2 feet of snow and she hadn't driven a manual that much in her life so for the first couple of days she really, really didn't like this Jeep and was very vocal about it. After that she started to like it and after her car was done I had to bribe her and pry the keys from her hands (she literally has a grip of a ninja!). The Jeep was used but in incredible shape with only 60K on it. The previous owner had put on a 2k winch front bumper,lights, side bars, 33 inch tires, 4 inch lift, nice winch and many many other custom parts. He also Rino coated the whole under carriage. I asked the dealer if it was possible for me to talk to him and they made it happen. Apparently him and his new wife were having a baby and she put her foot down and demanded a more responsible SUV for the family than the Jeep. He never took it off road and basically just liked to customize it. He said he put about 6k worth of stuff on it and was surprised I got it so cheap from the dealership. He looked sad to see it again actually. We've had it for about a year now and I've spent about 3k more on customized parts for it. I've had it off road for hunting and whatnot but not anything serious because I learned it takes all day to clean the thing after taking it mudding. After the 16 vehicles I've had in my life this is my favorite. It gets good mileage for what it is in town going to work, has plenty of room for the trips to Sam's Club and Home Depot, turns heads where ever it goes and is fun in the summer with the top off. It's very comfortable to drive for a 6'2 guy but also my wife who is 5'5. The only problem so far is fighting over who gets to drive it now. I would buy one again but to be honest I don't see us getting rid of this one unless some meat head wreaks into it or it get's stolen.",,
2,Never will buy a Jeep again,Tammy ,02/08/2016,17,2,4,,,1,1,1,4,,,"I have contemplated on buying a jeep for many months since I have a 5 mth old and I'm a huge chevy girl. Since I live in Michigan we get alot of snow where I am. I heard a jeep is the way to go.  I test drove unlimted and rubicons 4 dr brands cuz that's the style I liked narrowed it down to a sahara unlimited since the rubicon felt like it bounced around way too much. I seen one at a dealership test drove it quickly because they were closing in an hr. I bought it that night drove it next morning to work it shook so bad end up needing a right caliper, brakes and rotors. They fixed for free but I don't trust it at all still feels like it bounces all over the place god forbid if i hit a small bump in the road and i get scared if i go faster then 60 in it so no highway driving for me. Cannot wait to pay this piece of crap off and buy me a chevy product.",,

I drive no higher then 70 on the highway but its usually 60-65. I accelerate at a reasonable pace. I plan on gettingg a little commuter car so i can make this jeep lastI absolutely love it,,
2,Total piece of junk!,coggin ,11/04/2015,1,1,1,,,3,1,1,1,,,"This car is great in the snow, and that is about it.  Also, I learned a great deal about working on cars while living with this piece of crap.  At 30k the clutch went out.  I have had manual for 30 years and this is my first clutch repair.  Gas tank spews out gas if you try to fill it. Death wobble at 35k due to a ""broken"" steering stabilizer.  Front hood latches allow hood to shake whenever trucks go by.  Rear gate latches went at 60k.  Coolant leak water pump replacement at 50k.  Tow package was defective and replaced because of a recall.  Acceleration is on par with my 1981 VW Vanagon.  Headlights are really poor and the brights don't blind anyone. Torx bits are a bit problematic.  Dash rattles and squeaks constantly.  The antenna whips the windshield when trucks go by or if there is a big wind or brush.  The tires that came with the jeep, were done by 35k and were crap when new.  Burns plenty of oil.

4,Waa waa waa!,ranchez ,03/12/2014,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I've had my 2008 Jeep since it was new and love it. I see a lot of complaints here about comfort, noise, ride and acceleration. All I can say is that maybe they thought they were buying an Escalade. You don't buy a Wrangler for luxury, zero-road-noise, or racing from the light. You buy it to take on any off-road terrain you throw at it and crawl through the ick that would sink an Escalade to its axles. You also buy it to pull out the idiots who buy the other ""SUVs"" and try to drive them like a Jeep. Maybe you should sell your Jeep to someone who knows what it is and go buy a quiet, squishy little soccer-parent wagon.","Open air driving. Growly, low gear, super-crawler performance.

I had the repair made in September of 2009 at 52k miles when the airbag light came on.

Though the Grand Cherokee rides and drives better, the performance between the two is comparable. I overall average 23 MPG with mostly highway driving and the 6- speed manual transmission.

It is a good off road vehicle, if that is what you are looking for. I have had Jeeps before and this one was an improvement in areas like ride and interior comfort. Keep in mind that even with the longer wheelbase, the ride is still that of a Jeep. It is a lot of work to take it on a trip of 300 miles of more. It is affected by small amounts of wind and the interior is noisy. Not recommended by me. ","Navigation, remote starter, and trade in value. Some how they do retain their value very well.

Smooth ride with great turning circle. Freedom top, infinity sound system.",I like it maybe more engine power but it is a utility vehicle.
4.625,My first Jeep!,Asartain29 ,01/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I have wanted a  Wrangler for a long time, and I finally purchased one in Feb. 2008.  It is a 2008 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 2DR, steel blue metallic in color, BF Goodrich Mud Tires, Infinity sound system, satellite radio, wanted manual transmission but went with automatic.  I have owned my jeep for almost a year and I love it.  Have had no problems, and it is off-road all the time. It is a beast off-road, and is impossible to get stuck.  I have went up inclines that would make most people urinate on themselves, and she has never once slipped.  I have only had to use 4low twice. I am going to drive my jeep until the wheels fall off.  I love having the top down, and the doors off. Buy One","Sound system, handling on and off- road, the way she will go through and over anything, Mud tires that come standard on Rubicons, more quite than jeeps of the past, really my favorite features are everything about it.","My on complaint is, like most other people, gas mileage."
4.25,Enjoying the Jeep,BTM449 ,12/24/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,3,4,3,5,"This was the first American car purchased in the last 20 year. Along with the Jeep, I own an 08 Acura MDX, 04 BMW 3-Series convertible, and an 06 BMW 5-Series. The Jeep is exactly what I expected; the complete opposite of these vehicles. It drives like a truck and has minimal luxury features. You either love it or hate it... And after the first extreme snow storm here in New England, I love it. The Jeep does exactly what it is supposed to do. The 4-wheel-drive plows though and makes you feel quite safe even though you do not have a lot surrounding you.  There is not a lot of power, cannot accelerate quickly, but you can get yourself unstuck.  Excellent quality and value (so far). BUY JEEP ","Definitely opt for the power options (remote key-less entry, power windows). The sound system is also decent and has a pretty good sized sub woofer in the back.   Sahara Pkg.-- The different suspension makes it smoother on road.",Move the power window buttons... They are awkwardly placed in the center console.  More power! Power soft top would be pretty cool. 
4.375,"So far, so good",CCJ ,12/07/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"My third Wrangler. This one is best by leaps and bounds.  Power is adequate for highway use, but another 40 hp would be welcome. Handling is much better than earlier iterations.  I bought an X with the 24S option package. Adding the Limited Slip rear axle, rock rails, extra skid plates and the Freedom Top.  To date, I've had no issues of consequence. A minor, but annoying rattle in the driver's side. A pillar was traced to an over-tightened screw in the plastic trim that stripped out the plastic. Going up one size fixed that. A minor rain leak between the halves of the top was corrected by cleaning the sealing area and silicon treating the seals.  18/25 mileage so far.  I love this beast.",No other vehicle offers as much customization and after-market hardware. It's easy and inexpensive to personalize or configure for insane off-road adventures. You can leave it absolutely stock and know that you still own one of the most capable factory built off-road vehicles on the market.,More power. Improve the hard top design (too many reports of leaks).  Add a front skid plate to protect the steering damper and sway bar disco electronics. A Dana 44 front axle should be optional on the X model. Hood hold down rubbers: they get weak with age and the hood can flutter at speed.

Katzkin leather seats with suede in the middle and a 368w 7-speaker infinity sound sys incl subwoofer with Sirius satellite radio... Remote starter... A bought it from the dealer like this and got a real good deal... The rake is beautiful... It stands tall... Looks and is tough... In short a show stopper... I love my Jeep! Buy American!

And sway bar disconnect we have all the offroad guts we need  without geting the more spendy Rubicon. Also Jeeps are for the most part made in the USA and by not retooling design every year are more eco friendly and less expensive.

I'm very impressed with the ride, handling, quality and surprisingly, the gas mileage.  The interior ergonomics are very weak, it's like no one actually sat in one before okaying it for production.  So far I've had 2 odd occurrences: A one time puddle of gear oil under the rear end and I was driving down the highway and the dash lights came on, the windshield wipers wiped once and it never happened again.  Summary: I love it ","Overall style, nice ride and handling, adequate performance, decent fuel economy for a brick, A good value.",Upper edge of door panel is too square and digs into my elbow! Couldn't they have rounded it off a little?  Very odd location of Overdrive button. Why isn't it on the shifter?!?  Where's the ashtray to stash little items?  Why no map pockets in the rear doors?

The X with the power pack is darn close to the Sahara without paying the Sahara price. Get the hard top 3 piece. No leaks, yet. Gas mileage is ok 18.5 avg. I'm going to put a cold air intake and spacer to improve fuel consumption. Its fun to drive looks great and can go anywhere offroad i need it to go. Plenty of room in the back seat and cargo area. The stereo rocks. Those who want more zoom should by a car, hello it's a Jeep",Love the 6 speed stick and the stereo. V6 is great too. 3 piece hard top is the best feature. The good ride was unexpected. Drove it 200+ miles home from the dealer and was pleasantly surprised.   ,4.0!

That Cherokee has 150k on it and still runs like a champ! It also influenced my decision on purchasing this new one i got. It's just awesome off the road.,the freedom top is cool. Off road handling is very good. The YES fabric on the inside is very good & easy to clean if you have kids or you're just dirty. All around good vehicle,"The 3 pc hard top that needs to be perfectly aligned when being put back on.

I only have 2000 miles on it so far and can't really comment on reliability (been great so far!). Otherwise I love it!  Design gets all 10s from me -- from the outside in, it's a Jeep!  And the drivetrain seems to be as solid as they claim.  Love the freedom tops.  Sound system is much better than older Wranglers.  Road noise with the hard top is not bad, which surprised me.  Handles well on highway at 80+ MPH, which is also surprising (though it wanders a bit).  I'm a big guy, and interior is very comfortable for me.  Fuel economy? I gave it a 10 because it meets my expectations. It's a Jeep, not a Toyota.","Appearance, ground clearance, MyGig/Nav (tho MP3 needs improvement), Freedom Tops, 4-doors, suspension. Hmmm, everything except below.","Two things come to mind:  I would have paid more for a V8 or a Hemi, no question.  No option, though.  The MyGig MP3 player interface needs tweaking.

5,We've come home,Todd L ,10/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We rented a Jeep Wrangler X when we were vacationing in Maui and came home and bought one.  We had owned a CJ5 about 20 years ago before we started having kids.  We had so much fun with the Wrangler on the Road to Hana as it took every curve and hill with ease that it reminded us just what we loved about having a jeep.  This one definitely has a better heater/AC than the CJ (thank goodness)  and handles great.  All we own if 4x4's but the jeep handles so much better than our trucks.  Thanks goodness we rented one and rediscovered what a joy it is.,The handling and the fun of the ragtop.  The quick turning and stability.,The passenger seat needs to be more like the old CJs so it will allow the passengers to get into the rear seat easier. The old design was much better.

I added rock rails to protect the underside of the body's rocker area. Options include the wonderful Freedom top, automatic transmission, Sirius radio, Side air bags and fog lights.  Compared to the previous iterations of the Wrangler, the new JK series is vastly better in terms of quiet and ride isolation. If you've own an older Wrangler, you will be astounded at the refinement of the JK inside and out, on road and off road.  Fuel mileage around town is 16 mpg, while getting a surprising 25+ mpg highway.",Owning a Wrangler is really a lifestyle. The Wrangler is adaptable to any weather and driving conditions. Go anywhere and have fun doing it.

I've owned previous wranglers, but since they stopped making the Sport, my only option that was similar was the X Model.  I must concur with the other person who rated this vehicle.  I definitely notice the difference between the 4.0 and 3.8.  The Jeep is perfect except for the power! Fuel economy will never be good for a Jeep, but theres a give and take.  It is very slow starting out, and the six speed manual forces you to change gears more often, at slower speeds.  I do hope they go back to the 4.0 liter, and I'm sure I will upgrade to the newer model if they did this.  I wouldn't be able to switch out the motor on my own, because of the warranty","The new body style is definitely awesome, large tires and ground clearance as well.  Additionally the lifetime powertrain warranty is a good thing, because I'm sure that 3.8 wouldn't last a lifetime.  This only vehicle that looks better than this jeep is the Rubicon (also 3.8).","More power absolutely.  Its just slow with the 3.8.  My previous 2004 was just fine with a 4.0.  The interior is missing that nice compartment in front of the shifter where you could put change, and the cup holders kind of suck.  The entire cup holder, armrest module should be a little larger."

This Jeep could have more get up and go. I have the six speed manual and when it's cold out it jumps out of second gear all the time.

I have contacted my local dealer 9 times now without any luck.  I have just filed a complaint with Chrysler which I hope will bring results.  The workmanship is poor as well as their service apparently.  ,Looked cool before the rust.  ,Use a higher quality paint.  Improve the service team.
4.25,Finally got my Jeep,rapsoda65 ,03/13/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,4,4,3,5,"Wanted a Jeep CJ back in the day, got married and never got one. Now she's gone and I got my Jeep. Most fun I've ever had in a car. 2 weeks ago took it out with the top down for the first time, can't wait for summer. Comfy ride for a Jeep.  Handles better than I expected for an SUV, and this is not my first SUV.  Gas mileage is about what EPA rating says it is. Looks good outside and in, but interior needs a little work. Odd placement of window cranks and center dash console has too sharp an edge at the drivers knee. Center arm rest could be higher.  Seating position and seats are comfortable.  ","Top down driving with the soft top. Doesn't leak, even in a car wash. Seating position is upright, very nice seats. Fun to drive with manual tranny, always easy to find the right gear.  Extremely cool with top off, stand-out vehicle driving down the road. Off road legend is well deserved.","Positioning of window cranks and center dash stack is right at the drivers knees. Could use a bit more power. Top could be easier to put down and a lot easier to put up. Center storage/ arm rest could be positioned a little higher. Better drip edge on soft top, rain drips in when doors are opened."
4.375,I'm Happy With It..,BBK ,03/09/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,3,4,4,5,"This is my first Jeep, although I have owned other 4wd vehicles. This 4 wheel drive system is the best I have had, other have included Ford, Chevy and Toyota. I have the 6 speed manual tranny, I shift quickly and am easy on the gas and average 20.7 MPG (both highway and city). I have the hardtop with the removable sections over the driver and passenger. No leaks after removing them a few times and reinstalling. Open the door in the rain though and you will get a stream of water in the truck as water follows the gap in front and into the vehicle rather than down the glass on a closed front door. Ride is good up front but in the back you sit on the axle making it bumpy. It is what it is. ","You could roast a marshmallow on the heater vents, they crank. Brakes work great, handling is nice. The 4 wheel drive system is the best.  ",Levers to open the side windows in the rear of the vehicle.

The dealership had to replace the motor at 1664 miles, put on a new alternator at 1700 miles and it has been in the shop for a week this time waiting for a new power steering pump. Every time I drive it in snow deeper than 6/8 inches deep the fan belt comes off which then causes the power steering fluid to spray all over the engine compartment. Now when I use the heater I have to open a window to get rid of the burnt power steering fluid smell so it doesn't make me sick. I haven't even taken it 4 wheeling yet. These are definitly not the Jeeps they used to be. Don't buy one.",I like the ride and comfort and handling(when its running). It's actually a fun vehicle to drive. Also the heater works a 100% better than they used to.,Put a different motor in it and design a skid plate that will keep snow for getting into the engine compartment. Also the smog canister is exposed in front of the back axle(why did they put it there?)and it needs a skid plate.

Steering is light but responsive, corners well and the highway ride is much improved over past generations. Noise is still there but not dominating. Engine isn't a powerhouse but with the 6 spd that's up to the driver, and it can go fairly well. No problems with the roof or door seals. Suspension is firm but in town it doesn't have a problem absorbing northern Alberta potholes. If you want a cushy ride, buy a Crown Vic. I plan to have this thing for a long time, and so far so good! ","Good seats, decent outward visibility, great tires and rims and (with hard top) handles northern Canadian winters quite well. Pay the extra for the infinity sound system w/ sub!","Squeeze a little more power outta the engine bay (maybe a diesel?), charge less for the MyGig (i can buy the same features individually in stores for a fraction of the cost).

No issues with water leakage.",Handling quality is superb. Sound system crisp and clean. Dash layout very ergonomic. Engine quiet. ,More power in the engine. A 5th gear in the automatic.

Easy to use soft top, fantastic go-most places, great turning circle and handling make it a fun, fun, fun car. Only downside is after a few months you feel it would be even better with at least a five or six speed auto. No I dont want a manual thank you. Ratio between third and top is to wide.

I had a salesman who told me that I was buying a fun vehicle that would keep me smiling and enjoying the outdoors and the kids would never want to get out of it. It was not for commuting or long trips. He told me it would be noisy on the highway because of the flat front and box design, it would be bouncy and not great on gas mileage. He has been right on all fronts. I did not go out to buy an economy car, a smooth ride or fancy interior. Thats not what Jeep is offering.","Very pleased with the seats, around town driving is smooth and the engine is quit(I have the standard. Height of Jeep (kids love sitting up high).

My friend had one in high school back in the midwest and we used to mud every weekend and it would never stall in the water. Then he got a stinking Toyota and you couldn't go through six inches of water before it stalled. I love mine so far. I have only put a hundred miles on it, but it rides amazing. I am taking it up to the Sierras this weekend to check out the off roading. The only bad part is it is so nice I don't want to get it dirty. It is nice to own a piece of American History.

First of all, the hard tops do not leak if you put them on properly. The most important thing is putting the panels on in the right order and tightening from side to side until both anchors are tight...nuff said. This vehicle can maneuver, brake, corner, and is very smooth. What other vehicle on the market looks cool, has one of the highest resale values, is a great 4WD, it's convertible, virtually waterproof, and is practical and fun to drive?

Gas mileage is 16-17 with most being around town so far. The hard top works well with no leaks so far and I've been out in quite a bit of rain. My only true concern is how underpowered the engine is.

I find it to be the most solid built vehicle I have ever owned, and I have owned many SUV's in the past ten years.

Because of the low gearing of the transmission you must be ready to take off when the light turns green. This is were more power is needed without question. Love the seats which are curved like sport seats to hold you in place.,Standard radio in the Sahara biggest and best suprised. Fog lights are a must.,Transmission makes strange noises when shifting from 1st to 2nd. Brought back to dealer ordered a new clutch assembly (found out I was not the only one complaining.)

The engine on this model is significantly more quiet and has better pick up and gas mileage than my previous models. The additional 6"" of length and width also make the new model much more comfortable to drive on the highway. I got the 2dr Sahara with the MyGig Navigation and the Power Group (windows and locks). The MyGig is awesome, loaded 2GB worth of music. The new softtop is cool because you can fold back the portion over the front seat without having to remove the entire top.

Not as luxurious as my 2003 Suburban Z71, but I didn't order it with that expectation. It actually came darn close. Who wants leather and plush seats in a convertible that is expected to get wet. Can't do that with my Suburban. Simply put, we love it and it is a better ride than a 2001 Cherokee and larger than one. The new Jeep is so quiet you cannot even hear or feel the engine idle or shift up or down when driving.

I have 2500 miles on my 2 Dr Sahara so far and it is rock solid. No squeaks, rattles, in fact the ride is nothing short of spectacular for a vehicle with it's suspension type and the short wheelbase. Sure, it's not Lexus quiet, but that's not what you're buying.  There is high speed wind noise and you arent going to win any road races, but that shouldn't be expected here.","It's a Jeep - not a Honda, or a Kia, or a Toyota.

Add to that, topless driving and that it will easily climb a wall and you have a winner!","As in every case with trucks - a more powerful, fuel efficient engine would be nice; the interior center stack covering materials could stand to be upgraded; lots of unused space on the shifter hump that should be converted into storage. How about a ""manlier"" shift handle - maybe with a Jeep logo?"
5,Beyond pleased!,Rickxjeeps ,11/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We've had 13 Jeeps between the two of us in our lifetime. From a 77 Cherokee to the most current model year, an 02 Grand Cherokee Limited. Retiring a 93 Wrangler that was my daily driver for the last 13 years for this model and we both are extremely pleased! The ride is impecably smooth even for a Wrangler but so much more car like. It is so quiet you forget your in a Hardtop, unlike the 93 Wrangler with the hardtop. People had trouble hearing me on the cell phone. Unlike the 4.0 in the 93 which could be heard easily, you can't hear the 3.8 motor and you forget you have it running. Factory remote start rocks! Opt for it, it's worth it! It's 10.5 inches bigger than an 08 Liberty!","The remote start rocks! The amount of room is incredible! Jeep specs say it's 10.5 inches larger than a Liberty! The incredibly smooth ride. To those who complain about the seat quality, Sit in any previous Wrangler! Seats that are exposed to the outside are not supposed to be plush or leather.",None!
4.75,Love my Jeep,Rick ,11/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,I love my Jeep.  Looks great. Drives great.  Much more room than I ever anticipated.  Cannot recomend it more.,,
4.25,I got my Jeep back!,ownedseveral ,10/28/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,4,3,3,5,"I have owned several Jeeps. A 94 Cherokee and 97 TJ Wrangler. After a brief and dull experience with a Chrysler Town and Country minivan, I got my Jeep back. Yes, everything about the Jeep is, well, Jeepish. I have the hard top model so wind noise is not that much of a big deal and I like the fact that I can take the front panels off on a nice day. They are light and easy. On a rainy day I have seen the top leak once and after reseating it not more leaks.  I have the manual 6 speed so power is not that much of an issue. Get the power and door lock option if you have a child. My wife hates that we did not get this option. ",Fun factor. You can strip everything off on a nice day and hit the trails. I like being part of the Jeep family and most members will help you out with anything.,Engine power. Hard top needs improvement in the rain. When the door is opened the rain is channeled right into the interior. 
3.75,Back In A Jeep Again,backinajeepagain ,10/02/2007,,,4,5,3,4,,3,4,2,5,"Drives smooth, quiet, tracks straight, handles great for SUV. Getting actual 18.5-21mpg. Roomy for my 6'3"" frame. Hard & Soft tops are much better quality. Trans shifts smooth, quick, and hardly noticeable. Very fun to drive. 3500 miles in 5 weeks, doors off 4 times. Love the room of the 4 door. You wouldn't be afraid to drive this to a black tie event. Gets lots of looks and questions. The electronic throttle is diferent,. takes a little getting used to. Could use more power. Mopar needs to offer post style mirrors that go in top hinge when doors are off, got mine off the internet. Really enjoying the amenities cruise, a/c, elec wdws, pwr locks, 6 disc, sirius. I drive 30K+ per yr. ","Having both tops. Freedom hardtop with its removable panels. The look of the vehicle is great, they got the ""rake"" stance right. 6 disc nice upgrade. 18"" wheels. Easily removed doors. Ride and handling. Quiet ride. Tow pkg. Elec doors, windows, cruise, standard A/C.",More power. Joint creak between left doors. Needs better storage space. Sun visors need upgrading. Door jamb trim pieces poor fit/finish. Put OD/off button on shifter. Cruise back on steering wheel. Mopar needs mirrors that go in top hinge when doors are off. Adjustable lumbar suport. Adjustable remote mirrors 
4.625,An Amazing Ride,DJ Bill ,09/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"This is my first Jeep. I have never even ridden in one let alone owned one. I have heard so much about them and all the stories were true. It is super fun to drive and with all the configurations of the top and windows, there is no limit to the look and feel of driving this vehicle. I previously owned a 2004 Durango and the gas mileage on this was horrible. I am currently getting 19.4 mpg in my new Jeep and very satisfied with that. Pulling up to red lights is interesting because everyone wants to know about it and other Jeep owners ask ""So, how do you like it?"" I say awesome baby! Just remember these things are built for power, not speed! No need for a radar detector!",This is still a truck but a convertable as well. The best of both worlds! I love experimenting with the windows and top. The new Sunrider Soft Top is an excellent upgrade!,"Would it be a dumb question to ask why they don't make these front wheel drive? I guess it is better to have rear wheel drive for ""pushing"" the Jeep up on the rocks when off-roading. Can't want to experience my first time!"
4.5,Fun to drive,L Lucas ,09/19/2007,,,3,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This is a very fun vehicle to drive. Gets lots of looks, so be prepared to be asked questions, primarily how much they cost. I guess people think they cost a lot more that they do which makes it a value in itself. The only thing I have to remark on is the position of the arm rest, both on the door and the console. I am 5'8"", so not abnormal in height for a woman....the center console is pretty low and there is no arm rest on the door. However, keeping in mind that this is not a luxury car and not bought for comfort, I really can't complain. Love it, love it, love it and really happy with the Jeep!","Looks very rugged, even the 4x2 model, yet elegantly chic!",Give more elbow room!
