1,Timed out in LG,D.Bisner ,01/15/2016,,1,5,,,1,1,5,5,,,"I have had numerous electronic issues with my sport, and at 50,000 miles I got an engine ticking.  In Dec 2014 the timing chains and tensioners were replaced.  within a week the catalytic converter had to be replaced.  A couple months later the shifter assy.  I now need an ECM, and the timing chains have stretched again.  I am told it is unsafe to drive, with no permanent fix, so GM will not do again.  I got under 10,000 miles on the repair to which I paid the GM ""Loyalty"" deductible to have done.   We have purchased 6 GM vehicles, 5 from the same dealership, and the only thing we are being offered is ""great rebates"" on a brand new GM product, and $3000 for our trouble.  I have gotten a couple other opinions who are second guessing the quality of the repair, and need to pull the engine and transmission to change the timing chains.    Update:  I paid out of pocket for the ECM, numerous sensors that have gone bad, and $2,400 to replace the timing chains, now for the second time.  Within a week I broke down, and had to be towed back to the dealer, who said I had a lot of gunk in my engine from poor quality oil.  ALL of my oil changes are done at the dealership.  They did not call me to advise repair process, instead 1 phone call that it was repaired, and I owed them $889.00!  For my next oil change I went to an independent repair shop, who found that the dealer never removed my dip stick when putting the oil pan back on, which bent the dip stick, and it could not be removed.  I then had to pay for that repair, and a  new dip stick/tube assembly.   NOTHING ABOUT THAT IS OK!  The dealer said they cannot help me since I had the work done elsewhere.  I ask you, what could they possibly have done for me in this situation that would make anything that has happened better, and how much would they charge me for that repair!?!  I am done with any GM product, EVER.!! I will NEVER purchase another GM vehicle, just because of the way I have been treated, lied to, and charged for things that I should NEVER have had to pay for.  Shame on you GM, I have been loyal to you for 30 years, and you treat me like this!?   You do not deserve my business.",,

It had performance tires great for speed but not for winters in the Midwest. I have not had any problems with this SUV. I have driven it for more than 11hrs straight just gasing up and bathroom breaks. No issues at all. Transmission shifts effotlessly, no heating up. I have nothing to say about this gem. I bought it with 65k and now have 122k. Regular oil changes a must . Every month I am driving to a different state . Milwaukee to Chicago. Then Kentucky, Virginia, Buffalo, Oklahoma and back to Chicago and Milwaukee. No problem. I really don't see what issues people have . Either I was blessed with a great vehicle and know how to maintain it. Or just some people don't know how to take care and just wreck great vehicles.

It's great for driving on dirt roads, has done well in snow, has good acceleration, good mileage (on a full tank, I was able to drive from Albuquerque to Flagstaff and still have somewhat more than a quarter tank), and the cargo space is great.

Also have a big issue with when you replace the brakes you have to replace the whole thing. It would be fine if it was rare but you have to do this every 40k miles approximately.

I thought it would be o.k. to buy a FWD instead of an AWD. I was wrong and so was my salesman.  He didn't think I would have a problem.  Obviously he didn't know what he was talking about. I won't buy another car from Superior Chevrolet.  After making attempts to get some kind of resolution I was unsuccessful.  ,"3500 lb towing, although I have only towed 1000 lb with it.",Don't offer the FWD in any environment where snow is expected.

I also had to have my ac panel changed because of peeling and now I'm awaiting a passenger door lock controller and a front right head light. It makes me wonder how much I'm going to have to spend after the 2 YEAR warranty if I will have to bear these frequent visits to the garage without even being in an accident and owning a new car. I would suggest a different car. I'm think of the new Audi cross over Hyundia. By the way I hate the unsteady cup holders an cheap old fashion ac vents.,,

I ended up buying the equinox. Its actually wider than the torrent and the front ends are different.  We recently drove it to fla for a Cruise and it was a wonderful ride verses the kia.  Only bad thing is the stupid plastic cup holders... And no where to lay your phone or smokes but I fixed that problem easily. I bought a small office wire basket at walmart and put it on the dash, now I have space to stash a lot.  The radio is great but the speakers arent as good as I had in my kia...  But overall I give this suv a 10!  ",My favorite feature is the sunroof and Cruise... Heated leather seats.,Change cup holders and speakers. Better yet recall these 2 items 
5,Love It,dvilla57 ,06/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I traded my Impala for the Equinox because we were going on a road trip and wanted more room.  The Equinox has that.  We traveled from Texas to Califoria and back without a hitch.  Gas mileage is good.  Lots of leg room.  I like the sporty look of the Equinox even though it is not the sport model.  The position of the windo controls took a little getting used to.  All in all I would recommend this vehicle.,"Leg room, radio controls on the steering wheel, message center",I am not crazy about the console in the middle with the one cup holder.

4.125,Even I was surprised!,pmm texas ,05/03/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,5,4,4,4,"I was skeptical of the reviews of the Equinox from this website. I debated between the Trailblazer and Equinox, but under pressure to trade my very undesirable Honda CRV, I took the plunge and bought the Equinox. I've had it now for 16 months and 22k miles. This car beats the CRV hands down.  It is much more comfortable, has more power, has a smoother ride, roomier, much quieter, and the gas mileage is actually comparable. Glad I traded the CRV and didn't get the Trailblazer. Problems: I've had to replace two batteries and the radio (all under warranty). I don't know why the batteries are being discharged prematurely. ","Highway mileage around 23-24 mpg. Quiet, smooth, comfortable ride. Crash Safety ratings are excellent. Roomy backseat, which slides forward to hold more cargo when necessary. Electronic info center. ","The cup holders are lousy, as previously reported. I dislike the appearance of the hood, grille, and lights, could use a facelift. Disturbing blind spots from front pillars. Front console not quite design right. Tends to fill with stuff and be hidden by arm rest."

Fortunately we both loved the Equinox with its style, safety rating, and overall flexibility. My wife could no longer fit into her Ford Escort and she absolutely loves the new Equinox. Our baby boy also seems to like it, spending long car rides sleeping in the rear seat. The cup holders are ok, and the window controls take a little getting used to (location).

Kid protector on the rear of the passenger seat. Looks sharp, not like every other car on the road today.","A tighter turning radius, although it is not terrible. A larger cargo area.

4,Great All Around ,HollyB ,04/02/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like this car.  It's very roomy and quiet on the road with a lot of features not available on the competition. I have the mid-grade LT1, front wheel drive model. It's easy to see out of fore and aft, so driving, parking and backing up is easy.  The gas mileage is great; I have been averaging over 20 city/hiway and it only requires regular gas. Given I have only the mid level model; it doesn't drive sporty but is pretty agile.  However, it can feel tipsy in very windy driving conditions, which makes the steering feel a too light.  Upgraded models might mitigate this. Lastly, while the seats are comfy, they are a bit too soft on long drives.","Although not great sounding, the stereo as well as HVAC is easy to use and quickly cools/heats car; lit steering wheel controls are nice as is the on board computer showing miles to empty, tire pressure, etc. Lots of room for luggage and back seat passengers; good gas mileage. ","This is nit-picky but could be a deal breaker for some...the cup holder is too low down on the floor; it's a reach for your coffee and there is ONLY 1!

It is such a cute, roomy SUV for my family and I. I can't wait to take it on a road trip and see how well it does. I love how much lower to the ground this vehicle sits, it makes getting kids in and out easy. There is a ton of leg room in the back, even when my 6' hubby is driving. The sliding back seat is great, along with the 'purse cubby' under the front center console. A very basic vehicle, but still enough extra little things to set it apart. What really caught my attention was the crash test ratings.

I don't blame this on Chevy because these things happen. For those of you with a ""noisy engine"" I suggest taking it in.

4.25,Equinox LTZ Experience,Bill ,02/08/2009,,,3,4,4,5,,5,5,3,5,"This vehicle is fun to drive and is quite comfortable. Has decent power and handling. Love the colour (Granite Gray Metallic), yet the interior tends to be somewhat spartan (typical chevy, although I see the 2010 model improves dramatically upon that).  Turning radius is too large, and the usual issue with the cup holders is a hindrance and they are also somewhat flimsy.  Back seat a model of versatility, as it moves 8"" fore and aft to accommodate either passengers or cargo. I do like the height of the rear liftgate, although shorter persons may find it tough to reach.  Overall a fine vehicle - and the AWD feature works well in Chicago area winters. Upgraded Pioneer stereo is rad!","AWD! Great size and room for the money and for it's class. Seats are comfortable and visibility is decent. Exterior trim on the LTZ is quite good - and it is well put together. Definitely get the factory installed remote starter, when available. It is a really nice feature for SUV at this price.","Fix the cupholders. They are in the way of the parking brake lever, and also it is difficult to reach the power seat controls on the drivers side.

The Equinox has more than enough power, and for tall or bigger person is is ideal. After much researching for almost a year, this car is extremely safe and puts the mind at ease with safety. We have a big truck, and didn't want to sacrifice room and power for great gas mileage of a car. Although I wish I had gone with the LS, this is my only regret. This base model has more than enough gadgets and the OnStar is wonderful. I work night shift and live in the country, and after a serious accident about a year ago I am so comfortable driving in the snowy conditions on back roads. With only the FWD, I have never had a problem!","OnStar GPS. All I can say is wow! And for only $10/mo subscription it blows my Garmin out of the water! I got a remote start installed from the dealer, and it takes almost no time at all to get into a toasty car! The V6 power and get-up. The best is the enormous amount of back seat room!","For the price i paid with the wonderful rebates this time of year I really can't complain about anything except those stupid cupholders!

Looks like I hit them head on. Took out 5 posts then rolled and slid down into grass. It totaled the car and all we got was sore necks from seatbelts. Even the airbags didn't hurt hitting us!

There's tons of room in the back for the kids to stretch out and we can still take the dog along with us on road trips and it gets decent gas mileage. The only complaint I have for my Equinox is that it is a little lightweight, if the wind is really blowing I have to keep both hands at 10 and 2 to keep it steady. But up here in Michigan we don't get too many windy days so it's only been a stressful ride once or twice. All in all it's a great little family car. Cute and fun to drive.",AWD.

It's kind of a flimsy car. My buddy sat on the hood and it dented so easily, but I guess that is just how cars are built today. It handles very nice, but does not shift smooth at all.

I didn't like the window controls on the console at first, but I got use to it. Gas mileage was great on a trip to Ocean City MD. We got about 29 mpg. My husband was excited about that. There is not a lot of room in the front. The cup holders are cheap and awkward. Despite a few negatives, we both like our Equinox.

This is  not the case with the 3.6L engine; this engine growls and throws you back in your seat on a whim.  The interior space is actually amazing on all Equinox trims, when looking at the Equinox on the outside it looks like a really small SUV/Crossover but when inside and you start to load it up, you would never know how small this vehicle actually is.

I am partial to the exteriors of the RAV4 and the Ford Edge; however, they are also lacking in the features department (at least on the basic models). The Equinox comes with a lot of bells and whistles for the price. I love the OnStar feature and the information screens. With one push of a button, I can check my oil life, tire pressure and remaining gas mileage, etc. The fuel economy isn't bad for a vehicle its size. Overall a great purchase.","Interior cloth (color, design), plentiful cup holders, OnStar and information system.","More storage area. Doors take a lot of force to shut completely. When I get out of the car and close the doors, they don't shut tightly unless you practically slam them."
4.5,Great Plus Size SUV,JB ,07/08/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,5,4,5,5,"We upgraded to the leather interior because the cloth interior was less comfortable and did not look like it would last long. There is lots of room in this SUV. We are getting 25 mpg plus right off the show room floor, that includes a 50-50 mix of city and highway driving. There is very little road noise on the inside while driving. Vehicle handles well and has more than enough power with 6 cylinder engine. The report of the cup holders is accurate, they are pretty chintzy. The lever for the steering wheel adjustment is also more difficult to operate while driving. Wish the rear hatch had an automatic open with the key chain, the gas cap door had a lock.","All the room in the is plus size SUV - sure - it is not a full size SUV/Truck, but for that class, it is perfect.",Better cup holders! Locking door to the gas cap.  
4.625,I go a lot!,chevy owner ,07/06/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,4,"The Chevy Equinox has been a great car for me. I am a detached insurance agent and this car has givin me plenty of room and comfort. It has a pretty great stereo system for those time that I have been in traffic jams and not had much to do. It gives me plenty of room in the cargo area for both my filing boxes and my luggage, and for the size of the car the fuel economy isn't bad at all. All around it has been a great car for the business man and his family.",One of my favorites is the cloth interior. As a father of a 2 yr old things get dropped in the back seat but but with a damp rag my wife and I have managed to get out every thing he can spill on it.,

5,My new Equinox,dmack ,06/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased a base Equinox in 2005 and thought it was great, but needed a bit more power. I just upgraded to the sport model which has 90 more hp and other upgrades as well. I would recommend this car to anyone in the market for a small - medium sized SUV.","Upgraded engine, OnStar, XM radio, styling",
4.375,Love my Equinox,mikey ,06/18/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,4,4,"For the money it is the best midsize crossover vehicle period. Easy entry exit. I have a bad lower back. Great view when driving. Very comfortable. A lot of room. Great engine, transmission, brakes. Prefer old style steering. Electric steering is kind of numb, vague. Not good road feel like traditional steering. Would like to see 6 speed automatic and engine with more horsepower and torque. I get a lot of compliments. Mine is ruby red.",,
4.875,Much better than Dodge,boxergirl ,06/12/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The ride in the Equinox is very smooth - the suspension is great and it drives like a car. I was also surprised coming from a much larger engine that the smaller V6 still has a lot of get up and go. In addition, I'm getting 25mpg highway and 21-22 city.  To me this is the best feature especially since the gas tank holds 20 gallons - which I think it kinda big for this size SUV.  Anyway, its nice to be able to go over 400 miles on one tank.  I just started a carpool at work, and the Equinox easily fits 4-5 adults - especially with the rear seat set back.","Radio controls on the steering wheel, leather wrapped steering wheel, fuel economy, suspension, mp3/aux slot in the radio, OnStar, and the fake woodgrain",The material of the seats stinks. It's cheap (and even worse in the LS models). Power lift gate would be nice
4.625,I love my Equinox!,Dee ,06/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,I needed more room and traded in my Chevy Malibu 2004. I love the versitility and space. It drives great and handles even better in bad weather with traction control.  ,"Traction control, and the adjustable back seat that slides forward and back.","I did not like the colors, so I chose white. My wish is that I could have found it in a muted metalic light blue color.  Make the auto start remote available on all models, I tried to add and was refused by dealer. Design the heat and air conditioning to start at the last setting."
4,Unhappy console,unhappy ,06/07/2008,,,4,5,3,4,,4,4,4,4,Overall I like the 2008 Chevy Equinox however I am very unhappy with the center console. The emergency brake is in the wrong spot and the 12VDC outlet is right under the pullout cupholders. Liquid and power do not mix well. I am really unhappy after reading earlier articles about the 2006 Chevy Equinox with the same complaints.

5,2008 Much Improved,Christine Cavadini ,06/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my second Equinox.  I previously leased a 2006 AWD LT.  I recently bought the 2008 because of great dealer incentives. This one has much better handling, fewer blind spots, and a excellent, comfortable ride. I like the standard OnStar, which I used to have in my leased Trailblazers (3 of them). The gas mileage is excellent (25-26mpg hwy) even though I'm still in the process of breaking it in. I get a lot of compliments on it and it looks very sharp in black. I also got the remote start and it is awesome (cheap add-on, too). I looked a lot of vehicles and am so glad I bought this one.","Remote start, heated leather seats, XM radio, premium speakers, sunroof, Onstar",Auto-dimming driver's side mirror.

4.5,Good buy ,conran06 ,05/22/2008,,,3,4,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I guess i got screwed because mine didn't come with free OnStar for a year, or 3 mo. of XM radio. I did buy it used though with 15,000mi. I do like the smooth drive and I think the seat cusions are very comfortable. I do not like the interior. Looks very cheap on the doors and center console. I'm not a big fan of the cushion pattern. I came from an 03 Eclipse Spider, convertable with leather. I wish I had a sunroof at least.",It's very roomy. The dash with the wood grain I like. I can plug my Mp3 player right into it. The leather steering wheel. The smooth drive and it can go when you want it to. The gas is Ok I get 20 MPG.,"A/C vents in the back.

4.875,Love it!,thare ,05/06/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I traded in my 2003 Chevy TrailBlazer EXT for the Equinox. The best thing that I ever did.The gas mileage is wonderful.  I only fill up once a week instead of twice a week. I travel 50 mile round trip for work and it has helped a lot due to the jacked up gas prices.  ,"XM radio, radio control on steering wheel, comfortable, and remote starter",Remote latch for the cargo and maybe being able to open glass on the cargo door like I had on my TrailBlazer. Maybe some more compartments
4.375,Sporty Ride,buckeye mema ,04/29/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"We have owned vans for many years but decided we wanted to size down. I loved the look & price of this car and the ride is good.  Some of the interior design is a little ""cheap"" in quality, but with the good price of the car you have to expect that.  The two things I do not like are the sun visors are too short, they could use an extension of some type & the way the hatch opens, it is hard to get it open you have to grab it in just the right place. We do take a number of weekend trips and have found the gas mileage to be getting better.  We are getting about 30 miles to the gallon now. Too bad the gas tank could not be a little bigger, but like I said we owned vans before.",The overall look of the car and the front seats are very comfortable. It has great pick up speed and drives with ease.,"Sun visors are too short when you put them to the side, and extension would help. The rear hatch door is very hard too open, you have to have your hand in just the right place or it will not open.  Make that handle work a little better."
4.875,2008 Equinox Sport,Bob 5035 ,04/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Owned the Sport version for 5 months now and love it!  Very comfortable seating both front and rear, plenty of room all around. Sport version has a stiffer ride than other versions, but not too harsh, handling is top-notch. Terrific forward visability and very stable and quiet at highway speeds.  If there is a better crossover SUV in this price range, I haven't seen it.  Only low note, is that I wish fuel mileage was 2-3 mpg better - but who doesn't?",Seating comfort and interior room is outstanding for a vehicle this size.  It is a very quiet and stable platform for freeway driving.,Parking brake interfears with console cupholder when it is out.
4.5,Wife's New Ride,Lee ,04/29/2008,,,4,5,5,4,,5,4,4,5,"After test driving suv's from Honda Pilot, Fords Edge, GMC Acadia, Saturn Vue, we decided on the Chevy Equinox. Two main reason's; 1. Ease of getting in and out of the vehicle. 2. This was the only vehicle that didn't have an obstructed view by wide front door window trims. The viewing area is much more open than any of the others. We also found the dash was not raised or slanted upward, but smoothly angles downward. Both my wife and I have bad backs and it's entry is with ease on my 6'2"" 280lb frame. My wife just lost both breasts to cancer and pulling down on the rear hatch is not a problem as it was with the other SUV's. All in all, a well rounded design and earthy downhome elegance.",Electric controls on the console. Engine smoothness in acceleration. Steering handles well and the road noise less booming than the other suv's we test drove.,Different design for the cup holders. Ability to open the rear window would be nice.
4.25,Pluses outweigh minuses,Ed Yancey ,04/26/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,3,2,5,"Vehicle looks great. Sonama Red Metalic with silver pinstripes.  Performance is outstanding and the vehicle gets a lot of looks and positive comments. Heated leather seats are a big plus.  Love the Pioneer sound system and the sunroof. Did not really plan on getting the sport as looked at the lower end models, but glad purchased this model instead. Only problem so far was in-dash cd player. It would just quit playing discs at certain times. Once ignition switch was turned off for a few minutes the cd player would work again. Sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for just a few songs. Tried different discs and same problem. Dealership replaced the radio/cd player now works fine.","Performance, nice looks, heated seats, leather seats and sun roof. Came with the sun sound and leather package that saved about $1,000 if ordered seperately. The wide rims, dual exhausts, and the front air ducts really make this SUV look bad and fast.","Do not like the wide turning radius of this suv, and the ride is a little stiff. I hoped that the gas mileage would have been a little better, but suppose that you can't have your cake and eat it too by buying the sport edition."
4.875,LTZ is a Great Package,Luv da LTZ ,04/20/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the LTZ New Year's Eve, and I am very pleased with this vehicle. I drive a lot of highway miles and average about 23 mpg, driving 65 mph. It drives smoothly, handles well, though turning radius isn't the tightest.  With the back seat pulled all the way forward, there is plenty of cargo room, and with it all the way back, plenty of leg room. The Pioneer sound system w/subwoofer gives premium sound. I would suggest adding more storage compartments. The driver's visor extends, but the passenger's does not - kind of odd.","Leather and power seats, steering wheel radio controls, 6 disc changer/XM and Pioneer sound system, heated seats, fuel economy (for an SUV)","More storage compartments, passenger visor extension, ability to open rear glass seperately on lift gate, remote opener for lift gate"
2.5,I hate my Equinox,Harry P ,04/11/2008,,,1,4,3,3,,3,1,2,3,Really disappointed that I bought this truck. Traded in my 2003 fully loaded Trailblazer EXT and this is such a step down.  GM really went the cheap route in the interior. The Sport version lists for $40k Cdn and there are so many better trucks for that amount of money.  The biggest complaint is the ride. From what I can tell the Sport is the worst of them all but it is totally uncomfortable and bounces all over the road.  This will be traded quite soon.,,
5,I love my Equinox,Bill ,04/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Well I have only had the car about a week, but it is fun to drive and has great pickup. I have the sport which gives 265 hp or so. I do wish there was a automatic release for the rear hatch by either remote and or inside latch either way would be nice, otherwise I am very happy with it and hopefully will be for a long time.

I am impressed with all the features it has for the amount of money it cost. I especially like the automatic start. I am a single woman, and this is a good feature for me.  I also like the OnStar feature and hands free telephone. I drive to work every day, a 52 mile round-trip day, so far I am getting approx 21 MPG. I hope to get better as the car breaks in, of course this is a lot better, than what I was getting with my Chevy Avalanche. My friends are very impressed with the looks of the vehicle, inside and out. So far I think I made a good decision to buy an Equinox.","The best feature for me is the automatic start and OnStar, hands free telephone.","I think you should add a device for opening cargo door, also could use more storage and a better console compartment with a lock.

Style is impressive and everything inside ""makes sense"". The ride is not as smooth as I'd like to have it, but we're not talking a Caddy here. Drive conservative and get 25 MPG, but do little city driving. Realistically, I'd probably get 21 if I drove like I used to do when gas wasn't gold plated, but if we can put a man on the moon, surely we could design one that gets 30 mpg. ","Didn't get all the bugs, bombs and whistles on this Equinox,  but as I said, the inside design makes sense and everything is where it should be.The a/c will blow the hair off a dog and will cool things off fairly quickly.","Going to take it to dealership as I noticed when stopped and then to start moving, you have to ""give"" it some gas (push on the peddle more than you'd think you should)which causes a surprize lurch at times.
