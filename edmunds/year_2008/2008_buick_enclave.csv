Luckily, the trip was only 50 miles.  I called Buick and they advised me that the warranty had expired.  I took the vehicle to a local Buick dealership which could not find anything wrong with the transmission.  I then took the vehicle to another dealership and they did discover a problem with the trans.   I called customer service about this issue and was given nothing but the runaround.  After speaking to 2 ""senior service advisors"" I was still in the same spot.  The Buick is still at the dealership waiting to get repaired (about $3000).  To top things off, I received a follow-up call from Buick.  Why? they never assisted me on anything.

The rack and pinion steering had to be replaced, also the the timing chain cover was leaking oil into the engine and needs the gasket to be replaced, front struts and mounts need replacing and the navigation system isn't working and to fix I would have to replace the entire radio system. I needed a front end alignment after they replaced the rack and pinion, another $90. The buttons to turn the fan up or down turned green after the black peeled off.

We need a new transmission. We have a 3/5/R wave plate fracture. It appears that this is a very common issue with the 2008 Buick Enclave, yet GM does not see a need to do a recall. I see unsatisfied Enclave consumers, on these forums, that are having issues with their transmission. We brought it to the service department, expecting it was still under warranty. To our surprise it was not, due to the in service date of the vehicle. Due to this date, we had missed the warranty coverage by six months. The service department quoted us $4900 to replace the transmission.We had a friend recommend calling GM direct and see if they had any cost assistance they could offer, let our frustration continue. I would like to cover the pain in detail, but there is not enough time. Basically after countless phone calls and two and half weeks later, I was told that they would not offer any help and per our case rep 70,000 miles for a vehicle, was a lot of miles. Imagine my shock that you could by a $50,000 vehicle and only expect to get 70,000 miles out of it. The woman who handled my case was rude and even suggested that maybe I should have bought a different brand vehicle.I did not expect GM to absorbthe full cost, but I was hoping they would split the cost of the repair.

2.375,Regret Purchase,wilson ,10/17/2010,,,4,4,1,1,,1,4,1,3,I really regret purchasing my Buick Enclave.  This is the first time I have purchased a Buick and it will be the last!  Had to have transmission fixed.  It took 3 weeks.  Now having the same problem.  When driving the car suddenly downshifts and I go from 65mph to 45mph and can not do anything about it.  The last time I lost all power steering.  Very dangerous when it happens on the highway.  My car is at the dealership right now and I do not want it back!,,
3,in the shop 17 times!,Dr. D ,10/12/2010,,,4,4,2,1,,2,4,3,4,"I have had numerous problems with my Enclave. It has been in the shop 17 times, towed 4 times and been jumped 3 times. I first had the battery replaced w/in 8 months of ownership and it has been downhill since. The odometer malfunctioned, water pump replaced in the 2nd year and the transmission was replaced after 2 years. The car has leaked, trunk malfunctioned, On Star was repaired and though I know I am leaving out things, you get the gist of my experience. The time spent and money wasted on car rentals is beyond acceptable. The only positive in my Buick experience is that the service center staff were wonderful and empathic; Kim went out of her way to help me out. Buyer beware!","I am so damaged by the lack of reliability, I cannot find any. Maybe the auto start feature......",Self explanatory ie. reliability.

Unfortunately, this car has had terrible reliability.  The transmission had to be replaced, several rattle and motor sounds had to be fixed, the air conditioner had to be fixed twice already and it still doesn't work, and I just had to be towed, one week after my 50,000 maintenance, because of brake issues.

The gears stripped out in the power seat control and was replaced (I'm not Fat); The entire steering column was replaced to eliminate a persistent knocking; There is a constant rubber- on-rubber squeak when you turn the steering wheel, which the dealer tells me he has brand new Enclaves with the same problem and Buick has no fix; a water pump went out last month; in cold weather the front end cracks and pops and sounds like the FWD drive train and suspension is flying apart; drips oil.  Generally speaking, it's looks good and is comfortable, but is a typical, poorly built U.S. car","Interior space layout and seating; XM/Nav/Reverse-Camera system; Good MPG (Ave. 22 MPG on a recent 2,000 mile trip to Colorado); comfortable ride and quiet, except for of all the squeaks, creaks, and rattles due to  poor fit and finish; V-6 engine will get up and move when you need it to.","Tire size exclusive to Enclave with only one Michelin and one BF Goodrich to choose from, Hi $$.

I took that advise & it was right on.  I'm about 5'5"" and my complaint is the visor doesn't block the sun when it is on the Driver's side.  Lethargic pick- up is my other complaint. There is a 'lag' when slowing down and then gaining acceleration to pass another car.  Also a little thing but important to a woman is the hook on the back of the driver's seat is useless.    ","Love the look.  We've taken several trips of 500 miles or more one way, and it is comfortable.  Drives well and has plenty of room for our golf clubs in addition to luggage.  Easy to store all the items I buy @ Target & the grocery store.  Great overall w/safety bags well protecting the car.",How about devising a visor to protect shorter people from the sun.  Definitely need to beef up acceleration.  Add a usable clothes hanging spot.  Keep the exterior look.

If this vehicle were manufactured by Ford , I'd buy another one. The GM experience is awful (and I mean GM, not just the dealer network).  For instance, I purchased a very small, boat and wanted to add a trailer hitch. The owners manual indicates that a part has to be changed if a hitch is added and the dealer will take care of it.. Not so. The small part is a the entire fuse panel and to correctly modify the electronics in this car to support  towing is so expensive the dealer wouldn't give me a price -there's even a TSB for this but GM has canceled the TSB.

The vehicle had several electrical problems that the dealer said was normal and we could pay to have it fixed. Electric window did not operate, electric seat motors were non functional, and the water pump went out right after we got it. Granted it was used with 60000 miles. One would expect the electronics and water pump to at least hit the 100000 mark. I have also noticed some other electrical problems. When the waterpump went out the vehicle gave an overtemp warning and the display showed ""shut off engine"". We immediately did.

Even with new car bugs, it is a great vehicle.  Have your alignment checked prior to 5000 miles (all wheels), warranty will cover it then.  Good mpg for this size, 22-27 highway.

So when the entire amp in the car shorted out, they used mileage as an excuse to deny warranty claim, and dumped the cost to replace a defective amp on us, the consumers.  It was a defective amp.

However, the car is very unreliable!  Our engine had been dropped three times (we only have 28,000 miles) for major repairs.  We have been without the car a total of 2 months out of the 24 we have owned it.  A number of smaller issues have emerged that are annoying (seat tracks falling apart, exterior apliques falling off in the wind, sensors failing, etc.).

CONS: Questionable build quality and reliability.  I have already been to the dealer for serious repairs multiple times. I do not trust what the dealer did to repair the car.

I drive the Enclave primarily in town and I am so disgusted with the constant downshift.  I feel like I am on a bumber ride at times.  The exterior is beautiful and interior nice but lots of trouble with gadgets that have had to be repaired under warranty.  Too many to mention. This is a total pain to drive into Madison, get a rental car and then back again to pick it up.  I am finding scary stuff again with the starter not turning over right away and one time almost hitting a car in front of me at 45 Miles per hour because the downshift became stuck and I had to hit my breaks as a quick reaction.

The driving around town in moderate traffic can cause frustration with the lack of response when the gas peddle is depressed while traveling at speeds in the 25-35 mph range.  Sometimes depending on the gear you are in you may not get much of a response initially unless you really press hard.  Sometimes it will downshift and the rpms can shoot to over 5000 when all you wanted to do was go around a slightly slower car. Can be difficult at times.,"Quiet ride, Bose stereo, interior room, overall exterior design.  Great looking car.",The transmission spoils the ride enjoyment for this vehicle.  It is always trying to upshift as soon as possible for fuel economy.

We went on a road trip in October from Arkansas to Florida with four adults and all of our luggage and there was plenty of room for everyone. The Turn by Turn Navigation was wonderful! The car is very comfortable and quiet on the road. I love the XM radio and also the fold flat third row seating. I had a Tahoe and to get the extra space in back you had to remove the seats and they were heavy! And also where were you going to put them?! The first six months have been a joy with this car! ,I love the fold flat third row seating and the ease of folding the second row seats. I was able to bring home an eight foot ladder from Home Depot and I sure couldn't have done that with the Avolon I traded in on this. I also love the XM radio & OnStar.,"The transmission sometimes seems a little ""busy"". When I have the cruise set it will downshift at the smallest incline. A little sluggish in merging too."
2.375,I hate the Buick Enclave,IHATEBUICKENCLAVE ,02/01/2009,,,3,3,2,2,,3,2,2,2,"The 2nd row (when folded forward) floats while driving (no latch to keep it in place). No room for groceries in hatch. Cannot open hatch in garage - too high. Remote start seldom works, took it to dealership and told me that ""electrical devices could be getting in the way"". Driver's side heat blasts on one side only; burning one foot while the other one freezes.  Seats six not seven comfortably. The pin stripe is one little stripe down the side and you have to pay an additional $700 for something that is already on the car; it wasn't negotiable.  No power when passing.  Bose sound is a joke as you hear everything on the outside of the car. I have had leaks and other issues. The Buick Enclave is attractive, but it is not sound proof as some guy blogged earlier. I have had this car for a year and trust me, I hear everything. I was told not to buy it but I thought it was so beautiful...regret everyday now.  I seriously hate driving this car.",I have zero favorite issues.,Heat needs to be balanced on driver's side. Remote start needs to work and when it does make it last longer than three minutes. Make a device to keep second row seats from floating back and forth while driving. Hatch needs adjustment to avoid hitting garage track. Cloth seats to hard.
4.75,The older crowd still love the Buick,Dee ,01/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I never thought that I would buy what was considered an old persons car, whether I was young or old.  Now, I am older, I love the Buicks. I researched a lot of cars and SUV's before making this choice. This SUV has something about its style and technology that when I drive it, not only am I sold but my family is happy with my choice.   ",Hand Free telephone. OnStar and the remote start for cold days. The seating for seven and the folding mirrors. Navigation system is great as I have no sense of direction.,I like to see rain guards to catch the rain from running on the electrical window buttons.

4.75,Highway is great,Don Millsap ,01/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"We purchase a new car about every 14 months, this is one of the best cars we've ever owned. Had no problems so far. Like the manual shifter in the mountains.",Love the looks of the car and so do other folks.,Hate the sunroof. Doesn't open up enough. Gas mileage could be better.
3,Buick Shmuick,MarknMich ,01/10/2009,,,4,4,3,1,,2,5,2,3,After first month of owning this Enclave has been nothing but trouble. Since June 08 we have had two transmission software updates (tranny shifting still terrible. Acts as though it doesn't know what gear it's suppose to be in). Rear liftgate opens by itself (when car off luckily). With automatic operation turned off we still hear the lift motor engage. Heat controls stopped working twice. At times when driving all gauges read as though the car is turned off. With cruise control set at 75 MPH for nearly two hours the best MPG I get is 17. In city getting 13 MPG is a good day. Dealer is trying their best but I don't hold out for much improvement.,Interior / exterior design,How long has GM been making transmissions? Based on this car one would think this is their first attempt.
4.75,"A great, but not perfect",erumo ,12/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Overall a very good vehicle. I'm very glad that I overcame my bias that Buick is for grandparents. This one is definitely worth checking out when considering Lexus or BMW. My minor negatives: I'm 5'11"" and once adjusted the steering wheel almost totally obstructs the speedometer. The navigation system is hands down the worst one I've owned. It often will not recognize side roads and has poor voice prompts for upcoming turns. I find myself frequently looking at the screen when I can rely completely on voice prompts with my other vehicles. Finally, the second row captain seats are great, but a console option between them would be a welcome addition.","Smooth quiet ride, very relaxing driving experience. Second row 110v standard outlet is great for the kid's video games or other small electronics.","Replace navigation system, improve instrument layout, add second row console."
4.25,The jury's still deliberating,DAz ,12/13/2008,,,5,5,3,3,,4,5,4,5,"We moved out of the domestic market in the 1990's for better quality, e.g. Nissan, Lexus. We wanted an AWD SUV and deduced that the quality imports had gotten out of our reach. We were really taken by the Enclave when we tested one out, so we ordered one. To our disappointment we have found that the wheels & hubs build up with snow, ice or mud which sets up an uncomfortable vibration Which can only be alleviated by washing the wheels thoroughly with a pressure washer. The Dealer tells us that this is a common issue in all the newer vehicles due to the open hub. I am suspicious that this is a run around.  I also drive a 2008 Explorer at work that exhibits no such problem.  ","Great looks, the quietness is excellent has a great sound system, has adequate power for our requirements, has good cargo space for travel for 4 adults.  The fuel consumption at 25 mpg is reasonable for such a large vehicle and the handling is excellent. We really like the 3rd row seating.  ","GM should build a better suspension system for this vehicle or if it is a rim problem, provide a better style or make.  The vibration can be so severe at times that it almost makes one ill. I find it almost astounding that a 60,000+ vehicle has this issue and a 30,000 dollar Explorer doesn't.  "
5,This Ain't Your Grand Pa's Buick,j graham ,11/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was a little unsure going from a Lexus RX 300, but now I can tell you I have surely traded up! It felt a little big at first, but I have come to love the looks, driveablity and functionality. It has plenty of power. I got very concerned during the high gas prices recently, but my mileage has actually improved. I have put on 10000 miles in 5 months. I get about 19 in my combo city/interstate work commute driving and about 27, yes 27 on the open highway. Also recently during the hurricane damage and recovery it has come in very handy making trips to Lowes and Home Depot. We got it fully loaded with AWD. We love all the features - lots of luxury and a sport drive.","Backup camera, navigation, DVD, auto folding mirrors. 3rd row of seats with quick conversion to cargo.  Front seat warmers.  Quiet package, Bose, AWD, the luxury ride! I also get lots of nice comments from people at stores and gas stations.","Ad rainsensor windshield wipers, ad a door bumper guard down the side.

5,Way to go GM! A great luxurious ride.,Dan ,11/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Wanting to replace my Escalade, I looked at Mercedes, Lexus, Infiniti, Acura, & Mazda's. I then found the GM Lamda platform of which Traverse caught my eye first. I then drove the Outlook and Acadia but after I drove the Enclave I knew! It had such an incredibly smooth, quiet ride with technology only found in more expensive vechiles. After I get over the shock that I am driving a Buick (it looks so damn good for a Buick!), all else has been a fantastic experience for me. This platform should help Americians look at buying a great product from their own country again.  ","Articulating Xenon lights make a huge difference. Backup camera, extremely impressive interior room, ease of access of 3rd row seats through cabin seats, cargo space behind 3rd row, quiet and smooth ride, beautiful exterior, gas mileage for such a large vehicle",Road performance but it is such a mellow cruiser who needs it?

5,Great Crossover SUV,Texas Owner ,11/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We absolutely love this crossover. We receive many compliments on its styling. Absolutely no problem other than the transmission hesitates on occasion. There is a program change we are considering which I'm told will seem like a 50 hp boost..downside I'm told might be a lost in fuel economy (Currently 17.9 MPG in town and consistently with hard driving on the freeway 21+ MPG). We bought the factory running boards-they are very helpful for some elderly folks we transport and it really dresses up that vehicle..and they fit perfectly into the styling. Only downside, power lift hits our garage door (triggers automatic close) so we have to turn it off when we drive into the garage.  ","Love the styling, love the factory running boards, backup warning excellent, on board navigation features helps you, with a touch, know the condition of your vehicle down to tire pressure in each tire. Great for carrying a lot of passengers. Quiet to the point you can hear those talking in far back.",Add coat hangers in second row. Sharp plastic lower seat edge (lower left rider seat) caught my suit pants cuff and ripped it-need to round the plastic farther into the bottom of the seat. I think the grill could use some improvement.  I change my own oil-put the filter at the bottom of the engine.
4.875,Audi Q7 killer!,GCH ,11/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just yesterday our Enclave was finally delivered. We had to wait a few months as we had the car imported from the US. We had driven the car during our two weeks holidays in Florida May 2008 and fell in love with it. The car drives smoothly, is silent and has a lot of space. With 3 children the Enclave is the perfect family car. Classy and not as ordinary as a BMW X5 or Audi Q7. The fun part is that the Enclave offers as much as these cars but is far cheaper. Too bad that the XM radio does not work in Europe. It uses fuel but not as much as expected. We like the seats for total 8 people and the exclusive look & feel of the Enclave. We are sure to enjoy the Enclave for a many years to come.  ","8 seats, quiet tuning, design and styling, we have the diamond white, fantastic colour.",The sound of the Bose system is not bad but a subwoofer is recommendable.

Once in for electrical problems after owning it for 3 months. 3 times in for leak in ceiling (water drips in through the third row overhead maplights). The car came back to me after being in the shop (3rd time for leak) last week. So far, so good. No more leaks. Mileage is worse than what GM claims averaging 19 overall highway with stop and go a lot. Beautiful driving as it is very quiet. Pickup is just okay though.","Quiet ride, comfortable seating position","Better stereo system, paint chips easily (opened door into a bunch of low plants as I parked too close on the side...chipped paint off car on  door's edge.

Camshafts, weird engine noises, minor electrical freak- outs- and that's only within the first 3 months of ownership. The design is good but build quality is very average - panels do not align well, some a crooked, etc. It does what it is designed for - haul 7-8 people, but the transmision will make you adjust your driving style to a typical Buick drivers style.

I am averaging 17.8mpg around town,  one small trip got 25.4mpg. High quality and attention to detail make it extra special.

4.625,One Year Update!,Adams Family ,09/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,The Enclave has been apart of our family for over a year now and we enjoy it everytime we drive it. Our white CX model with black cloth seats has been through a lot in a year and passed with flying colors. The Buick has been on several long distance road trips and returned 23 to 24 MPG with cruise set on 70-72 MPH. Except for a recall to reprogram the transmission to shift quicker we have only been to the dealer for regular oil changes. We have towed a pop-up camper to state parks and have folded all the seats down to fit a full size dresser (new in its box) in the back. Our model has the second row bench seat and we are glad we got it since our newborn and his carseat fit comfortably. ,The HVAC system on this car is incredible. Texas summertime temps of 105 outside and we hit the remote start and within five minutes the car is cooled to 72. Winter saw several snow days and ice on the windshield the heated washer fluid works very well. The car is also very quiet on the road.  ,I wouldn't spring for the leather. It's too hot where we are anyway. Ditch the cloth floormats and get a set of all-weather mats that fit the footwell. Our car didn't come with the tow package but I found aftermarket hitches that have worked great and saved us probably $400.

We traded in a '01 Expedition with the same 1st and 2nd row captain chairs as the Enclave. I'm 46 and I never thought I'd own a Buick but I don't regret it at all. For the money, the seating configuration, capacity, features, performance, this is an absolute bargan.  We were closely looking at the GMC Acadia (which is great as well) but the luxury, quiet ride, looks won us over. We looked at many other brands in this segment but there were very few that could seat 7 with the dual captain chairs.  The V6 has plenty of power and transmission seems to shift smoothly for us.  Great job Buick! We are very satisfied.  GM should use this as an example to improve their bottom line.","Opt 4 DVD/NAV entertainment. Cocoa metalic paint, 19"" wheels, smooth quiet ride, and my favorite: Plenty of leg room for someone that is over 6 foot tall. In fact, I have more leg room than my Ford Expedition.

4.875,The Best Vehicle I've Ever Owned,Sheila ,07/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love this vehicle. It drives very smoothly. I bought the navigation system and used it and OnStar for a recent trip to CA. The best road trip I've ever taken with the turn-by-turn directions. The seats are extremely comfortable and I have it on good authority from my family that you can actually seat 3 people in the third row without being too uncomfortable. The way the second row moves forward makes it easy for people to sit in the third row and gives ample leg room for both the second and third row. I am thrilled with my purchase. The only negative is that I'm only averaging 14.3 mpg in town, but do believe I hit the 24 mpg on the highway trip to CA. I love the diagnostic reports.",Soft leather seats that breath. Instrument panel is great. Versatility of seat formation. Sound system is very nice. Lots of cup holders. Real smooth ride.,Passenger door interferes with glove box. The storage console is too small to hold CD's. The seat belt connector on the second row seats is too high and hurts like the devil when sat on. The door swing does not hold and if you're not careful it'll close back on you.   
5,Greatest SUV ever!,Buickfan ,07/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We loved our Enclave before taking a 5400 mile road trip with 4 adults plus luggage, but now we wouldn't part with it for any vehicle on the road. For 5400 miles we averaged 20.2 miles per gallon, which we were really happy about since the vehicle was loaded.  We drove through the Pennsylvania hills and the car performed beautifully - not a sign of the transmission hesitancy some people grouse about. The ride was superb, the carrying capacity was more than adequate, and the interior arrangement was really handy for all of the things we took.  ","On our extended trip we made good use of the navigation system. It never failed us, and was fun to use. The handling and comfort of the vehicle are truly outstanding.",It would be useful to have some sort of warning when you exit the vehicle and leave the sun roof open.

I am totally impressed with this vehicle. Gas mileage was decent at 23.9MPG. This is a sexy looking CUV both in and out and is extremely quiet. The seats are extremely comfortable front and back. The nav system is also a great feature that I found invaluable driving in unfamiliar cities. OnStar is also great, I love the personal service that you get with this. This should be standard on all vehicles. I will be using this car to haul long items and I have more room than my old Dodge Caravan. The seats can be configured to fit almost any need. Congrats to the Buick designers","The overall look, nav system, and OnStar. Turning headlights are great at night.  I definitely recommend the white diamond tri coat finish, it is stunning.

Drove 1000 straight miles only stopping for breaks and gas. Never felt tired or stiff. Seating and ease of handling are exceptional. Lives up to and exceeds quiteness claims. Did not find that shifting was a problem as other owners have eluded to, it was very smooth even with numerous terrain changes. This vehicle will get 27 MPG+ at 60 MPH on a level road. This is a great car for the money. Exterior and interior styling and workmanship are outstanding. Presently have 8500 miles on vehicle.

Bad things: I get 16 mpg consistantly, much less than I expected. Transmission is a constant issue. Pulling on to a highway from an on ramp into traffic is tricky as this car just doesn't have the acceleration or power needed to pull this off effortlessly. When heat/AC is on with the fan it is very loud. Moulding of the front bumper comes to a point and is very low to the ground. Watch curbs when parking!

The Enclave is a big jump in quality especially for the price. The XC90 equipped similarly would cost $10K more. The ride is very smooth and quiet.  We bought it loaded. My daughter loves the DVD. I like OnStar, navigation system, back-up camera and power liftgate. Adults can actually sit in the 3rd row comfortably. Behind the 3rd row there is room for luggage or coolers for tailgating.

The tranny is designed to max your mpg, not your quarter-mile times. We've had two long road trips, and this is way more comfy than my ""class leading"" 01 Grand Caravan ever was.

On a trip to Phoenix I got 21 MPG and that is averaging 75 mph! Being a S Californian I calibrated up to 31 miles per gallon going from Beaumont Ca, to Onterio airport Ca about 50 miles. Every time the freeway: Hwy 10 was going down hill I put the car in neutral. You can't even tell when it is coasting or not! That way I save the expensive gas and it runs on regular.

I have also carried a full load of people on a 4-hour trip with no complaints and 20MPG. Not bad for 7 Adults and one child. As for around town driving, I get an average of about 17MPG with mostly local driving.

The dealer service department said they get tons of calls with dissatisfied customers regarding mileage of the Enclave. The transmission is also a bit screwy, you really have to push on the gas to convince it to downshift on a hill - and mine supposedly has had that transmission ""fix"" from the earlier versions.

3.25,Transmission Problem at 5000 miles!,Little Lady ,04/11/2008,,,4,4,4,1,,2,4,3,4,"Bought my Enclave because I needed an SUV that had seats that adjust for small adult as well as large. I am the small adult in the family and still have to use a pillow to see over the dash! Nice color brown exterior and dark charcoal interior. Drives like a tank, very heavy metal. Shifting is not right, hence transmission problem. Low road noise with windows closed but then need the AC recirculating feature to stay on in every setting, not. Overall, a good luxury SUV for a big person not sensitive to exhaust and polluted air.","Color, XM radio choices, OnStar, Bose speakers, DVD in the back to watch a movie. All cosmetic. ","Transmission problem, car in shop right now! Won't go into 2nd, 3rd gears.Gas petal not positioned right, uncomfortable heel placement. Driver side mirror blocks view  turning left, dangerous situation. Doors are so heavy, will bruise leg if hit when getting in or out. Roof rack too wimpy for use. "
4.75,Great Car,MH ,04/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Have had this vehicle since Sept and love it. Quiet, smooth ride and a pleasure to drive. Have put 13,000 miles already.

4.875,Enclave,Madeline ,04/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"It's extremely quiet. The ride & handling are superior. It tows our 3500 lb. boat with the greatest of ease. It's truly a beautiful vehicle inside and out, and has all the bells & whistles. Just want to drive it all the time.",Sunroof & separate skylight. Backup camera & sensors. Power window memory which includes steering wheel & outside rearview mirrors. 2nd row captain chairs. All the different programing available.

4.25,A Lexus for a Buick,Karen ,04/02/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,4,5,4,4,"I traded my 2003 Lexus GX for the Enclave and so far so good. The ride is very smooth. Comparable to the Lexus. Drives like a car, which I like since I also traded my Accord on this vehicle. Figured I only needed one car and the Enclave was the combination of the two I was looking for. Granted it's not a Lexus but so far it's pretty close. I would say it's lacking on acceleration but so far it hasn't been that big of a deal. Gas mileage varies from 14 to 22 and I check it myself, I don't rely on what the info center tells me. Visibility trying to back up is limited and yes I have the back up camera but it makes me dizzy and it's hard to see it in the daytime when its sunny. Overall a winner","Deep seats- I'm tall, articulating headlights-too cool, XM and Onstar, cupholders and storage, dual sunroof, power liftgate, finally third row seats that fold flat, and let's not forget the Bose radio. Also the power folding mirrors.","Better visibility in the back, better gas mileage driving around town, a little disappointed there. Better acccelaration off the start, just a bit sluggish. The tilt mirrors tilt down too far. I loved them on my Lexus but not on this car, maybe there's a setting for them I just haven't found yet."
4.625,Love This New Crossover,bondguy ,04/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"I have only had the Enclave for a few days but love driving it. I get many stares from people and people can't believe it's a Buick once they see it and look inside. Very roomy and great looking from every angle. Looked at Mazda CX9 and Volvo XC90...the Buick puts both to shame. It is roomier than both and although fully loaded doesn't have all the Mazda has to offer, and the Mazda was a lot cheaper to lease, I don't regret my decision to go with the Buick over the Mazda. The steerable headlights are great at night...and, unlike the Mazda, you aren't forced to choose between a rear seat DVD and a sunroof...the Buick has two roofs...Congrats GM on finally getting it right!Former Audi owner","Dual roofs, wood steering wheel and trim, retro look, steerable  headlights, all around beauty of vehicle. Quietness is amazing!","Needs a exit handle on drivers side to help get in and out easier, Bluetooth. Keyless pushbutton start would be nice"
5,More than satisfied,Tommyboy ,04/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"So after much consideration between all the lambda options, we kept coming back to the Buick Enclave CXL. The Saturn was nice but we kept thinking the resale was going to be the lowest of all three. The GMC was great, but no perferated seats (we live in NC and leather and sun don't mix well!)and no cocoa interior. So, we settled on the Enclave. And are very happy we did!  Everywhere we go people want to look inside and are blown away at how large it is in interior volume. When I tell them it is the same as a Tahoe or Yukon, they are amazed.  This really is a minivan inside and sport utility outside. ",Captains chairs are great! No more kids sitting to close to each other! (Stop touching me..ugh) Love the quite ride! You can really tell the difference. Love the Dolby surround sound on the movies. The headphones and audio are amazing. Gas mileage is great too! I get 19 in town and 24-25 highway,"I wouldn't mind cooled seats and the gear thing, but really it doesn't bother me as much. I am sure it could benefit from another gear but other than that it is a wonderful vehicle. Very well thought out and a pleasure to drive. I can't believe its a Buick!"
4.25,From Lexus to Buick?,Karen ,04/01/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,4,5,4,4,"I traded my 2003 Lexus GX470 for the Enclave. I questioned my decision so many times but in the end decided to go with the Buick. Yes a Lexus for a Buick. I think I was just ready for a change and from the first time I saw the Enclave I knew I liked it. For one it drives as nice as the Lexus and feels more like driving a car (which I also traded-Honda Accord)on the Enclave. Yes two perfectly good vehicles for one. So far I like the Enclave. I too have noticed it hesitates trying to get up to speed but once you do it's fine. Gas mileage is 14-22. Maybe it will get better. I hope, at least driving around town. All in all I'm happy with my trade. I love the look of the it. Very sharp.","The depth of the seats,very comfortable because I'm tall, articulating headlights-I love what they do when you start the car, XM and knowing I have OnStar, dual sunroof, and just some features my Lexus didn't have like the the third row seats that fold flat. ","Larger floor mats,the trim around the nav screen and radio looks too cheap compared to the rest of the vehicle, more take off power-just needs a little more pep,other than that I think it's great."
4.625,"UnBuick-like, bargain-priced Lexus.",skintrade ,03/28/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,4,5,"Traded my BMW 3-series for this car. With a Lexus and a Bimmer, never thought I'd get a Buick, but couldn't find anything we liked better after looking at the Audi Q7, BMW X5, Lexus GX.  None of those had as much 3rd row back seat room or ease of access as the Enclave. And this comes with nearly the same bells and whistles. Yes, a few parts appear cheap, but the quality and elegance of the rest of the interior far outpowers them. Cabin feels like flying first class in a plane. 5.1 Bose surround sounds amazing.  Wish it had automatic self- closing driver/passenger doors, they're german car heavy! Handling suprisingly sporty, rides smooth & quiet.  This is the car that will save Buick.","Interior, exterior design, 2nd/3rd row room and access.  Features and amenities. Price.",Needs automatic self-closing driver/passenger doors.

It is fun to drive, has exceptional room, is really comfortable, and everyone else loves it too. The interior has absolutely no cheap look or feel.  So what if there is fake wood trim. I would rather have that than have to worry about keeping the finish on real wood. The transmission has been no problem at all. It is very smooth, and the car is powerful enough to easily accelerate to highway speeds when merging with traffic. I looked at the MDX, and the Mazda whatever it is numbered. They don't even come close to the value in this vehicle.  ","Handling, navigation system, interior luxury, and roominess.   The Bose sound system is great also. We have a Bose home entertainment system, and the one in the Enclave is competitive with it.  ","I haven't found any to mention yet.

Handles like a car while also wowing my clients.  From the stylish exterior to the classy interior, I have enjoy the comfort of driving this since November 2007. I am very pleased with my selection.

5,Back to America!,rokalada ,03/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After deciding we needed a more economical car to take the family and four dogs to our weekend place about 150 miles from home, we started looking at SUV's, CUV's, etc. I used to drive Mercedes wagons, and I was drawn back to them, but the middle row leg room is too short for our tall, adult-sized children, and the other Mercedes that did ""fit"" us (the R class) could not haul a trailer that we sometimes use. Enter, the Enclave! I took delivery on a CXL this week, and so far, I am very impressed!  I've only gassed up once, but it got well over 20 mpg in mixed driving.  The ride is comfortable, and I like the solid feel to the doors when you shut them --- very unlike a Honda!","Leg room!  I am over six feet tall, as are our kids, and everyone has plenty of legroom and headroom!","The dash is a little bit ""plastic"" looking.

4.125,Ordered New. Very good but not perfect ,Glenn ,03/13/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,2,4,"Ordered the Enclave in December and received in late February. Nice suv crossover. Heavy car that rides reasonable nice and very quite. I'm looking forward to future editions already to improve on some of the deficiencies that many have already described. Overall I'm very pleased with this first time purchase of a Buick. I previously owned several GM TrailBlazers and S10 Blazers. This vehicle is big inside and out. The cockpit feel is true and I flew a plane and can attest to the similar look and feel of the Cessna. Lots of forward glass with a clear unobstructed view. Back window view is very small, but not a big deal. I ordered without the overhead retractable window. Overall nice vehicle","Articulating headlights, navigation system, many water pockets, quite ride, excellant folding flat rear seats. nice wood trim, sharp sporty look in white with 19"" wheels. Heated seats, great lighting systems and back up camera. Folding mirrors. ",Gas mileage stinks at 15+/- per mile. Telescopic steering is nice but does not move enough upward and out of the way to get in or out without hitting your legs if you are a bigger person.

In a nutshell, any wonderful features I enjoyed have been eclipsed by the incredibly terrible transmission.  It is just not a pleasure to drive in the hills of western PA. This transmission does not know how to handle them. I'm taking it in this Monday for service, Buick tells me there is a recall for ""Transmission Calibration""  my suggestion for anyone interested is waitil the bugs are cleared up on this vehicles transmission. It will negate all the beautiful and comfortable features this vehicle has and ruin the driving experience.","Quiet, comfortable, beautiful.","If the dealer cannot repair the performance of the transmission, then I suggest the design engineers take a good look at this vehicle in geographic areas with hills.

I suppose because it they were, as the old saying goes, your fathers car. However, Buick has distanced itself from that saying with the Enclave. The cars that I have owned were simply transportation to me. I did not consider them fun to drive. There have only been two cars that I really enjoyed driving.

There is little wind and road noise. The all wheel drive is great in both snow and ice. The air conditioning is very good. The car gets many compliments on its styling.","All wheel drive, remote start, navigation, turning headlights.","Heated steering wheel, cooled seats, more torque, have the transmission hold gears a little longer (it hunts back and forth on moderate to steep hills), a better quality ""retractable"" cargo cover instead of the cheap removable cover supplied.

4.875,One of GM's best in many years,Bert ,01/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This Enclave is the 27th vehicle I have owned, the great majority being GM brands.  I had about given up on GM for my next vehicle until I saw the Enclave at the Phoenix Auto Show.  I purchased one two weeks later and love it.  The quality is exceptional and the styling and performance leave nothing to be desired.  ","Remote start, park assist, memory settings on power tilt/telescopic steering wheel.",Only thing I can suggest would be a power folding third row seat and that is certainly no critical item- convenience only because the seat is so easily folded.
4.5,Where are the options and power?,Ron Scindle ,01/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"I'm very excited the Buick Enclave I purchased has been the hit of our neighborhood.  Everyone likes the design of the exterior and interior as much as I do.  I love almost everything about the car with the exception of the following things. Why arn't heated seats in the rear available? They are in some of the other SUV's that GM makes, but on this car they are missing.  I wanted all options, but when the car arrived it didn't have the luggage rack cross bars I bought and paid for.  The running boards were also paid for and the dealer can't tell me when the delivery date might be. The sales information states the the rear headphones come with option 3, but I now find out that isn't true. ",Style and comfort are the most important features.,Information center should be in the overhead.  Lights showing distance from fixed objects are hard to see in their current locartion.  They should be in the rear view mirror.  Heat the rear seats.  Power is very poor.  I had a Jeep Liberty with a turbo four cly. diesel that had a lot more power this
5,Love my new Enclave,JRoshto ,01/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought mine on New Years Eve. Looked all over for the Red Jewel one. Went to a dealer the day before and they sold the one I wanted an hour before I got there. Managed to locate one the next day and bought it. I love it. I've always been a Honda buyer so this is my first American car for a while. This is definitely my red jewel.  It's gorgeous, and fun to drive and so very smooth.  Plus the family love all the options we got with the DVD play XM radio etc.  ","XM radio, navigation, and love the classy wood trim.  Seats are very comfortable and also love the sun roof and remote start.  I'm from Florida and it got cold down here for a couple of days.  Loved the remote start to get the car warmed up.  Probably will love it in the summer too.",The only thing I can think of would like it to get 30 miles per gallon.

It's roomy, beautiful,and loaded with all the features anyone could want and you don't need to take out a mortgage to own it!

Fully loaded with the 7 passenger seating this car is nicer than a Mercedes GL or R Class.  I never thought I'd buy a Buick, but after istting in this car and test driving it, we knew we had found a winner.   GM's 100K mile warranty makes ownership hassle free.  Other reviewers have mentioned it, the car would benefit from more power, but then again, gas isn't going back to $2/gallon anytime soon, and for around town there's plenty of power.  How many people are going to drag race with this car anyway.  Second row bucket seats make 3rd row access easier, and really make this a hands down winner it its class!  ","Too many to list!  For the 1st time in her life, my wife is actually reading the owners manual to learn about all the user adjustable features on this car.  Remote start that turns on the seat warmers is a really nice touch!","Another 30 horsepower would be nice, but sufficient power for around town.

4.875,GM hit a home run,NorthvilleMI ,12/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,This vehicle is outstanding - and my other car is a Honda.  The exterior styling is great.  The interior detail is top notch.  The ride is incredibly smooth and very quiet at high speeds.  Great vehicle for a night out or a family trip.  Very luxurious and good material and build quality.  This is the best vehicle I have ever driven.,"Styling and captain's chairs for easy access to the 3rd row.  I was never a believer in OnStar, but now I am sold -  the hands free and turn by turn navigation is incredibly easy to use and convenient (beats having a navigation system to program).  The power lift gate is very nice.","Expect some engine noise in low gears at high RPM.  Over 10-15 mph, it disappears and you can barely tell that the engine is on.  Voice recognition for OnStar would be nice."

The power liftgate is a plus. The Buick accessories help to make this a world class looking vehicle,and at a reasonable price. The ride is exceptional. The transmission shifts often with city driving, but it is smooth. This, I think helps with fuel.    ","The advance remote starter, power liftgate and the exceptional radio.

The design is sleek and beautiful.We have the Cocoa metallic color. The car gets head turning stares and lots of comments from other drivers. We have driven in the mountains and it has great pickup on long climbs. Absolutely love the ability to manually shift from 1st to 6th gears. Fold down seats make lots of cargo space. Remote opening of the lift gate helps when you have large loads. It is so quiet thanks to Thinsulate insulation. The mirrors are large,easily adjustable. 12 cup holders means no spills. Numerous airbags make me feel safer,esp with kids in tow. We love the sound system. Great car!","Head & leg room. Quiet drive. Looks, lots of chrome. Everything adjusts.",More interior color choices.

The quietest vehicle in my experience of 50 years of driving. Some pseudo sophisticates gripe about the fake wood. Of course it is fake, but it is beautiful and adds to the excellent interior design.  Get over yourselves.

The Enclave CXL exceeds comparisons to any simliar luxury class vehicle. At first look your eyes can't help but notice the attractive styling looks of the exterior. Buick is on track with one of the finest SUv's ever built by GM's so called ""Mom and Dad's"" Buick vehicle line. The luxurious leather and wood grained interior, Bose sound system and extremely quiet ride is worthy of a world class luxury automobile costing tens of thousands more! The interior experience and ride and handling is so impressive. After I park it, I can't wait to drive it again! My VP at work was so impressed, he mentioned trading in his Wife's Lexus for the CXL.","Beautiful styling cues.

5,A Must Have!,Rodder ,11/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Owned a 2000 Jimmy, & my wife wanted something new. I actually wanted a GMC Acadia since they came out but also looked at Ford, Lincoln, Chrysler and Mitsubishi SUV's and crossovers. Needed something that could tow my boat, haul my 2 sons and their instruments (Cello & an upright Bass) and room for 2 big dogs. The dealer had a couple of Enclaves on the lot so we test drove one - it became a must have. Nothing else that fit our requirements compared. We bought one in Moca w/ Ebony leather, sun roof, (the wife's must have and 2 are better than one) and the 4500# towing package. So far, after 1500 miles of mostly around town w/ some expreesway driving we are getting 18.5MPG - pleasently suprised","Back up sensors and the Bose sound system are great. The HID lights make night driving a pleasure. Really roomy and comfortable. Fit & finish are excellent. Towing is fantastic, hardly know its back there, the 13"" brakes make stopping while towing easy.","Only 2 things I can think of, how about clocks that are tied to the national Atomic clock so you don't have to ever adjust them, and a blue tooth system that will work with any blue tooth enabled cell phone."

The Enclave is so much more though, we bought the 8 passenger seating, which we could not get in the CX-9 and it still feels like we have lots of space. I really enjoy the roominess of the front seating area and love the looks of the Enclave. This is the best vehicle we have ever bought and doubt we could top it anytime in the near future, we are spoiled! It was worth the six month wait!","Headlights that follow the road, All the room inside, the look of the vehicle, and the most comfortable seating ever!

I took a drive and ride test earlier this year with a side by side comparison with the Lexus & Acura. It braked, handled, steered and was much quieter than either of the other foreign vehicles in its class  I was so impressed that I had to have one. I order the new Moca color with tan interior. My wife loves the color combination and the beautiful styling too. She likes that she can set her own temp on her side of the vehicle.  We were impressed with the ride, handling and braking. The pickup was more than enough for our needs. ",Articulating headlamps are a great feature. The remote starter that turns on the heated seats and rear defogger when needed. I just love the teal blue interior lighting along with the dash that is on all the time. I like the steering wheel controls which are well thought out and easy to use.,I would like to get the extended range remote and the console for the middle row soon. Perhaps have cooled seats as an added feature also.

Pretty well thought out interior/exterior, but as always, there is room for improvement. We have experienced none of the transmission shifting issue that some of the earlier models had. If you want a performance vehicle, then maybe you better look elsewhere. The motor may be a little underpowered, but is adequate. The ride/quiet interior are just like advertised.

Its design elements all blends together appealingly devoid of any offensive lines and/or bulges like most other vehicles. This SUV is pleasant to the eyes. As for performance, it could use a few more horses, otherwise it is a well equiped and capable SUV. Maybe shedding a few lbs will do the trick. Bravo Buick!   ","The comfortable leather seats helps alleviate the bottom half (pardon the pun) during long excursions, while the top notch sound system together with a delectable ambiance of its interior wisk you away to someplace dreamlike. Also the power/memory driver seat is great. ","Replace the cheap plastic materials used in some parts of the vehicle. The use of cheap carpet-like material on the back of the 2nd and 3rd row seats is a big mistake, I'm being nice here. Finally, those wells on the floor for the 2nd row seats to slide on is poorly conceived. Come on GM, strive. "
5,Proud Owner!,Kim ,09/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We love our Enclave. It is fun to drive and easy to handle. The back up sensors are awesome. A breeze to park in small crowded parking lots. Gets a lot of attention every where we go. The whole family enjoys riding in this car. My Dad liked it so much they bought one of their own!,The option to have the seat belt in the third row middle seat attached for use or stored for when the seats are folded flat. the power tail gate controls on the front pannel. The roomy storage behind the third row. Love the moving headlights so much I miss them if I have to drive a different car.,I agree with the other post that the steering wheel needs to move high and blocks the speedometer. The front window controls little hard to get use to. Wish the center console for 2nd row was avalible. Need some kind of cover that can allow seats to move but not let small things fall into tracking
4.875,Hangers?,Beaty's ,09/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Fit and finish all seem top notch. Overall, the car is better than anticipated. Haven't had it long enough to know about reliability. Only complaint is how to hang clothes on the second row seating, as in picking up dry cleaning.","Comfortable seats, quiet ride with great sound system.",Clothes hangers accessible from rear doors. If they exist I haven't figured out where.
4.625,Can't Believe I Bought a Buick!,Dee ,09/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,4,"I truly can't believe I bought a Buick. This is my first American car. I love this car. I have never had so many people give me compliments and ask ""What car is that?"". The ride is very quiet and the captain's chairs are fantastic. The car looks fantastic and also to drive. My son loves the DVD with the wireless headphones. I fell in love with the turn by turn directions which I use a lot and the emergency phone in the car via OnStar can be very helpful if you are in a jam. Lastly, I use the remote start a lot as I live in FL and it gets very hot and it cools down the car before I get in with my toddler.","Turn by Turn directions. Quiet ride. Backup sensors. Captain chairs. Power liftgate. Remote start. Most of all, the quiet interior.",Locking gas cap. Better gas mileage
4.875,From BMW to Buick and happy.,Mario ,09/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"As a BMW owner for the last 10 years this is my first purchase of a Buick ever. To be honest there hasn't been a Buick model that ever looked worthy of owning, untill now. I have only had it for 3 weeks and so far this looks like it will be a winner for GM. The ride and interior are both very comfortable and the value received for the money spent is incredible. Every option that you could want at about $300 a month less in a lease versus BMW. Of course this large vehicle does not accelerate nor corner like an X5 but it wasn't built for that. Nevertheless, it does what it was built to do and very well I may add. A great vehicle for mid to long road trips. I highly recommend it.","Touch screen navigation and built in XM satellite radio. The interior look and design complete with wood grain & four bucket seats. The 19"" chrome wheels add a distinct look to the exterior.",The vehicle does need a more powerful engine option in my opinion. A 300 HP plus 6 cyl or even an 8 would be nice. A bluetooth feature. A second row console as advertised by GM should be offered and it isn't. I would also like to see GM upgrade the quality of plastics used on the interior.
4.25,Reserved but hopeful,David ,09/10/2007,,,4,5,5,4,,4,4,4,4,"Traded in my wife's beautiful inspiration yellow T-Bird on a Buick...and I questioned our sanity on both purchases. One day after purchase we ventured out on a 1000 mile winery tour and I'm happy to say we feel our minds are in fact stable. I'm around/in vehicles of all kinds in various stages of their life every day, so my ratings are on a very broad scale of experience. I was suprised by the admirable mpg averages and it's ability to make hours behind the wheel pass quickly and comfortably.  We have every option but AWD and the Luxury package (folding mirrors, power wheel, and the lighting trick GM killed the Tucker for some 50 years ago), so we'll see how it all holds up. God Bless!","I like all the gadgets, but I worry things like the Nav system and complex radio controls will distract my wife, who is the primary driver. The Nav saved alot of back-tracking on a couple occasions, as some of the directions in brochures are just wrong!  The whole package works well together.","Should have (at least as options) adjustable pedals, 8-way passenger seat and seat ventilation. Someone also needs to develop front/corner sensors for parking in small spaces, as you cannot judge the edges of this vehicle easily. Some fit/finish issues as expected first year, but nothing glaring."
5,Makes my 07 Acura MDX look bad,ExRIGuy ,09/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We are a mid 30's couple with 3 kids who typically buys imports. I recently purchased a 2007 Acura MDX Sport to replace a Lexus -- so I have a good reference point. We traded in a Toyota Sienna. Never thought we'd buy a Buick, but were always open to an American car that is competitive on the merits. This car makes a mockery of most competitors. This is a remarkable car that feels like it should cost $15k more (at least).  Build quality and quietness are superior to my Acura, and it is far more plush and stylish in my opinion. It appears to be nothing short of the rebirth of the American family vehicle. Put your image of Buick as you know it aside and give this thing a try.  ","Interior is a future classic, gorgeous materials for the money.  The use of the more than ample space is fantastic. Love the space behind the third row, and this thing is quiet!  Engine even sounds nice --like my Acura's! ",Didn't care for the two-tone coloring on some color choices. Bose stereo is a bid weak sounding for what you'd expect. 
4.875,Very nice so far,Steve White ,09/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought my Enclave (CXL, AWD) 3 days ago and very pleased so far. Traded up from a 2002 Rendezvous, and if you know that car you'll know I had some concerns about buying another Buick. The Enclave, however, is superb: no defects and no trips back to the dealer. Handling and ride are far superior to the Rendezvous, and to the other 'cross-over' cars we looked at. The Ford Edge/Lincoln MKZ is the only real competitor among domestics, and it's a little jittery on the road. Lexus RX350 is equal to the Enclave but a lot more money, and I couldn't find a new (2008) Highlander anywhere to compare.  So take a look at the Enclave: you'll be impressed.","Very comfortable, precise handling, excellent build quality.",Larger outside mirrors.
4.75,Better than the rest by a wide margin,budi ,09/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"This vehicle does so many things well. I looked at a lot of vehicles before choosing the Enclave. Other 3 row CUV's do not match up to the Enclave's value, refinement, reliability, usability (storage capacity/passenger room and comfort) Car has good acceleration for a vehicle its size and role as a luxury family hauler. The vehicle cools down quickly. You can access the third row from both sides of the car unlike the MDX and you don't have to be a contortionist. It has plenty of room behind the 3rd row for a stroller and cooler. I could go on and on.","Smooth quite ride. OnStar, Runs on 87 octane. backup sensors.

5,Beats a BMW,Chuck ,09/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Looked for a replacement for my BMW SUV. The Enclave caught my eye with its sleek design, stylish interior. The fit and finish is first class, the engineering is current, and the price is $15 to $20 below the BMW. First new American car I've gotten for myself in almost 40 years. Not your grandfather's Buick! Will help bring quality reputation back to the marque. ","Quiet, quiet and smooth. Roomy comfortable front seats. Every feature you could want at hand. Lots of storage everywhere. Like the captain's chairs in back, and even the third row is suprisingly comfortable. Everything folds down fast and easy for carrying things. A great-looking car.

OnStar does everything the nav does and has significant safety benefits as well. My 9 year old had the rear audio wireless system operational in minutes! The engine is smooth and pleasingly powerful. The exhaust note is perfect. The cabin is exemplary, with outstanding switchgear that has excellent tactile feel. Interior lighting is superb. The ""Googley-Eyed"" Bi-Zenon articulating headlamps light to the horizon. I traded in a '04 Sequoia: I could hardly read the dash in any lighting. Enclave's dash is the new benchmark. What? No red line on the tach? This car is one sexy station wagon: The Real Roadmaster","Fob controls liftgate and remotely starts the car/fires up climate control & the heated seats. Heated washer fluid with outstanding spray pattern on windshield. Driver Info Center shows tire pressures & slew of programmable features. And don't forget Elmer Fudd: this puppy is vewy, vewy quiet.","That darn transmission. It shifts impeccably, but I bet I'm losing an MPG or two by having to jab it just right to get it to downshift. Nothing screams ""Reprogram the Tranny"" like a cruise control that dips a full 3-4 mph on a moderate hill before it self- corrects. No dedicated sunglasses holder."
5,"Style, comfort, performance from USA",McD ,08/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was always looking at imports but held off buying once I saw the concept for the Enclave. Glad I waited. Love the comfort, ride, many features. Even my 5'4"" wife is liking it despite its size. The backup camera makes it easy to back up without fear of hitting anything. We have put 7,000 miles on it in 3 months.",Backup camera is terrific and the Navigation system is fabulous.

I had considered the Lexus and Acura, but believe the Ecncave blows them away.  It also puts the Mercedes to shame, and at a lesser cost!  My only complaint is the lack of smoothness in the transmission, but based on all of it's attributes I can forgive this slight flaw.

The Cadillac design was impratical and designed poorly. The Buick Enclave is a breath of fresh air. I love that not only does it look great- it functionality and practicality rivals any minivan.

We finally got to see the Enclave and it was truly spectactular. We just had a hard time finding one to buy. People come up to us all of the time and want to see the car and want to know about it!  I have only had Lincoln Continentals for the past 20 years, so this was a big step to buy a Buick. We have not been dissapointed. It is actully shorter and narrower than my Lincoln (more room in the garage!)","The captain chairs in the back, the power liftgate, the interior lighting and the headlights that follow as the car turns.

The Buick's quality is superior to Acura.  No rattles, no issues.  It's the most comfortable car I've ever had. If GM pays attention to design and quality like it did with the Enclave, it will begin to compete again.","Comfortable seats, smooth and ultra quiet ride. Great looking.  Lots of room.",Higher grade plastics. DVD audio and 5.1 surround should be included in the base navigation/radio system. It can't really cost that much more to build in.

I test drove most of the SUVs in the  mid and large sections. I was very surprised to find that the Buick Enclave had fantastic handling and good gas mpg(for its size). It is a beautiful and logical car making it easy and fun to drive. The large capacity is perfect for all the members of my family, most of them being very tall. It is larger than most of the big truck SUVs, but it drives like a car.  I have never considered owning an American car before.  I must say, I love my new Buick Enclave!  It is a quality car that comfortably fits seven people for a much lower price than the Acura or Lexus.","Leg room, very comfortable front seats, logical design inside and out, low gas usage for being a large SUV, comfortable and easy to reach third row seat, very quiet ride, good crash testing, and easy to use navigation system.

I find the power to be more than enough and can tow 4500 pounds with the towing package. I don't need a V8 and don't want to sacrifice the milelage. I traded in a Honda for a Buick...I would never had believed that was possible.  I could not be more pleased.

5,First Impressions,Frank ,08/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,After 15 years of European cars we finally found a US built vehicle we wanted to own. After a test drive we knew something great had finally come from GM. It was like a jumbo MDX that made a first impression so quiet we could actually talk and enjoy the music. Handling is that of a sedan half the size and seating is second to nothing we ever owned.  We were not in the market for a car but had gone to the dealer for an upgrade to an OnStar system when we saw it. Two days later we took it home. For the first time in my life I got a new car with nothing to fix right from the dealer.,"Seating, great looks, safety features. 5 star ratings, anti lock, stability control, traction control, air bags for all seating positions, HID headlights w/steering and super quiet. Nothing this large has ever driven so well. And $10,000 less than my sister's MDX",I would like better gas mileage but it already gets better mileage than even smaller SUVs on regular fuel. So I guess I want more just like everyone else.
5,Best on the Lot,bioedwards ,07/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After driving may competing alternative vehicles, the Enclave out classed them all. Although it took 4 months to get, it was worth the wait. Every aspect of the Enclave is very satisfying. It is obvious from many ""minor"" details that much engineering went into the development of the car. As the owner of 4 Buicks prior to this one, it is the best I've driven in 20 years. The car seems bigger once inside that it appears from the outside, yet it drives nimbly. Anyone that wants a vehicle to carry more than 4 people comfortably needs to drive the Enclave before purchasing any other vehicle. Great Job Buick!","Quiet smooth ride, roominess and comfort inside, attention to detail throughout, the new lights and big windshield give a great view of the road even at night",Steering wheel needs to go higher for taller people.

The trip gave us a chance to try all the bells and whistles. The car is loaded with everything (more than we orignally wanted) but with limited dealship inventory, we took what was available. Trip included multiple mtn. passes with elevation over 10k ft., and as high as 12k. We got 24.6 MPG overall, which I thought was great considering the terrain driven. Often when we returned from a hike or train ride we found people gathered around the car in the parking lot admiring it. We researched a lot of cross-over models, and we think we made the right choice. ","Size,comfort and quite ride. Jewel Red Tintcoat color.

It didn't hurt that the Enclave is quieter than the X5 and offers comparable features for $18K less. I drive a 5 series BMW so I was kind of rooting for the X5 but I find myself enjoying the Enclave more than I imagined. It does everything in a smooth and refined way.

The lighting, at night, reflects onto the console making it look illuminated and easy to find items. It feels like a quality Lexus I just hope Buick got the reliability to go with this fine product.","Upgrade the very cheap handles on the second row seats used to tip them forward. It really detracts from the vehicle. Feel really flimsy. Carry wood trim over the lower dash would really add zip. Getting used to the 6 speed transmission, can bog down on hills, got to push it. OnStar antenna hits garage door"
4.625,Best Buick in Years,PA_Dave ,06/15/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,5,4,"My last car was an Infinti G35 coupe, and I traded it for a Blue CXL FWD two weeks ago and love it. They should have called it a Roadmaster: Quiet comfortable cabin, great styling, tons of room, plenty of pep, very smooth over bumps even with 19"" rims (if you keep the tire pressure at 32 fr/30 rr). Excellent handling for a big SUV, much better than the Trailblazer I rented last year. So far gas mileage is not bad, 19-20 in mostly city driving, 24 on a short hwy run. Only rarely noticed trans downshift issue reported in mag reviews, but the terrain is pretty flat here. ","Seats, power hatch, backup warning sensor, smooth quiet ride, easy access to 3rd row, Bose stereo sounds great.",Power shade for front sunroof. Sport package with a V8 and 3.42 gears would be sweet.
4.75,"An awesome, upscale joy to own!",Dan ,06/14/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"Lots of research went into our choice of the Enclave. We have not been disappointed!  It is a joy to drive, offering super quiet interior and ride, plush CXL leather seating, Bose speaker system, handles fantastic on the road. We towed our boat this weekend, and it handled it better than my previous SUV, hands down. A lot of thought went into this vehicle. We're getting better than stated gas mileage, which is a nice surprise!  ","This vehicle is loaded with safety features, including airbags everywhere. All three rows of seating are comfortable, with the third row of seating easy to reach, thanks to fold up and out of the way second seats!  The vehicle is fun to drive, and we'd buy it again!","One improvement we'd like to see, is easier to control window buttons. It is hard to stop the window at the level you wish.  Another improvement I'd like is to have some sort of a drip edge above the doors."
4.875,Excellent Design - Excellent Performance,MB ,06/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The crossover is well designed, is living-room quiet, and handles very well. Fit and finish is excellent and there are no rattles or squeaks. The ride quality is superb. ","The excellent seats, including the second row captains seats and the roomy third row seating. The Bose stereo system is awesome.",
4.5,"""American Built"" finally means something",It's a Buick ,06/12/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,3,5,"This is my second American vehicle and have to say this time I'm very pleased with it so far. Very quiet and plush ride. The handling isn't bad either for a 2 and 1/2 ton vehicle. The overall apperance is on a par with other luxury vehicles. Even though, I wasn't loooking for performance, the MPG is below average and transmission slow to change when pushed, but smooth. Some of the materials used looks a little cheap and outdated. Some of the technology is below that of its competitors. Reliability is in question, but only time will tell. Overall, I would recommend this vehicle. ","The luxury look, feel, and ride. Adaptive headlights, and the Bose system.","One touch windows to all of the them, improve or replace some of the cheap and outdated plastic and controls, update the technology of the stereo/nav system (check with Lexus), add XM Live Traffic, cooled/heated seats to all, better leather for the seats, and ability to open rear window."
5,Fantastic first week!,EMG ,06/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just got our new Enclave and couldn't be happier. Had many more ""bells and whistles"" than we even knew about going in!  Such a quiet ride, very solid feel. Decent pick-up on the freeway, but it's not a sports car. Perfect car for a family who needs a mini-van but doesn't want to get one. Very comparable to higher-end SUVs. Would highly recommend a close look at the Enclave to any family with three or more children.","Sunroof, captains chairs for second row, body styling.","Only negative is the somewhat awkward center console storage area, but I've gotten used to it. "
4.875,Our Buick,Joel & Alli ,06/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We have had the Enclave CXL for three weeks and simply love it. After test driving the Enclave, we quickly discovered it rides smoother and is much quieter then the Acadia and Outlook. The interior is very comfortable with ample room for 7. Although the engine is not a rocket, the 275 HP is plenty for its size and weight.  The 6 speed transmission is smooth.  Enclave gets 1 less mpg then the Acadia and Outlook maybe because it's a little heavier. But at least it runs on 87 octane. Glad we looked at the Enclave as we almost bought the Acadia or Outlook. Some people may prefer the looks of the Acadia or Outlook, but the ride and quietness of Enclave can't be beat.",Interior/Exterior design. Interior comfort. Ride and quietness. Entertainment/Navigation system. Great towing ability. Two sunroofs. Cargo capacity,Better fuel efficiency. Heated rear seats. Full size spare 
5,Never buy a minivan again!,Steve S. ,06/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This vehicle is really impressive. I think GM has finally got it right. The vehicle is so comfortable, with so many nice features. You have to drive a Lambda based GM before you buy another SUV, crossover, or minivan. ","Navigation, rear view monitor, Aux. jack for MP3, DVD player.  The spaciousness for all, including a 3rd row that adults can sit in! Great gas mileage for a 7/8 passenger! ","Heated 2nd row seats, cooled front row seats, adjustable pedals."
4.75,'08 CXL AWD Blue-Gold,rrtke ,05/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I didn't think I would ever go back to a GM product. We traded in an '04 Toyota Sienna. The van was very nice but between the hesitation and the run flat tires, it certainly was not perfect as some would lead you to believe. The new Enclave is fantastic.  Great room, quiet, and very comfortable.  ","The blue-gold paint. Rear camera, comfort, XM radio, chrome wheels. Power tilt and telescope wheel, Bose stereo.","Cooled seats, auto up and down for all windows. Power shade for front roof as well. Some areas still suffer from cheaper plastic parts."
4.625,Is this a Buick?,Jody ,05/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"After much searching in this price range, my wife and I were settled on the Acadia. However, we took one test drive in the new Buick and were amazed at how much better looking and how much better equipped the Enclave is compared to the Acadia. The ride is smooth and quiet with nice accleration from the six speed automatic. The Buick is not going to snap your neck with speed, but is perfectly capable of quick passing maneuvers when needed.  The interior is what really impressed us. My wife and I are in our late 20's and have never considered a Buick until now. The clock in the dash looks great and at night the interior lighting befits a much higher priced car.  ","Standard Bi-Xenon's, power rear liftgate and 18 inch wheels on CX.  Cloth seats in our CX are very comfortable and in Black look great.  ",Throw out what you might have thought a Buick was and take a test drive.  
4.875,CXL,BillyG ,05/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Most quiet/comfortable vehicle have ever owned.  Looking forward to long trip. Gold Mist Metallic is an awesome color. Mileage on par with an Acura MDX, Lexus 350 without premium fuel. Put those marques on this vehicle and they would be proud.",Comfort and quietness. Imperceptable road noise.,Nothing I can think of. Jury still out on actual mileage
5,Buick Enclave,mkhinck ,05/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife had to get the Buick Enclave. We looked at the GMC Acadia and Saturn Outlook. We just about purchased the Outlook and then found an Enclave that just came into the dealership. Hard to believe that this is a Buick. Finally a reasonably priced car that isn't a minivan and fits our family of 7.  Believe it or not my wife hated our Escalade, too big. Now she doesn't have to drive the giant bling bling to fit our family.  For the price a much better choice than the Acadia or Outlook.  Buick did a good job.","Adaptive headlights, DVD player, navigation, rear parking camera, dual skyroof","Air conditioned seats, ability to open rear window glass and/or tailgate instead of just tailgate."
4.625,Just Drove Away with My New Enclave!,kenclave ,04/28/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I have never owned a GM vehicle. I have been waiting for this one since its debut at the Detroit Auto Show. Almost bought an Acadia because they came out first and I was chomping at the bit. Am so glad I was patient. It was well worth it.  Drives beautifully. Very quiet. Very smooth. Handling is quite responsive. Feels very solid and safe.  Looks great. Interior is nice. Plenty of room in all three rows. Traded in a Chrysler Town & Country that I loved. No regrets. Only the third day of my ownership, but so far I am quite pleased. Looking for excuses to drive!",Dual sunroof. Stabilitrak-stability control. All of the airbags/cushions. Power liftgate. Smart slide seating. Ease of dropping back bench to flat & 2nd row up for 3rd row entry. The steering wheel (sounds crazy -- but I actually do love the steering wheel -- the way it looks and the way it feels).,"Wish that there was more of the wood finish around the stereo unit. Would have classed up interior even more. Leather seats are very nice -- wish they were more substantial -- again, would have classed it up even more. Skyroof sun shades: power in back, manual shade in front. Why not both power?"
