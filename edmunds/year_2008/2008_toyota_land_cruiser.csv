5,The beast!,wjb ,11/18/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This vehicle has far exceeded my expectations. It's sold as a rock. I feel sorry for anyone who gets into an accident with the vehicle as you would surely be the loser. It was made for inclement weather. ,"Safety, its the complete package. feels like a military capable machine.",Power lift gate and disappearing 3rd row seating when extra room is needed. Side molding standard.
4.25,The best of its class,Alex ,08/12/2010,,,5,5,2,4,,5,5,3,5,"Despite the issues we have with our truck, it is the best track in its class as far as exterior design, power and the way it drives - there is no other vehicle that I could compare LC200 to; The issues we had/have are the drive shaft that had to be replaced because it was factory or design defect (even this particular vehicle was built in Japan). Secondly, I already replaced the belt: around 20,000 miles it started making a noise; thirdly every other time I lift this truck to rotate tires (I like to do a simple maintenance myself), after I need to take it to the dealer to recalibrate suspension as it starts lining to the right. Other than that it's perfect!",,"not sure if that has already been fixed in newer models, but they need to fix problems I describe above. Also for this price I would except a lot more cool features."
5,The Beast,WB ,11/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just returned from a trip and drove 75-80mph 90% of the time and got 19.74 MPG! I was over 20 mpg for a while. I didn't believe the electronic readout that showed 19.4 when I stopped for fuel as the low fuel light had come on, I used 19 gals of fuel and still had 6 gals left and put 380 miles on it and I could've gone nearly 500 miles on a tank - WOW. Around town I get around 14-15 MPG. But it weighs nearly 3 tons. This thing is solid and the vehicle I'd want to be in an accident in. I'd feel sorry for the other guy.","Solid, quiet, Nav system, 4 Zone A/C, Heated rear seats and entertainment center.",Take 3 row seats out if needed. 
4.875,Best SUV  I ever had,Phil Wilson ,12/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is my 3rd LC and so far this is the best and most powerful of the three.its fun to drive and my wife approves it to be the best of the LC I have own. I had an 05, 06 . It is well built and solid. I will go on a long trip anytime with this vehicle.","Smart key, remote start, DVD/nav. and very quiet ride instrumentation are great and easy to read, blue tooth is wonderful.","Privacy windows, adjustable suspension,laser cruise control and for the price we paid, it should come with power 3rd seat and power rear door."
4.875,Literally Rock Solid,KJB ,09/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I now understand the reviewers that describe this SUV as being carved out of a single slab of granite.  You have to drive one to experience it.  Every handle, button, lever feels precise, solid, and overengineered to perfection.  The powertrain makes this land crusher incredibly fun to drive.  The vehicle just oozes quality and has all the latest electronic gizmos to boot.  It's not for everyone but if you can appreciate quality over quality and your know what this vehicle is made to do then you cannot go wrong with the TLC.  ","power train, smart key, the smooth suspension, KDSS, crawl control","add laser cruise control, privacy glass, and include body side moldings"
3.875,Nice SUV,Mark Slepicka ,08/22/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,3,4,Stable on road and off with plenty of power and braking. Would like to see front console cup holder lighting for night time driving and overhead spotlight buttons lit also. I am getting 17.2 mpg city/hwy combined using premium. exterior sheet metal seems to be a little thin. I started to notice a clunk from the rear when starting from a dead stop and also when coming to a stop. I went to my Toyota dealer and found out a (TSB) Technical Service Bulletin was issued on this problem. The fix was to replace the drive shaft under drivetrain warranty at no cost. After replacement of shaft i have had no further problem. Overall the new Land Cruiser is solid and performs well! ,With 5000 miles on my cruiser I am happy to say I have no squeaks or rattles which I believe is all in the fit and finish with quality materials.,removable 3rd row seats

5,"A true ""Flagship""",Luckyone ,01/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My experience with this vehicle is limited (500 miles), however what a great, powerful, solid, comfortable, well-built, technologicially superior, cutting edge, handsome ""BEAST"". Toyota improved on not only the previous generation, but other leading all-wheel drive brands that I examined. I'm very satisfied with the vehicle so far.","The engine power, 4 zone climate control, the navigation,cooler box, rear dvd package, the ""balanced"" suspention gives excellent ride quality.","More interior storage, ""fold-flat"" third-row, gas mileage could be better"
4.625,Impressive,octav ,12/26/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"All I can hope is to have the time to experience all the capability of this truck. Within a day of the purchase, I found myself planning trips that I hadn't been on since I sold my Tacoma 4x4 in 2001. This is a huge truck that drives impeccably. The fit and finish is superb. The kids love the rear seat entertainment system.","Excellent ride on and off road. Excellent acceleration, I feel that I am in a sport car (other than the cornering).","Privacy windows in the back. No height adjustment, perhaps Toyota is saving this feature for the upcoming LX 570."
4.875,Love my new 2008 LC,bulabarry ,12/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Traded in my 2000 LC for 2008 LC.  I also own a 2004 LC.  I like everything about the 08 LC (including the new design). I tow a large boat that was a problem for my 2000 LC - not a problem with the 08!  The 08 has better power, handling, off-road capabilities, more rugged, really sharp looking interior (and exterior).  To me the 08 is worth every penny.",To me this is a more hardened and more powerful version of LC with better fit & finish than any other LC to date.  I am open-minded & really like the new styling.,"I would like for the 3rd row seats to be removable, but they can be deployed much faster than previous LC - a trade-off I guess."
4.5,As good as it gets,ddavis ,12/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,1,5,This is my 5th land cruiser and the very best. I will not let it go. My wife will get it once in a blue moon.  ,This suv is tight in every way without leaving out comfort. ,Nicer wheels would make this toyota an 11.
2.375,No personality,graylc ,11/30/2007,,,1,1,3,3,,4,3,1,3,"This vehicle is not what we were hoping for. No personality, no character, very poor instrumentation design, exterior styling that is non-existent. It is a carbon copy of a Highlander, and you can buy two of those for one of these. Wait for the next redesign.",Big V8 Big brakes,"Redesign the exterior;no character Redesign the interior, particularly the instrument panel, get rid of the clutsy tumbler glass tunnels over the speedo and tach. Place the auxilary gauges in a symmetrical layout, not spread about here and there. Make the Nav screen rotate a few degrees left/righ"
4.125,2008 Land Cruiser,Nancy ,11/25/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,2,5,This is my 3rd Land Cruiser in 9 years. The 08 feels very heavy and solid. It is a great drive and looks great too. It feels a little truck like but overall I'm happy to drive it.,The navigation system us very user friendly. The cooler box is cool and the whole computer system is great if you can figure out how to use it all. Heated back seats.,Missing front seat arm rests. Not enough storage in console or front area for stuff. The 3rd row seats should be electronic as well as the back door.
5,2008 Land Cruiser,2008 Land Cruiser ,11/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was overwhelmed with smoothness and quietness of the vehicle.  My family was overjoyed with it.  My previous vehicle was 2004 Totoyo Sequoia which was also great, but the Land Cruiser is the better one.","Display monitor with fancy buttons, maps, GPS, and much more.",None
