3,Made a bad choice,Dave H ,09/09/2015,3,3,4,,,2,3,3,4,,,"Purchased the vehicle with 80,000 miles on the odometer.  Drove off the lot and the next morning discovered a problem.  After the car sits for an hour or more when you starting and put it into into gear the car rough idles and jerks.  I took the car back to the local VW dealer where I bought it.  The first repair attempt took 3 weeks because the dealer had now idea what the cause of the problem was.  They called the VW corporate tech support who told them to replace some part.  Did not solve the problem, but I got to pay $650 for the attempted repair.  The car is back in the shop (1 week now).  They still have no idea.",,
3,Maintenance is rough... but Lovely Look and Ride,Heather ,07/29/2015,2,4,3,,,1,4,4,4,,,"I purchased my Touareg used with just 50K miles. I was so impressed by the style, handling and features. I am short, 5' and I can see out of this SUV perfectly. I can get in and out and the seat adjusts wonderfully. It has nice appointments like a sun roof, leather seats, and rear heat and air. All of these bells and whistles; however, are costly to maintain and fix. Let's start with the smaller issues. The headlights frequently go out. They are $25 each and a major pain to install. As soon as I bought the car, it had to have a complete break job. $750. Some more major issues have included the radiator caps breaking and causing leaks and the transmission fluid lines breaking. The most major repair was the Drivetrain which went out at 65K. Had I not had the extended warranty it would have cost between $2,500-$3,000 to fix. Overall I love Volkswagens, and I love this car. My suggestion would be to buy with a warranty. Be aware that the maintenance costs are in line with any premium brand - Audi, Mercedes, BMW.",,
4,No Coincidence!!,TFH ,07/11/2015,1,4,4,,,1,5,4,4,,,"My 2008 Touareg 2 was in excellent condition, well maintained and well within a reasonable amount of miles. Minimum wear and tear. On July 3,2015 at just over 100k the drive shaft broke down!! ! 100k miles I said! Two days prior, I had performed an oil change and service at a local VW dealership located in Charleston SC. At 600 miles over 100k, the car crapped on me. I bought the vehicle used with under 40k miles and in certified pre owned condition(2012). Since then, I have had nothing but headaches and nightmares with what should be considered minor routine maintenance at the VW dealerships. Horn, Side view mirror, wipers, tire pressure sensors, airbag sensors, brakes, tires, headlight bulbs. You will not find a reliable VW dealership capable of servicing these basic needs. And if you do, prepare to spend and arm and a leg and tremendous amounts of time waiting! I have filed several claims with VW America who by the way in my opinion does a poor job standing behind their product. By the time I was finished cursing and screaming at anyone who came across my path, I was told the repairs would cost $1500.00 to repair. Remember now, the drivetrain warranty expired at 100k miles! A really hard and expensive reality to face. What to do? What places the mind goes when coincidence's like these occur unexpectedly. On top of no sense of urgency from the people who manufacture the product. Looking back on my experiences, I would advise anyone considering this vehicle to purchase as close to new as possible, if not, purchase the extended warranty. Other than that, find a German car specialist who has experience with these type of vehicles. I regret getting rid of  my Touareg in many ways however, the quality of the vehicle is undermined by both the dealerships inability to service and the manufacturer!",,

After 36 months, the dealership finally showed me how to reset it myself. I was very disappointed by the $1k brake job and $600 tire replacement at 25K miles. This made my ""affordable"" lease payment not so affordable. I wasn't really expecting to put any maintenance costs into it for the first three years. I have loved driving this car. The base T2 is very nicely loaded, but I am happy to turn it in before anything else wears out. I will be switching to something with lower maintenance costs.","Great ride, beautiful styling!

My Touareg has not disappointed.   Any time I need a little extra power, I just throw her into Sport and take off.  Is she as fast as my TT?  No, but I don't expect that out of a SUV.

Volkswagen designed this to be one of the best off-roaders in the world, while providing exceptional comfort on the road. The 4x4 system is unmatched by anyone in its class and it WILL get you there and back in comfort. This is also one of the safest SUVs on the market. It is over engineered through and through. It may not be the roomiest, cheapest or most readily available but that is not what its built for. Get a Suburban for that. The Touareg mixes a blend of comfort, high class quality, luxury and unmatched off road prowess that very few SUVs on the road even come close. ","The stellar off road capabilities, truly great. Composed on the road and fantastic quality. Safety and good looks, ours has the optional 19"" wheels which add to the appeal. AFS bi-xenon headlights. The optional Dynaudio sound system is very good.

Then the first time I needed the AWD to get thru some snow/ice for work, the alternator went out (23K miles).Of course VW doesn't have repair parts in the US, so I had to wait 10 days for the alternator (actually a generator) to be shipped from Germany.

For starters, insufficient interior storage- be it for your cell, sunglasses or misc supplies (definitely not a mom friendly car). The owners manual is HUGE, poorly written and time consuming to find what you are looking for and you will be looking. And it lacks basic answers. ""Warning"" lights are a constant. Needed new brake pads at 12k miles- $600 bucks! An oil change is $100+ and gas, OMG! Also, this car is not intuitive- things are not where they should be and I find driving it annoying on most days.

Don't waste money on the V8, the V6 runs fantastic. Interior gadgets make trips even more enjoyable. Some bad: VW should put on much better tires than the Pirelli Scorpion. Road noise is completely unacceptable when the vehicle approaches the 20K mark. Watch for transmission problems. The first time it was a electrical sensor that prevented the car from upshifting from 1st. It took the dealer a week to figure that one out.

The interior quality is first-rate, with high quality materials, and fit and finish that is really precise. The sound system produces very clear, crisp sound. The Touareg drives very comfortably and smoothly, and steers precisely. It's a vast improvement over the 1997 Chevy Tahoe we bought it to replace. The earlier Touaregs had a reputation for mediocre reliability, especially with the electrical system, so I'm hoping VW fixed the problems with this updated Touareg 2.","Love the air suspension, heated seats, four-zone A/C control, the headlights that turn with the car. . .

Gas mileage has been 19-20 and 26 gallon gas tank comes in handy.  Ride is very much softer than other SUVs I've had (Pathfinder, Rodeo) and certainly much softer than my A4 so if you're expecting a tight German ride you won't get it in a Touareg.

The leather seats are very comfortable, and the rest of the cabin is nicely trimmed. The navigation system works great. The Touareg 2 is great for off-roading, and is still agile in city driving.

4.375,Great SUV for your money,harumy k ,08/21/2007,,,3,4,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I had been looking around for an SUV since May 2007. I was looking for reliable SUV, preferably a hybrid since you get more miles for your money. I went to check out the Lexus RX 450, Toyota Highlander and the Touareg2. Since I previously had owned an 03 Jetta and since I never had any problems with the car, I thought of checking out the Volkswagen Touareg2. As soon I sat in the SUV, I knew it was the one for me. It was very comfortable inside and I loved how the outside looked. Compared to the other SUVs in the market, this one had more room inside and I felt safe.","I purchased the SUV w/ the Lux package. I love the fact that both passenger and driver had power seats. I also loved the automatic windshield wipers, which are great because as soon as any water hits the windshield, the wipers come on; thus you don't need to worry about this while driving.",The only thing I would like the SUV to have is Bluetooth.
