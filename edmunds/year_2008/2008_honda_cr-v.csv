2,"Loved it...until it hit 60,000 miles :(",Sharon ,07/26/2016,,,3,,,,,3,4,,,"I bought a 2008 CR-V brand new, straight off the boat, and loved it.  Friends, family, and coworkers had CR-Vs, and loved theirs also, until they all started to get hit by the ""A/C gremlin"" in about 2012-2014 - Complete A/C failure in sister-in-law's 2007 CR-V, friend's 2008 CR-V, and coworker's 2007 CR-V AND his 2009 CR-V!  And they were NOT cheap repairs (except for my coworker's 2009 CR-V, which was still under warranty).  Me?  I got hit with rack & pinion failure -  at 60,000 miles, just like many other reviewers on the internet.  Estimated repair cost $2,100 !!!   Honda gave me a bottle of power steering fluid and said ""just keep topping it off until you can afford to fix it.""  But when I researched it on the internet, I found this is quite a common problem, and one with a fix that apparently does not last long.  So rather than dump $2,000 into fixing the power steering leak which is known to be a recurring failure once you get it, I dumped the car altogether.  Hondas are supposed to last - I bought it because I thought they had a reputation for long term reliability.  60,000 is NOT LONG-term, IMO.  I hated feeling like I was sitting on a ticking time bomb, with $2,000 possible repairs with every oil change (and Honda would NOT help, despite knowing rack & pinion failure was a common problem).  The original plan was to keep the CR-V until my daughter turned 16 (last month), then give it to her (and buy a new car for myself).  Instead, I dumped the CR-V last year and bought a new Subaru Forrester.   And now that I read about the failure in the locks, I feel reassured I made the right decision, because my CR-Vs locks always made strange noises, tho they had not failed....yet.  I'm sure it was just a matter of time before they failed.  Same with the A/C.  I'm now looking for a RELIABLE used car for my 16 year old, and you can bet it will NOT be a CR-V :/",,

Now, at 84k, there's another issue with the power steering fluid leaking and the rack and pinion is to blame again! I thought I'd be getting long-lasting quality as advertised but I'm left sorely disappointed. Especially, after overlooking petty things like road noise, uncomfortable seats, and cheap materials.

Finally solved the problem by having upper control arms added to rear wheels and now have a new set of Michelin Defender tires and good wheel alignment.  Power door locks have been a problem.

3,Disappointed in Honda,randyhi ,08/10/2013,,,3,3,2,3,,4,3,3,3,"I bought this CRV new and at 50,000 miles I was told by the local service dept that it now needs new tie rod ends, ball joints, and bushings. The poor thing has been used on the highway and in town and has rarely been on anything other than a paved road. I just got the quote for these repairs and it is just a little over $800. I have never seen a vehicle have suspension and steering problems arise this soon unless it had been subjected to serious off road use. Mine has not. It has a weak engine that struggles on hills and is best owned and driven in the flatlands. I bought a Honda for their reliability and am very disappointed with the issues at only 50K miles.","Fair gas mileage, quiet engine.","Their is a definite need to repair the door lock glitch that causes the thing to lock and unlock while driving down the road. It is a very annoying anomaly that could get someone hurt in an emergency situation.

Purchased as a CPO vehicle and had one issue, A/C clutch was on it's way out after 10k miles of my ownership. Covered under warranty. Ride is firm but that is ok with me as I like a firm ride. Buttons on steering wheel are OK. Wish there was a scan feature for radio like one of my other vehicles has. CRV handles well in rain, light snow. AWD is allright for what is. Kids like the sliding rear seats so they can adjust as they like (believe that is no longer available on new ones). Rear seat recline feature is good also. Decent cargo capacity for travel.","Like the firm ride. Also, while some folks have said it is noisy inside, I can't really comment on that as the vehicle I also drive periodically (Z71 truck with AT tires) is a bit noisy. Good headroom, I'm 6' and so is my spouse. Mileage is good.
I get 19-20 in straight in-town driving depending on traffic. About 25 for my commute (17 miles one way, 12 of that is highway). Best mileage on a trip was 28.5 with AC on, cruise set on 72. Figured mileage the old fashioned way, miles driven by gallons used to fill it up. Computer estimate is off. Holds a decent amount of luggage for trips. No trouble keeping up with traffic or passing, even in mountains in N. Carolina.","Seems like AC is a bit problematic on CRV's. Hoping the clutch failure on this one is a one time thing. Carpet is interesting. Seems thin. Also, replaced the carpeted floor mats that were new when I purchased this CPO vehicle for Honda all-weather mats as the carpeted mats started ""pilling"" up within about 3 weeks of my buying the vehicle. While I find the seats comfortable, it would be nice if there were additional adjustments available on the non-powered seats similar to the power seats on the EX-L.

I agree with other reviewers about the poor quality tires that came on the vehicle...they had to be replaced far sooner than any on any other car I've ever had. I replaced them with Cooper CS 4s and have been very happy.  The CR-V is fantastic on ice and in snow.

I'd probably be driving it still but my wife attacked a tree with it.  She survived the collision with no injury but the crash was fatal for the car. The CRV is everything the wagon was and more.

On the down side, the tires that come with it are garbage and several people have had to replace them after only one year, including us.  The folding rear seats are a VERY poor design.  They wad up behind the front seats and give you almost no extra room.  Honda designers should take some tips from Rav4 rear seats and have them fold once, and completely flat.  Also, the hatchback, when opened, can drip muddy snow and rain.","fuel economy, appearance, AC, CC and power everything even on base model, good for 3 passengers in back (no hump in floor)","Needs to come with better tires, center console and the way the rear seats fold to be redesigned."

The vehicle is exhibiting an annoying vibration at speeds between 85 and 110 k/hr.  Dealer in conj. with Honda unable to correct.  Honda says that no defect exists although they have a name for the condition - harmonic tingle.  Apparently many other CR-Vs have same problem.  I tried a brand new 90 and it had the same problem.

I brought it to the Dealership to check out a Grinding Noise that happened when I hit the brakes. The dealership told me that my CRV need front and rear rotors and front and rear pads. I have never ever had to replace Rotors or pads at 29000 miles in my whole life. This Cost me over $1100.00. I feel that Honda should have a recall.

Our old Subaru Legacy gave us both back aches in 15 minutes of driving. With the Honda CRV we drove for 13 hours pain free! We love the leather seats and seat warmers, but for those who need support the armrests are fantastic! We debated leather - to go with the all leather or not. So glad we did. It's fun to drive.

5,I'd buy it again,Matt ,06/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife bought an LX AWD, and I ended up liking it so much, I traded in my Expedition (kids got older; didn't need all the space anymore) and got an LX AWD too.  It is sturdy, reliable, solid, safe and quiet.  It also has all the safety features of the highest end Honda (we like that about Hondas). I mostly drive in the city, jumping on and off the interstate on occasion, and I average about 22-23 mpg.  On highway trips, I get 26-28 mpg. The best words to describe our Hondas are basic (in the best sense of the word) and solid. They have everything you need (including the AWD and ABS for snow/ice) without all the extra bells and whistles and related cost. Also, no worries and no problems. ","Air bags all around. AWD and ABS for snow and ice is key.  Cruise control is easy to understand and use.  Love the displays - easy to follow and shows current mpg and average mpg. Big driver's side wiper works great, even with snow and slush. Price is fair; friend got Volvo SUV and we got two CRVs. ","Nothing about this car leaves you wondering, ""What were they thinking?""  I wish it came with heated mirrors, though. Not real powerful but powerful enough to get on and off the interstate easily and pass safely. The price you pay for good mpg.

Cruise control really helps w/ the gas too. I really enjoy the car. It is not like driving a Mercedes or something but most of us don't anyway so big deal. It has great room and the seats are comfortable. Totally worth what I paid and reliable. Some people may just not be satisfied or don't tell the whole truth. ,Plug in for the ipod and hidden compartments. Glad the tire is off the back end.,"More AC plug outlets up front. Pockets on the back of the front seats for storage. Get rid of the swing down center divider and get a solid one with a storage compartment. Not worth paying 1500 dollars more for, seriously. "

Ride is jiggly compared to other SUV I had considered. No tinted windows so gets hot! Poor acceleration with AC on which did have probs as well as idiot lights sometimes lighting. Got a lemon... Not happy with power...even the Hyundai is faster (and has a much better ride, though Mercedes heavy feeling).  Needs more storage compartments, no bumper to stand on to get to roof racks... paint chips easily in parking lots... Cute, bought because of reputation. At least it still has 2 years on warranty...

Other than the turning radius which the CRV, and more stability with strong winds and rain, there's not much comparison. I loved my old CRV way better. First, the new CRV struggles with acceleration worse than the old one. The 6 cd changer is placed on the cup holders between the front seats and the cd holders look like old sandwich boxes.  And this structure is permanently attached that if you drop something on its sides, makes for difficult cleaning. There is less head/leg room. Side mirror adjustments were moved. Trunk space is less. No picnic table. The tires gave at 30K miles. So loud too.",Driver seat adjustment mechanism. GPS. Stability with strong winds. Improved with driving on wet roads. Seat warmers.

4.5,Well worth the money,Dan  ,06/06/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"So far I have owned my 2008 CRV for 8 months. After my Mitsubishi Galant was totaled in a fire, I bought this baby. I was surprised how well the vehicle handled, how well the fuel economy was, and how comfortable the interior was. I achieve about 21 mpg in the city on average, while achieving an average of about 28 mpg on the highway. Overall, great vehicle and I certainly recommend it to others. ","Good fuel economy, friendly center stack, easy to use HVAC and radio controls, nice handling, many safety features, peace of mind from solid reputation of reliability. A very solid vehicle at a good price. ",Find some way to suppress loud engine moan during acceleration. More cushioning for seats.

3.25,Great except for gas mileage,Melanie ,06/01/2009,,,4,3,4,5,,4,3,1,2,"I'm surprised in other comments that most people get much better gas mileage than I do.  I get around 17 in town and 24 on the highway, and I don't drive that aggressively.  At first I thought it was winter driving conditions, but it gets about the same in the summer as it does in the winter, regardless of the ethanol in the gas or the snow on the ground.  I'm getting rid of it now that I'm moving to a southern state and will be doing a lot of in-town driving.  It's an okay car and I do like it, but totally not worth the gas- guzzling aspect of it.  One good thing I have to say is that I'm getting a better trade-in value than I had expected.  At least other people think it's a great vehicle.",Hatch-back; stability in the snow!,Gas efficiency!
2.875,Poor plastic choice for interior,Bear ,05/11/2009,,,1,2,4,3,,3,3,4,3,The plastic used in the interior is easily scratched. The luxury model lacks many common feature such as automatic headlights or lumbar support for the passenger. The sun visor does not keep the sun out very well. My wife hates this vehicle. I do not recommend this model. ,,Change interior plastic to a more durable type.
4.75,Practical but Fun,Mike ,05/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"MPG depends.  Oregon uses 10% ethanol. Hwy=26-28.  In non ethanol states Hwy=29-31 (moderate hills and 70 mph). My combined average after 3,000 is 25mpg with 70/30 mix. No race car but smooth and responsive. Visibility is actually good (I wondered). I'm a single man who is very active.  It works great: surfboards on top, bikes fit inside, etc.  There is really a lot of room for the MPG.  For those who think it is too female, get over yourselves - it is a car that does what you want.  I was looking for wagon but US has few / SUV's are too big and inefficient (and many have no inside room).  The Subaru is better AWD but smaller with same MPG and this was over $1000 less.  Works for me.   ",Handling is sporty. Very comfortable including seats (firm but support is good over a longer trip). Was a good value compared to competition. Quiet if road isn't rough. Versatile for active lifestyle. Flat floors. Visibility is good. Sunroof works well (no buffeting). Many small thoughtful touches.,Tires are hard and loud - a real weak point. The roof rack should be designed where crossbars easily come off and on. Gas tank should be 17.5 instead of 15 gal. A little more power would be nice. Low headlight cutoff too low. Would love backseats like the fit. Better sound dampening underneath.
5,I Love My Honda CRV,Dr of Golf ,04/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This has got to be the best Honda that we've ever owned.  The mileage is fantastic for an SUV-type vehicle and the space is great.  The mileage compares to our old Honda Accord.  Our new CRV is fun to drive and we love taking it out on the highway where it gives us about 32 mpg.  We average about 25 mpg in town.  Can't say enough about the great gas mileage and the fun it is to drive.  Best economical car we've ever owned.

CR-V won't thrill with acceleration, but I routinely have 4 adults, a baby, and a load of Costco purchases aboard, and it handles hills and merges just fine.  Nimble handling, good sight lines, excellent brakes. 2008 had several crazy snowstorms in Pacific NW.  CR-V AWD handled quite well, although the stock Bridgestone tires not the greatest and at 32k are almost spent.  Nary a squeak or rattle, except for a whistling sound from the A/C every so often.

In general, it's a very nice car to drive, has decent handling, good mpg for a small SUV, and is very nicely designed.  The power is rather lacking, but it's only a 4 cylinder, and I find myself continuously frustrated that it is only sold as an automatic.  However,  the general reliability, safety, performance, and resale value of CR-Vs made this my first choice because of the arrival of our new baby.

Nevertheless, this is one terrific vehicle, especially at the price of $25,000 for the EX-L. We tested all the best and the CRV was just a clear winner.

I was impressed for what it is, but finally came to terms with what it isn't.  It IS a thoughtful design that is very practical and reliable.  It was NOT a bachelor car.  And I'm a bachelor.  Almost every other CR-V driver I saw was a middle-aged or elderly lady.  I got odd comments and reactions when picking up a date - none of the ego stroking I have gotten from even moderately priced sport sedans.

Love the dash computer which tells you the mpg in real-time. I have driven the car about 400 miles. So far, I am averaging 27-28 mpg in the city. The only thing I do not like so far is there is a shudder/vibration upon applying the brakes. It was particularly bad the first day... it has gotten much better now. Maybe, it was just new brakes.

One year later we're very glad we did so. This car shines due to its dependability (absolutely no problems experienced) and the sheer thoughtfulness that went into its design and construction. Whatever aspect you look at, steering, seating, handling, this car performs diligently whether in-city, or on mountain tracks. There are faster, flashier and more powerful SUVs out there, but I don't know of any other that gives you the great peace of mind that comes with CRV combined with the pleasure of driving such a well-designed and thought-through vehicle.","High seating position, supportive, comfortable seats and great visibility.

We especially enjoy the build quality, the real-time mileage gauges, and gas mileage. Although the stated highway mileage is 27 MPG, I recently achieved 31 MPG with careful driving management.  In spite of the 4 cylinder the CR-V is plenty peppy enough for onramp acceleration.  There is plenty of room in the back for our 6 plus sons.  ","The gauges and trip odometers are nice to use to track your mileage for trips.  Compared to the Rav4, the dash seemed to be a big improvement. The multiple glove boxes are a nice way to keep organized.  The transmission is smooth with no noticeable jerkiness during shifting.  The mileage is great.","The ride can be a bit hard, from what Ive seen, the 2009 model has addressed this.  The seats could stand to be a bit more comfy and its hard to see out of the back when backing up. "
4.125,After the first year.,D07 ,11/21/08 20:31 PM (PST),3,4,4,4,4,4,5,5," This has been the best vehicle I've had. It's balanced in every sense - not too much of anything. The comfort, performance, styling and utility are just right for a small family.  Even with a base LX we have just what is needed to be safe and still keep up with the times. The vehicle exudes solidity, and after a year, nothing rattles. Cruising at 70 mph all day is effortless due to the efficient gearing.  Puttering around town is no chore at all. Cargo capacity is commodious, and most importantly, ALL the seats are comfortable.  Materials are top notch inside and outside and EVERYTHING, inside outside and underneath is seemingly durable and well engineered. Very good braking and handling too.","The rear seat backs are high enough for good support unlike some small SUVs. Rear flat floor is great for the middle rear passenger. Cruising at 60 mph and the engine hums at just 1860 rpm, at 75 mph its barely above 2000 rpm. It's comfortable to cruise long distance. Everything very well put together.",The rear seats could fold flat to make for a flat floor for cargo. 200 hp would be ideal for this vehicle to overcome the loss of performance on steep inclines and overtaking on hilly terrain. Typical concerns of road noise in this Honda are the OEM tires. 
4.875,Whattacar,nuzedit ,11/17/08 11:22 AM (PST),5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5," This is our third CRV (we still have the other two - a 2000 and a 2001) and this is the best yet. Love the styling, fit and finish. Very comfortable even after a 15.5 hour, straight through drive from McAllen, TX, to Albuquerque, NM. Averages between 21 and 23 mpg in town and as much as 31.5 mpg on the road. Our other CRVs were LX models - on a two-wheel drive, the other AWD. Decided to go top of the line this time and feel it is well worth the difference in price. Full well expect to keep this one for up to 10 years. Our 2000 has 158,000 miles and it still running like a champ. We traded in a 2002 Accord on this CRV. The way if figure it. You can't go wrong with Honda.",Great ride for a small SUV. Excellent interior and exterior construction quality. I am loving the built in XM radio. Can't think of much of anything that is NOT a favorite feature.,Wish the passenger seat had the same adjustability as the driver's seat. And a horn that sounded a little less whoosie would be good.
3.625,"Small on the outside, big on the inside",newzie ,11/14/08 18:40 PM (PST),2,4,3,4,4,3,5,4," I purchased the CR-V after looking at the BMW X3 (CPO), Subaru Outback 3.0R, Hyundai Santa Fe, and Saturn Vue.  I was impressed with the build quality and simple straight forward controls.  It isn't the most powerful vehicle but it handles well, and most of the features I wanted at the best price.  I was also surprised that my insurance went down, even though this is a new vehicle.  This is my first Honda product.",The nav is easy to use.  I love the adjustable rear seating.  Everyone comments on how much room they have in the back seat.  I love the two tier cargo area.  It handles very well as well.,"Where's the bluetooth?  RDS for the radio, auto headlights, and rain sensing wipers would be a nice touch.  Since the console is not movable in the EX-L it should extend to the dashboard.  Cargo box under rear floor like Santa Fe. Finally offer some HID headlights and larger wheels as in the UK."
4.75,CRV Excellent,CRV Surprise ,11/12/08 20:24 PM (PST),4,5,5,4,5,5,5,5," Best bang for the buck. A lot of features and a surprising comforting ride. Great on long road trips. Excellent cargo space for smaller families. Great gas mileage around town. Love the viewing angles for the driver, very open. Just the right amount of everything to make this car a great purchase without feeling guilty.","Love the Vehicle assist, safety features, XM, navigation fun to use and of course the ride and fuel savings",For the money I can not see what else they can add except bluetooth.
5,Great Car!,Penny ,11/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love the car! I wanted a small but roomy SUV. After researching and comparing all the midsize SUVs for 4 months,I choose the Honda CRV. There are a lot of standard features that I wanted and would have been optional on the other brands. I feel I made the best decision!","Gas mileage, heated seats, great stereo, the lit up dash board and very roomy!",Windshield wipers should have one more setting for going faster when it's pouring. Also it should have a light that displays low windshield washer fluid.
4.875,CRV - Smaller SUV but Excellent,Mary ,11/09/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Honda CRV is an excellent, smaller SUV. We are a family of four and it suits our needs perfectly. Comfortable seats (my husband is 6' 3"" and the seat adjusts higher or lower), great turning radius, good gas mileage and lots storage in the rear. More importantly very low maintenance! Just keep getting the oil changed and it'll run forever. ","There's a flip up tray btwn. the front seats with two drink holders and two, smaller shallow trays. I use this ALL the time! And, a pull out drink holder under the radio and flip down drink holders in back passenger. Plus, there is a recessed dash on the passenger's side for storage. ","If the newer models have the brake handle below the radio, it needs to be relocated."
4.75,Love the CR-V,Matt ,11/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"After owning this car for three weeks, my wife and I are still looking for excuses to drive somewhere.  I have no idea what the other review with the 'stiff steering wheel' is about.  This car has some of the lightest steering I've ever driven.  I test drove 4 competing brands and the only other I even considered was the Toyota RAV4 because the 4 cylinder had a little more power.  The interior is laid out well, seats are comfy.  The ride is a little stiff over expansion joints, but the trade off is excellent handling in corners. Averaging 23.5 mpg in city driving, 30-33 on the highway.  I will say the sound system could be better.  It just doesn't seem like I can get it adjusted right.",Excellent fit and finish. Well laid-out interior. Comfortable seats. Smooth 5-speed auto trans. Quiet cabin.,Better radio- we have the EX with 6 speakers and it still lacks bass.  Visibility in the rear is compromised due to the rounded-off styling.  
5,CRV EXL fun to drive....,Jimmy Drew ,11/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,  Traded my 2006 Toyota RAV 4 V6 for the 2008 EXL CRV.  While the engine is smaller on the CRV I find it very capable. It cruises at turnpike speeds with no problem.  The fit and finish of the vehicle are superior to the RAV 4.  The riding comfort is much better than the RAV4 and ride is very smooth.  I am extremely pleased with the rear hatch opening on the top rather than on the side and front seats seem to have more room front and back as well as side to side.  This vehicle seems to exhibit a much higher class of material as well as arrangement of the dash and the radio is simply terrific.  I had the JBL system in the RAV4 but the Honda radio is much better. , The ride and the seat comfort and the front seat room as well as the material used are terrific.  Also like the auto air.,   Put the V6 from the RAV4 in the CRV and you would have a vehicle that could not be beat. Don't take that to mean that vehicle is underpowered.  It is not.
5,Nice little SUV,steverk ,11/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We purchased our new 2008 Honda SUV after the old Grand Marquis bit the dust.  It's a great vehicle!  Although rougher than a sedan, the ride is decent and the gas mileage has been good (23 mpg in town).  The navigation leaves a lot to be desired.  It comes up with the worst routings! The voice recognition is more pain than gain. However, the built in back up camera is helpful.  Interior is comfortable a good quality.  This is the fully loaded model, so I expected a few more bells and whistles (lighted vanity mirrors, automatic headlights, automatic day/night mirrors) but most of what is has works well and is well thought out.","Easy handling, good gas mileage, spacious feel, fun to drive.",Improve the software in the navigation system.
4.875,love it!,CATHERINE ,11/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,This is my first new car i have purchased. I have owned 2 vw's and 2 bmw's. Love them all but this time i just couldn't afford another bmw. Everybody I spoke with told me that they love their Hondas and that's all they will ever buy again. I know what they mean now. I have only owned it for a month now but the ride is so smooth. When your at a stop sign you think the car  turned off because it is so quiet. I just started to use the wipers and that took me a few tries to figure them out. Backing up is a little difficult though. I have to lift my head a bit higher and move more towards the center of the car to see the back window. Once I get use to it it shouldn't be a problem hopefully! ,"Interior, seat warmers :) controls on steering wheel",
5,Surprised,Jennifer Lakin ,10/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was pleasantly surprised with the CR-V.  I have been dying for the Nissan Murano, but at $11,000 more for almost identical features, I had to reconsider.  I also considered the Honda Civic and Accord, and the Civic actually had a more high tech interior.  Overall, though for the money, I got most everything I wanted, without a lot of hassle in different packages.  They had the one I wanted at the dealer and I drove it home.  I couldn't say the same for the Murano - as they wanted to add AFTER market stuff.  The CR-V is easy to drive, fun to handle, I just drove it home and I'm in love with the navigation, which I originally decided I could live without - but I was wrong - I love it!   ","Bluetooth #1, Navigation, moonroof, heated seats, heated outer mirrors, dual climate control - rubber floor mat in the back - easy to clean.  Configuration of the back seats is awesome.  Love the power driver's seat and love the reclining rear seats.  My dad drove it and is going tomorrow to get his",I HATE that there is no push button start and no keyless remote entry! No digital gauges.  The cup holders are too small and the middle center door cover is cheap looking - like a roll up door.  Wish it locked too and wish it had remote hatchback opening. Needs better rear view mirror and homelink
4.625,Exceeded my expectations,Chas ,10/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"Traded Infiniti G35 for more cargo space.  Now at 4,500 miles, I really like this car.  Wife previously had an earlier model CR-V.  This is far better.  Gas mileage, interior, and performance.  Don't be fooled by competitor's 6 cyl models, this 4 cyl has plenty of power.  Handled road trips on hilly interstate highway without annoying tranny downshifts.  Gas mileage is 30 mpg on freeway if you stay around 70 mph.  In town it's around 22-23 mpg.  Back up camera is GREAT!  Really miss it when I drive my wife's car or a rental.  Audio system excellent.  Appreciate the PC-Card slot and integration with audio system to play MP-3.  Nav system improved over my wife's 2004 Pilot, better than G35.","Back-up camera, Nav system, efficient and economical power train, PC-Card audio integration for MP-3, smooth tranny","Bluetooth cell phone connection, better quality carpet (fuzz accumulates on floor dragging feet on vehicle floor), hybrid version"
5,For my BABIES,JASTORG1 ,10/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded my mighty fast '08 Altima for CR-V because we are anticipating a second baby. I was really surprised when I drove the CR-V, I was thinking a sluggish small SUV. But I was wrong. Sure, there is no head spinning pull (torque) but the power for me is adequate. Interior is first class. Not plastic-y! :-). There was a slight changes of feel coming from a CVT. Size of interior is huge, don't be fooled on outside looks. Overall we (wife) love the vehicle.

5,Love it!,Honda Girl ,10/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded an '08 Kia Sorento for my CR- V and couldn't be happier.  The build quality is in a class of it' own and this vehicle has a very well thought design.  I've owned a Honda in the past and my main complaint with my '04 Accord was road noise, and they've made great improvements with that.  On my first tank the CR-V averaged 24.9 mpg (combined city/hwy).  There's plenty of room for people and cargo and I like how the back sits flip forward.  The back lift gate is easy to close, which was a problem with the Sorento, which had a very heavy/cumbersome litigate. Love how wide the doors open! Can't really comment on reliability yet but I expect no major problems since it is a Honda. ","Console display, comfort, drives like a car (great handling!), good gas mileage, plenty of acceleration power for a 4 cyl. and loads of storage room. Materials are sturdy and it just feels solid. Love the moonroof. Doesn't have side roll that many SUVs have; it's steady on turns!","Maybe offer a hybrid version.  I'm a little surprised at how much I like the center console tray, but others may not. "

Better mpg would be nice, but I realize it's a tradeoff to get performance and to be up off the ground. ","Roominess, comfort, ability to haul things, nice interior layout.  Controls are easy and intuitive.  "," Please add variable-speed intermittent wipers to the LX trim.  I've owned base-level cars in the past that had that feature.

5,Excellant Choice,jmichael ,10/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We compared the CRV LX AWD to the Toyota Rav4 Base 4 cylinder 4x4. We got a much better deal on the Cr-v, and it was the better choice. The interior of the CR-V is designed much better than the Rav4, and the ride of the CR-V is quieter, and much smoother. On the Highway we have been averaging 32.5 MPG. We haven't used the AWD yet but looking forward to the CR-V pulling us through the snow. The dash board controls are user friendly. The CR-V lets you know how many miles you have left before filling up which the Rav4 Base did not have. For a four cylinder engine you can not go wrong with this vehicle. If you can do without the sunroof, and other options the LX model has the same engine and body.","I can not just name one thing great about our CR-V, great mileage, the look, it's very roomy, great pick up for a 4 cylinder.

I am getting 31 hwy and around 22 city. well above what this vehicle is rated.I love the ride and I don't think i could ever go back to a sedan. ,Lots of room for a small suv great ride quality,i would like to see Honda make a hybrid CR-V They would have a runaway best seller!
4.25,Critics Thoughts,crocksan ,08/27/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"This is an all around great car. There are a few things missing that really surprised me coming from Honda. First the fuel economy around town is between 15 and 16 MPG rated 22 mpg. The car is driven mainly by my wife albeit on short trips but nothing exceptionally dramatic. The highway mileage is right on the rating, 25 mpg to 30 mpg. The lack of a center console and just a shelf is annoying. The arm rest on the front seats, useless, way to small. The telescoping and adjustable steering wheel no help for a long legged person trying to enter when the wife leaves the seat forward. The sun visors are to short turned to the side windows. I would recommend the car all in all a great car.","The aux jack and the rear shelf, the rest is a typical of all others in category. ","Extend the length of the car make the entry into the vehicle more accessible. Add the center console, and put the extenders on the sun visors this is a safety issue, Toyota RAV does."
5,Winner,Bobby ,08/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Third CR-V. All have been excellent especially fuel consumption. Excellent acceleration from on-ramps to merge into faster traffic. No difficulty with rear view, as this was a suggested shortcoming with current design.",steering wheel mounted controls for radio and cruise control ,water and slush drip on my back when tail gate is open in inclement weather. Honda can solve this by extending a rubber flap at the base of the door. Would appreciate a power driver's seat.
5,2008 CRV - excellent choice!,newCRV-EXL ,08/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"2008 2WD EX-L  This is a very nice vehicle - my first SUV. We were looking at the RAV4 and the Nissan Rogue as well, but went with this. Got it for $2200 below sticker price.  No regrets so far. I have driven it for a week now (330 miles) - 1st tank of gas averaged 26.2 mpg. About 2/3 of it was in the city and 1/3 on the highway. Pretty good considering the car isn't even broken in yet.  The acceleration is a little lacking on an uphill ramp & a bit noisy but does not bother me too much.  The 270 watt stereo is awesome! Moonroof and leather are great, the seats are quite comfortable contrary to what some others have mentioned, but I agree the lumbar support is not very hard.","Mileage, comfortable ride, great interior, leather, moonroof, 270 W stereo, and my favorite, the cargo shelf!",Acceleration is a little lacking but it's pretty good for a 2.4 L 4-cyl engine.
4.875,Best small SUV,Dan ,08/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is the best all around small SUV on the market.  Toyota gets close but has that ridiculous door on the back. All the others just don't match up in refinement and/or gas mileage.  We drive 50 miles to work (one way) a day plus around town a bit, and even with all the Missouri hills we average 26 mpg (have seen it average 30 mpg on pure highway travel).  The Toyota can probably match that but I know that the Nissan Rogue with its CVT would have issues when it comes to hills.   We've owned two Nissan's with CVTs-while very good on gas on flat surfaces, they are extremely bad in hilly areas.  Otherwise, the CR-V is a great, quiet, and comfortable ride with lots of space.  ",The ride is very good - not much tire or wind noise; the craftsmanship; the cubbies; the vast open space in front and back; the stereo is not bad either.  Very good A/C ( better than competitors) but could use rear vents on super hot days.,Honda needs to get with the program and offer blue-tooth without navigation!  Seats are a bit harder than its competitors.  The Nissan definitely had a leg up on driver comfort...but that comes with the price of a smaller interior/cargo space.  The Honda is still comfortable enough.

The ride is smooth and the build quality is excellent. I am getting 28 mpg on the highway and 25mpg overall, I am sure this will improve once the car is driven more. Honda is so focused on small details of the car, both interior and exterior features, and the ride is very quiet and comfortable. The styling of my suv, and it is the base model, is extremely sharp looking and rivals the appearance of much more expensive vehicles. The dealer experience has been great so far, I hope to have this Honda for many years.

Inside trunk latch would be nice also.  I do have to replace the tires already after only 20,000.  Hope it's because the tires were a poor grade and not an indication that the car is hard on tires.

I needed something that was big enough to haul things like 50 lb bags of animal feed and a bale of hay once in awhile, and it can. We also needed a vehicle that got good gas mileage.  This vehicle has met all our needs for hauling and I gets between 25-31 mpg. per tank.   If I set the cruise control and then decel a bit, I get the best mileage. The only thing that I miss about the van is the cushy ride. The CR-V has a stiff ride, no luxury . Air conditioner works well on 100 degree days.

4.875,Exceeds Expectations,Bill317 ,08/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"We bought this vehicle because we wanted something with better gas mileage than our Mercury Mountaineer but that still had the flexibility of an SUV, upright seating, AWD for the snow and was comfortable for my daily commute.  After a lot of research and  test drives we settled on the CR-V and have been very happy with our choice.  We just took the CRV on a 2200 mile round trip to visit some family members and it performed better than we had hoped. We averaged 29 MPG on the trip. The CRV was comfortable and fun to drive.  It is fine for a couple with one or two children or as a commuter car for someone who likes the more elevated seating of an SUV.","Dual zone climate control, lumbar support driver seat, handling, rear storage shelf","Bluetooth, IPOD integration so you can control the IPOD rather than just play it through an auxiliary input, a better radio, relocate the subwoofer so you don't lose the storage under the passenger seat, a fully heated passenger seat including the back, a more robust A/C system and better rear vents"

We purchased the Accord EXL.  Immediately we knew that we made a huge error. After 3600 miles, we traded for a New CR-V EXL. We are hooked. I actually attained 36 MPG on a freeway trip driving at 59 MPH with the cruise control set. Unfortunately, the trade was expensive because I was at the dealer's mercy. Am I sorry? Heck no.  It only hurt for a little while and WE LOVE our two CR-V's.","Economy meter.  With gas prices so high, I can monitor my driving. We also love the Radio (XM).

I put a lot of mileage on a car and my civic was the first car I had ever owned that had lasted so long (8 years) with no major malfunctions, so I was already a Honda fan.  I've had my CR-V a week now, but I do really enjoy it. It's fun and easy to drive, and comfortable, with great gas mileage for its class.  I've had no problems at all with it so far, and love many of the features of the EX-L style.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to others - it's a fun, convenient car, with plenty of space, good driving, and Honda's impressive reliability.  ",I love the Navigation and voice command features.  I also really appreciate the option that calculate your average mpg and the miles you can drive based on the amount of gas you have left - those are invaluable features and kudos to Honda for putting them in!,"I wish there was just a little more room in the front driver seat.  However, I'm over 6 foot, so most people will not have trouble.  Also, the armrests could be just a tad longer."

I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase. I compared it to a Rav4, Subaru, and others like Volvo's and Audi's. I wanted a practical car, but also wanted something luxurious! I went for the EX- L w/ Nav, and love all the bells and whistles. Feels solid, luxurious, love being up high, 4wd, and all the extras. Zips around the city and easy to park, and comfortable with great gas mileage on longer drives.  Love the storage and space of this vehicle, doesn't feel like a compact suv.

4.875,Downsizing to Save Cash,Bob L ,07/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Got real tired of visiting gas stations with my Jeep Grand Cherokee and decided to try the 2008 Honda CR-V. Great handling and very fun to drive. I don't miss my Jeep one bit. Its a tiny SUV with lots of heart. Gas mileage has been as high as 28 mpg, but average has been 25 mpg, not great but acceptable. If you want better fuel economy buy a Hybrid something or a Civic. Interior is good quality, spacious, and comfortable. The rear storage compartment behind the rear passengers is divided in two sections by a removable upper shelf. This design leaves a lot to be desired and can be very annoying when trying to load a large object. Overall we have enjoyed this mini SUV and highly recommend it. ","Fun to drive, great turning radius, has all the conveniences anyone would want. The designers thought of everything and made the SUV very user friendly. Interior is upscale with comfortable seating. Gas mileage for an SUV is good considering its has AWD. Smart exterior styling and a pleasure to own!","Weak engine performance while passing. The nose design is strange and required an air deflector to improve look. The rear cargo section split upper and lower is awkward and annoying. The standard car mats are cheap and won't last long.

So far, the CR-V has lived up to its billing.  Firstly, the acceleration is much better than expected.  I've had a few brief moments of lagging response, but for a 4 cyl 166 hp engine, it's extremely peppy and responsive. Interior display & materials on the ex are beautiful (the reason why I chose the CR-V over the rav4).   Unfortunately, after only 1,500 miles of driving, my alternator, battery, and fuse panel needed to be replaced.  Not good, but I'm hopeful this is an isolated incident, and not indicative of future reliability.  My mpg is respectable, averaging 23 with 50/50 city/highway. ","MPG feedback tied to tachometer, interior build quality, dual climate control, tire hidden underneath floor panel, solid acceleration, accurate navigation","Seat is decent, but could be more supportive (I have a bad back); it was hard to find a comfortable position!

In this time of astronomical gas prices, we took a gamble in purchasing an SUV-type vehicle. We were hoping for better gas mileage like many other reviewers, but barely 20 mpg is all we get so far with this 4-cylinder rather under-powered cross-over. Handles well, but ride is rough.

Leather seats are comfortable. Very spacious and great visibility all around.  There is just a bit of wind noise at 65 mph, which i was looking for after reading the reviews, but its really not that much. Inside ergonomics are great.  Handles great, not stiff.  A bit under powered if you're a more aggressive driver, but its plenty quick for highway passing. Very convenient with storage space and inside compartments.  Outside looks great.  That's just a personal opinion.","Tinted glass, inside ergonomics, dash layout, 12 v power in the rear, rear seats that recline, rear doors open about 90 degrees, front and rear window airbags.",Door handles need to be of better quality or covered with leather.

I am so happy - I think I made the right choice. Just got back from a 2000 mile round trip from Oklahoma to Michigan, and the CR-V handled like a dream. Gas mileage was around 27 mpg overall. It was plenty roomy for my two dogs (in the back seat) and I and all our cargo for a week fit nicely in the storage area behind the back seat. LOVE the cargo shelf - it was perfect for lightweight items. I felt very secure in the CR-V; it felt very stable. Plenty of get up and go for passing all the semis!! I imagine that I will have this vehicle for a very long time.","Cargo shelf, dual air controls, very comfortable seats, folding side mirrors, acceleration, smoothness, IPod port, Satellite radio, ample cargo space.

The dealer told us that this is quite normal, however, we have owned a Subaru Forester and other vehicles with AC in the past and have never had this problem.  We do not believe that this is normal as the temperature here has not been over 20 and the climate contr0ol is always set at 22 or higher.","Performance, comfort and roominess.","Climate control Condensation leaving water puddle on floor - we have a metal pan on the floor to catch warer, a real pain!!

5,Great For the Money,jbjudkins ,06/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this car for my wife earlier this year.  So far, we love it.  It was the first Japanese car in the family and I don't know if I will ever go back to American.  It is by far the best valued small SUV and most economical to drive.  There is a ton of room and it rides very nice.  Another added bonus...it is cheaper to insure than my 2006 Pontiac Vibe.  I didn't expect that.",I love the Ipod jack.  Gas mileage is great.

It could be the novelty, but this car is the best car I have ever driven, and same for my wife.  I test drove a lot of cars, and this one was the only car with the proverbial all-around package.  Fun to drive, classy, gas mileage, decent price, great features, etc.  I have only owned this a very short while, but I couldn't be happier.  On top of it all, it's a Honda.","smooth transmission, quiet ride, superb handling, xm radio, alloy wheels, leather, and just an overall ""solid"" feel when I am driving.","The rear seats seem a little on the cheap side and I think all-weather floor mats should be standard for any SUV (small or not), but I am really reaching.

I looked at the Toyota Rav4, but decided on the CR-V. I was a little worried about getting a 4cyl, but I have no trouble passing. It handles really well and has a quiet, smooth ride. It has nice smooth brakes.  Good gas mileage, I get 22-24 mpg.  I hope I have my CR-V for 22 years!","Love having heated seats.  And it has the perfect spot for my purse on the floor in front.

When the third generation was announced I was counting down the days until I could buy mine. It has yet to disappoint me. The little quirks were worked out from my first gen and I am so happy I sprung for the EX instead of the base model. I love the feel of driving it and everything. Mileage while not bad could be better I average 19-21 but I mostly do city driving. On the freeway I can usually get 25+. ,"Radio controls on the wheel, daytime headlights, one touch moonroof, ample legroom for my family (I am shortest at 5'9""), the handles to pull down the tailgate, almost everything!

4.75,The best car I ever owned,CingleMom ,06/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,I only had my CR-V for a week and I love it.  I traded my 2007 Dodge Caliber for it.  This is one of the best decisions I've made in a long time.  The Caliber was horrible.  The Honda CR-V drives like a dream.  I wouldn't trade it for the world.

4.25,Nice but...,hesaid ,06/13/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,My wife loves her new CR-V. We did some comparison shopping and the CR-V is best choice out there for this size SUV. ,"Ride height - allows you to see the road well. Fit and Finish is excellent. Body style looks more modern (less boxy) than previous generation. I like the 17"" alloys on the EX. Most of the interior looks very good (see suggested improvement for exception). CR-V is much more appealing than the RAV4.",1) Fix sharp corners on rear door. This is a BAD design if you have children. It's a safety hazard. 2) Make the tailgate adjustable for how high it opens. It hits my garage door. 3) The console design was better in last generation. Last generation had better storage options. 4) Make arm rests wider.
5,Great for kids,apple ,06/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We have parked the large SUV and are driving this small one.  Our mileage has gone from 13 on the old SUV to 26 on the new one.  This car is great for carpooling to school and the room in the back seat for the three kids is excellent.  I haven't heard a single complaint about space.  I have learned to drive differently to save on gas and I am careful with the acceleration because I am used to a V8.  We gave up leather and saved $2000 which we rolled over into tuition!  I don't regret that now and hopefully won't in a few years.  Thoughtful design, kid friendly, easy to drive and our first Honda.  All in all a good deal.",Ipod capability is fun and so is the volume controls on the steering wheel.  Gas mileage is better than I thought. We love the cover in the hatch to keep valuables hidden.

5,Downsizing,wjs ,06/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We purchased our CR-V almost 2 weeks ago, and LOVE IT! We had a 1999 Expedition with almost 200,000 miles and it fit our needs really well, but with our oldest daughter getting her license and hardly ever being with us anymore we decided to downsize. We almost purchased the Accord we knew it fit our needs and was a solid car, but wasn't too thrilled about getting a car.  Our salesperson asked if we looked at the CR-V and we thought it was too small but decided to look anyway. We were very surprised on how much space was inside our 3 long legged daughters fit nicely in the back (they are 5'8"", 5'6"" and 5'4""). We don't know how a long car trip will be, but know day trips will be just fine!","Gas mileage, we are averaging between 27 and 29, about double what I was getting in my Expedition.

It was so small and low to the ground, but I have had no problems adjusting to the CR-V!  I love Hondas and I fell in love with the CR-V the moment I saw it.  When my husband and I test drove it, that was it!  It is so much fun to drive and it handles great!  I wish the gas mileage was a little better, but hopefully it will improve, as I only have 175 miles on it!  It is nice to use regular gas.  My Prelude required premium!  It's also nice having so much room!  I can actually take people in my backseat!","Gorgeous exterior, interior is so practical, love the blue and white gauges, automatic door locks, radio controls on steering wheel.

I took a Memorial Day trip from the New York Metro Area to Ocean City, MD.  I was astonished that my car averaged over 30 mpg and I only used a little more than half a tank on the 260 mile drive down to Maryland.  The entire trip used a tank and a half.  I'm not your typical CR-V owner, if there is one.  I am a 24 yr old male.  I owned a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee before this car and couldn't keep up with the 14 mpg.

The ride is smooth, and the acceleration and passing speed is more than adequate for passing and overall safety.

The Scion replaced a 95 Accord wagon which was wrecked and has been sorely missed ever since.  The CR-V has everything the Scion didn't.  Very nice ride, good seating comfort, low road and engine noise level at highway speeds, good cargo space even with the rear seats upright. I expected the CR-V's gas mileage to be a lot less than the Scion's 32 - 33 mpg on the highway at 65 mph, but the CR-V is delivering within 1 - 2 mpg of the Scion's best mileage. This is my 6th Honda built car in 24 years.  Acura Legends and Accords.  All were superb.  I have only about 300 miles on it, but I expect this CR-V be the best of them all.

It obviously lacks the acceleration of my old A4, but I love the trade-off of the well-engineered and trusty V-TEC engine.  I get 30mpg hiway and 25+ mixed (nearly double my last truck).  I have NO problem passing at highway speeds.  Only thing I would do differently is get the EX-L, which has more upgrades than just leather  like air vents for rear passengers, nicer console, better stereo...","Legendary V-TEC reliability, fuel economy, price, lots of utility but nicer looking than Element.

The drive is smoother, the interior is nice, and the fuel economy is up there. I read others who were complaining about things missing that I have on my EX-L.

We replaced the ugly wheels for lighter alloys at tire store for $600). Gas mileage (spring) is currently around 33 mpg highway (63 - 65 mph) and a bit better on secondary roads with few stops (34 mpg) - in Michigan driving environment and conservative acceleration.

5,Out of Subaru into Honda,Jim ,04/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have driven Subarus for twenty years. I've owned six of them. I was about to trade in my '98 Legacy Outback Limited for an '08. But then I hesitated and decided to enjoy the shopping process since I was going to be buying a new car.  I looked at the Nissan briefly and then on to the Honda store. There I took a brief drive in the demo. That did it. That night I decided to give up my Subaru loyalty (they're great cars) and buy a Honda.  I got the EX-L because I wanted the heated seats and leather upholstery. I had the store add the rain deflectors.  This past weekend I took a 500-mile round trip to Maine and back. I got 29.4 mpg.  I had a good experience in the trading process.,I just love the 6-CD player and the xm radio. Did I mention the heated seats? I'm still learning the bells and whistles. This has a little engine that can really go.,I think the company ought to provide the retractable cargo cover as standard equipment.

A V-6 would be nice, but everything else is superb.  I like the styling, the fit and finish are perfect, the interior space is surprisingly adequate, and the fuel economy is what I hoped for.

So I looked extensively at the CR-V as well as a few other small SUV models. The CR-V seemed to be the best buy for the money, 5-star safety, decent fuel economy, great ride, and decent performance and interior space.  I read many favorable reviews on edmunds, and thought there's no way this many people could be wrong! I read one review suggesting a moonroof visor with the roof rack to reduce noise...thank you whomever made that recommendation! I did the same thing, and it's a perfectly quiet car.

She didn't like the looks of the CR-V but I convinced her to take a test drive. She loved it - then we drove the Rav. Within a block she said no to the Rav and yes to the CR-V. We found the CR-V had more room but also had a more comfortable ride. The way this vehicle drives won us over.,"Comfortable seats, lots of room and a real kick to drive.

I opted for a little upgrade with the moonroof, privacy glass, and AWD.  Immediately after purchasing it I drove 250 miles through rural Utah.  Had no problem accelerating, even going 75 on a steep incline, or passing.  Also had no problem with the road noise that others mentioned, although  I'm used to way more road noise.  The mpg has been around 20 in the city and 25 on the highway, I expect it to increase as i break it in a bit more.  Even with the underbite of a front bumper, I couldn't be happier with this car.

Engine generally quiet unless you need to push it,  and down shift a couple of gears. Wish the transmission had paddle shifters like my wife's FIT. FIT is more fun to drive. Too frequently it shifts to 5th gear for mileage,  when 4th would be a better selection.  You cannot manually select 4th.  Can hit the button on the shifter and go to 3rd, but that's it.  For this engine/trans combo 4th would be really useful.

It drives like a car, has all the features I wanted, better fuel economy (but not great) and the new redesign was a huge improvement. I never would have considered this car if not for the redesign.

Gas mileage is decent, but I thought it would be better. I am averaging 22.5 MPG with mixed city and highway miles. A lack of power if not an issue at all. 166HP is more than enough for highway passing. I am very impressed with the interior space and the quality of materials used.

I have not owned anything other than cars, this was very comfortable and roomy.  The gas mileage so far in mostly highway driving is about 23 mpg, but I only have about 300 miles on it right now.  ","Dashboard design, cargo space, Honda's reliability","Make all weather mats standard as well as heated side mirrors.

4.375,Decent,jm ,03/03/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,5,We have about 600 miles on our EXL. Generally very satisfied except tire noise on certain road surfaces is noticeable at 70-80 mph fwy speeds. There's also some wind noise around the doors. Not sure if different than competitors. The high stereo with subwoofer (which is nice) is not an excuse for marginal soundproofing.,Comfortable leather seats. Overall driver feel.,Soundproofing under the carpets and in spare tire well.  A better roof rack option. Two fixed crossbars are not as usefull as lengthwise mounted rails.
4.75,Great Car,fun14 ,02/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,I chose this car after looking at many in the category over the past year.  Specifically the Toyota Highlander and Acura RDX were the other contenders.  This car has most features I was looking for at a better price and with better fuel economy.  It looks nice and drives well.,"Power drivers seat, heated seats and mirrors, exterior style, backseat adjustability, MP3 input jack, navigation, AWD.","Gearshift on the steering column, steering wheel telescoping out about 3 inches further, armrests 2-3 inches longer, more padding on the seating, bluetooth, MP3 input jack/cd/storage area on the dash instead of the center console."
4.75,2008 CRV-EXL w/Nav FWD I think,Jennifer ,02/21/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just purchased the CRV last week after 3 months of research.  It was a tough decision going from a large Pathfinder to a small SUV but we could not afford the gas anymore.  Very happy with the whole dealership process, internet buying was easy and in 5 days they had my CRV.  Love the quiet ride, the Nav w/touch screen is great, the voice activated controls are good, as long as you say things slowly.  Still reading the book on all the extra features.  Rear seats have more room than expected, and love having so much visibility of the other lanes around me when I drive.  The Pathfinder was boxy and limited.  Can't comment on the fuel economy yet, and still trying to find the FWD button!","The Back-up camera is great, space is pretty accurate when shown on screen.  The Nav has been easy to use so far, and the ride is quite and comfortable.  So far no real pick up issues on the highway. The CD changer in the center console and the shift being on the front panel takes getting used to.","Honda needs to up their standard options on a top of the line model like Acura does.  Roof Racks, Back up Sensors, Fog Lights, Bluetooth and Auto Day/Night mirror should be standard adding them could cost an extra 2k so we decided to do a little at a time.  Updated Nav CDs are too expensive."
4.5,Love the car but not the city mileage,City Driver ,02/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,1,5,"I just purchased this great car about a week ago. I do love it in all ways excpet one: fuel efficiency in the city is awful. I am saddened and shocked as I really expected a little better. I live in a hilly city with lots of stop and go. Mileage thus far has been a constant 14.4. Weather has been perfectly clear and have not had to utilize the 4wd yet. This mileage is worse that my 6cyl RX300Lexus (year 2000). In fact, I traded in a 1999 Mercedes E320 so I could get some fuel efficiency and the CR-V is worse than that car, too.  Well, it is a great car to drive in the city and I am enjoying it. ",,
4.875,Excellent Small SUV with good mpg,KP ,02/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased my CR-V in a snowstorm, picked it up in another snowstorm and have driven it through 4 snowstorms since. I am 150% pleased with purchase. I looked at the RAV-4, as well, but didnt like the handling and tire on the back of the Rav4.  MPG is about 22.5 right now with mixed bumper to bumper city driving and highway driving in Chicago. Given that the AWD has been used frequently and the engine still isnt broken in, I expect this figure to go up. All total I have about 4-500 mi on it.  Performance has been great for a 4cy, though it would be nice for more hp or a 6cy option. I had a 05 Accord 6cy prior to this, and I do miss the power, but I still love my CR-V.","Car-like handling, the AWD is excellent in snow, back is spacious with the seats folded up, the blue lighting on the console. The refined Honda quality and attention to detail honestly can't be beat. I will never go back to Ford or GM.","Lighted vanity mirrors, fog lights and winter floor mats should be standard in northern climates. Would like the option to totally remove the rear seats rather than just folding up."
5,Great car,Lisa ,02/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this car after much research. I test drove the Chevy Equinox and there was no comparison. I wanted a 4 cyl so I didn't even look at the RAV 4's. We have a 2006 Pilot and 1997 Accord so I knew how reliable the Honda's are. I love this car. Fun to drive, plenty of room. I opted for the ex and glad I did. The seats are beautiful and comfortable. I like the fact that the console fold down. So far no problems. It has plenty of power for a 4 cyl and I live in the valley with many hills.","Style, inside console, a lot of room, moon roof that is standard","Lighted mirror on sun visor, standard fob lights and backup sensors"

Great ride and this is my 4th Honda and the best, never did use the picnic table. Glad I upgraded to the EXL.  It handles better than previous models but I wish the rear gate had a split door, cannot get an extension ladder in there, great for the dogs, stuff and not as top heavy.  Great layout of the digital dashboard and the fuel economy light, and love the lumbar support and the seat heaters (like my dad's 1950 Studebaker).  Honestly how can you beat a Honda for practicality, sensible layout and usefulness?","Navigation and the leather seats, how could I not have had them in the past?",Needs bluetooth or similar as standard.  The cupholders are to small and the back gate needs to be split but these are hardly deal breakers. It could use a power port and an A/C port in the back seat. Loose some weight to increase MPG or bring out a hybrid model.
5,Nice compact  SUV, Great CRV ,02/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Traded in an Accord which was a great car, just sat too low, had difficult time getting in and out. The CRV is just the right height to enter and exit. Looked at the Rav 4 but decided to stick with the Honda. Handles great, leather seats are comfortable with good support.

4.5,2008 Honda CR-V EX-L 4dr SUV AWD ,nmcdonald ,02/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,3,4,5,"I decided to buy this car based on Edmunds editor and consumer reviews, track record, price, and purported high gas mileage. I was selecting between the Mazda CX-9 and the Nissan Murano, and the CR-V. Since I was replacing a Toyota Camry, I thought that the size of the CR-V would be fine. The price was lower than the other two and the gas mileage, I thought would be great in comparison to the other two vehicles.  Even though I receive about 24 to 25.5 mpg on my commutes according to the car, I can still only seem to average about 300 miles or 20 mpg per tank. I drive mostly highway miles and the mileage range advertised is not for the AWD models","I am impressed with the build, quality materials and the attention to detail during the building process for this vehicle. It is smooth, fun to drive and it will surprise most since it is only a 4 cylinder. Even closing the door gives off a sound that lets you know that it is built well.",Auto-lights shutoff and better gas mileage on the AWD model. Also give back the six inches of seat to the driver by removing the seats side detailing because it makes a difference on long drives.  
4.625,New CRV,cxv ,01/31/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,5,4,Hard to judge built quality this early since my CRV is so new but so far not a single problem.  The engine could use a little bit more power but no regrets.  The fuel economy is decent for the type of vehicle and the big tank with an 87 octance is a relief.  The interior is very comfortable and nicely put together.  Before taking delivery I've noticed a scratch in the shift level indicator.  The dealership will replace under warranty.  Hard to judge exterior design.  Is no Alfa Romeo but not bad.,"All the safety features.  I was looking into more premium cars like Saab and Volvos for safety but after learning that the CRV share all these features at a lower price decided to save some money.  The CRV feels like a premium car anyways.  Nice stereo, AC, seats, NVH.",Quality control.  The competition is getting really close to match japanese quality so test drive the car and just don't go by the emblem on the grill.  Bring a diesel model for the US.

It has all the features we wanted, except for the ones I listed below. Seriously - we got this car knowing that I would miss automatic on/off headlights, knowing that it would be a little nosier than my previous car. There is just no one else who can deliver better designed and more attractive small SUV! (I'll also miss a bigger storage area between front seats, but I guess it's available on the EX-L model).","Overall design design, gear shifting, electronic console, hidden spare tire! ",(1) Headlights that can turn on and off automatically. (2) Homelink - at least as an option! (3) Just a bit better insulation to decrease road noise.

4.75,Very good handling and stylish interior,Subhash ,01/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5," I chose CRV over its competition (including but not limited to RAV4) due to: 1. Exceptional handling - highly stable at high speeds, little/no body roll on curves and turnings. As a result, feels exceptionally great and fun to drive. 2. comfortable and stylish interior - Good dash features (digital fuel and mpg indicators), drop-down center console, elevated and adjustable rear seating with good legroom making long drives very comfortable. 3. Stylish exterior - looks great from all views. Spare tyre hidden underneath cargo. 4. Good resale value due to its high demand.  My positive opinions have'nt changed after driving 3500 miles (under wide range of conditions). I get 21-22 mpg in city.",Exceptional handling and stability (apparently due to its ACE body and well engineered suspensions). Stylish interior as well as exterior. Elevated rear passenger seats are very comfortable (especially during long drives). Dashboard - digital fuel and realtime mpg indicator.,"Front row arm rests should be 2-3 inches longer and an inch thicker to be comfortable. Torque should be a bit higher. City mpg can be 1-2 mpg higher - 2008 Accord's 190 hp engine would make CRV unbeatable. Except for the cup-holders, the center console is not useful for other storage. "
4.375,Great car for the $$,Linda ,01/19/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,3,3,5,"I bought my CR-V EX about a month ago. I choose the EX because I wanted the sunroof, which was standard on the EX model.  The car is fun to drive and I've been very pleased with my purchase. This SUV is very classy looking as well, just as sophisticated as the pricier SUVs. The interior is so roomy, you actually feel like you are in a much bigger vehicle. Nice sized cargo area & the rear seats easily fold up for extra storage. ","I love the sunroof along with the 6 CD changer (also standard). Also, audio system controls are on the steering wheel which makes it a breeze to adjust the audio while never taking you eyes off the road.","While it gets the advertised gas mileage, more fuel efficiency would be welcomed. Also, while the interior is roomy, there are few storage compartments.  More could have been done with the interior. Cargo cover should also be standard.

4.875,Great Value CR V EX-L,Good value ,01/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Searched and test drove many small SUVs, Acura RDX, Toyota RAV, Subaru Outback and Ford Edge. Honda as always provides the best overall value for the money.  Yes, it is not a powerhouse but it does have enough power for most situations. The benefit is good gas mileage and the power issue is only evident in some situations. The fact is that if you know the car you can easily manipulate the power to suit your needs in those situations with the gas pedal. Hill climbing is impressive and the grade- logic design does eliminate gear hunting so I think the Edmund reviewer was a little harsh with the comment in their review.  Car is put together well and quality material is used everywhere. ","Look and overall size, more room than you think. Leather option in the EX-L wraps the gear shift and steering wheel in high quality leather offering a great feel. Driving dynamics are great for a SUV - car feels sure footed and is easy to handle in all situations. Sound system is great.","Only a couple of issues... not too sure why these issues even exist as previous Honda's and models have addressed. No home link, Navigation on the CRV could not be more different from the Honda Accord so owning both makes going back and forth confusing. Nav buttons are a little small on the CRV."

5,"Good by Expedition, Hello Honda!",Marco in Florida ,01/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Coming from a larger SUV like the Expedition, I wasn't sure how I would like the smaller SUV. It has room, comfortable ride, not noisey,very smooth on the road and highway, does great on gas, average 24-26mpg, the Expedition used to average 12mpg, so I'm very happy with the price of gas buying the CRV. I test drove the Escape, Rav4, Edge, Outlook, and a few other crossovers, and I liked the CRV the most. Other vehicles compared to the CRV were $3000.00-4000.00 more, and the Honda CRV had more to offer for the money. My wife owns a 05 Acord, and never had any problems. The 05 Expedition was always giving me problems, I'm done with Ford, and a happy Honda custmour for life!","Gas mileage, it really does get 24- 26mpg around city here in Florida. HWY  MPG, I been able to get over  30-MPG average easy. Very roomy inside, quiet ride which is nice, and 5 star saftey rating, what's not to like!

Wife loves the entire package - her ""favorite"" car.  Overall mpg from dashboard indicator is 22.3.  But, if you divide the miles by gallons put in the tank, it's about 1 mpg less.  Still not bad for a small SUV. Dual climate control is not very dual - there is only one temperature sensor.

We thus need something that can carry a lot of cargo, is easy to drive in an urban environment with reasonable gas mileage.  We have tested drove both the RAV4 and the CR-V.  We found that the design of the CR-V is very thoughtful for small families and for woman drivers.  Thus far, we believe that we have made the right decision. Many people go with the RAV4 b/c of the V6 power but review from this web site has shown that the V6 produces too much power for such a small car to be stable at high speed.

A good portion of my driving has been in snow/ice and the car handles great-I literally had to force the vehicle to lose control.  I've seen many complaints about power, but there isn't lack of power (reminder: it's not a dragster!).  The CR-V is extremely quiet as both engine and road noise are low.  Even a 30+ mph wind didn't add much noise in the cabin.  The rear cargo area wasn't as big as I thought, but it works for my needs.

5,Loving it!!!!,CRV LVR ,12/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After previously owning a Civic, I knew I wanted to go back to the Honda brand. The CR-V was a perfect fit. I was a little apprehensive becuase I have only ever owned small vehicles and knew when purchasing this vehicle that it would be the one I would drive until the wheels fall off. I could not be happier. It is a comfortable ride giving great gas mileage, mixed driving average is 24-28 mpg. I love the interior and exterior design, everything is very user friendly. I can't imagine how I lived without navigation before! The 4 cylinders in this vehicle give appropriate power, I have no issues with passing on the hwy. I have no qualms about my purchase and would make the same decision again.","Navigation, leather interior, position of all controls, gas milage management, maintenence minder.",Power rear hatch.
5,So Long VW!,Chris  ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Unlike some of the folks on here, I actually traded up from my old 2001 Jetta and purchased the '08 CRV as my first ""new"" car purchase.  I have to say that I am ecstatic!  It has incredible handling, sleek style (I've been drooling over it for the past year), and a quality build.  My mpg hasn't been the best so far (avg of 18-19), but I've literally only driven in stop and go city traffic, so I have patience.  Also, the center ""shelf"" leaves some room for improvement.  Overall, though, I am in new car heaven and I would... hands down... recommend this car to anyone.  Honest.  ","Style, comfort, feel of steering wheel (I actually like it), sound quality, and above all... amazingly fun to drive.",Center console with storage... even as an option? But that's about it!
4.625,Nice little SUV,bb ,12/03/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,Purchased top of the line CRV EX-L. My wife loves this car! Fairly comfortable and easy to navigate around town. The dual-zone climate control is very poor. If the outside temperature is 3 - 10 degrees cooler than required setting the system constantly flips between cold or hot air. Can't quite seem to find a balance. Rear seat passengers complain about the temperature when set to automatic. Not easy to control manually either. Had to move up to the EX-L to get comfortable seats.  The leather seats are comfortable and make a big difference. Dash is tasteful and controls well placed. Price is high for the features on the car. Banking on long term reliability or resale to provide value.,Smooth and quite engine. Perfect size SUV for around town. Predicted reliability.,Temperature control redesign needed! Backup sensors as a factory option. (dealer did not have stock!) Power liftgate. Offer Homelink. Headlights that can turn off automatically. Better base audio system on top of the line model. Add Front passenger electric control. Driver memory.
5,Great runabout car,CR-V Owner ,11/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"2008 Cr-v is a great car. For the money I paid for it, I got much more than I have expected. People say the engine in the Cr-v is not powerful enough - thats simply not true. I find this car to have more than enough power for whatever my needs might be. Besides, it is fast, quiet, has virtually no blind spots, and handles really nice. Plus, it is hard to find an SUV in this price range that looks so good both inside and outside.","Good mileage - I get 23 mpg on average (I drive both in the city and on highways). Rear seats fold down in a way that maximizes the cargo space. Being a tall man with fairly long legs, I find Cr-v to be spacious. Design is great - very clean and contemporary. Driving cr-v is a lot of fun","The EX model does not have the console between the front seats. It has a tray that folds down, but you really need a compartment to keep your stuff out of the view. Black door handles and mirrors on the EX model. I live in Illinois - I could use heated mirrors in the winter (again, EX)"
5,Great Small SUV,bigsr120 ,11/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I previously drove a 2004 Honda EX CR-V on a lease, which I turned in about four months ago. I purchased the 2008 EX CR-V about four weeks ago and absolutely love it. It is so much better than my previous SUV in comfort, ergonomics, technology, and overall style. I am averaging approximately 24 MPG, in mixed city/highway driving. My 04 CR-V was a pleasure to drive, but this total redesign really blows it away. The safety features are terrific with full side curtain and seat side airbags. With included traction control and vehicle stability assist, I feel so much safer driving this completely redesigned version. The CR-V handles nimbly, rides smoothly, and is much quieter than my 2004 CR-V.","My favorite features include the six disc CD changer, which plays MP3 and WMA encoded discs. I have four WMA discs in the changer which includes about 80 full CD's, and they sound great. Other favorites include auto door locking, auto wiper speed adjust, average and instant MPG, and miles to empty.","The EX trim level should really include heated outside mirrors and fog lights. It would also be nice to include auto dimming rear view mirror with included compass. This is available as an add on, but at a very high price."
4,Not That Great,CRVBUYER ,11/23/2007,,,4,5,5,4,,3,4,3,4,"I debated between the CRV and Rav4. I decided in the end that the CRV cost less to buy fully loaded. I bought the AWD leather version and added fog lights, running boards and side molding. I like the interior of the CRV but should have test driven it on the highway a little more before buying.  The wind noise above 50 mph is pretty annoying and it's not the smoothest ride in the world! Also, after 700 miles, still averaging only 23 MPG with 80% of that highway miles. Not acceptable. I feel like I could have bought a more powerful V6 and gotten the same type of mileage. ","I like the dashboard lights. It has some blue, white and green lights. Not for everyone I guess. Test drive at night. XM radio. Build quality although the cargo cover rattles. Haven't figured where yet. Supposed to have high resale value.","Auto on headlights. I keep thinking my lights are on when CRV facing a wall but it is the daytime running lights! Better gas mileage! I gave up a 34 MPG Corolla for the CRV. I will feel the pain when gas hits $4.00 a gallon! Finally, improve on the wind noise. It's driving me nutty. "
4.875,SWLA 08 CR-V,kipnita ,11/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Adequate space, super economy, not as comfortable as my prior vehicle (Chevy Avalanche) and somewhat load on certain pavement surfaces but overall a very pleasing, efficient CUV.  I cross shopped with the RAV4 (too spartan in base trim - sunroof not available and MUCH more expensive in sport and limited trims when comparably equipped), and Ford Escape (throwback to yesteryear).  Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.","Sunroof, tilt/telescopic steering, instrument display, stereo (6 disc cd changer that plays mp3 discs is nice), fuel economy is great - I am averaging 30 on the highway and 25-26 in town!  ",Increased noise reduction with respect to coarse pavement.  Ride is somewhat choppy and could use improvement.  Availability of XM and color matched door handles on EX model would be an improvement.
5,What's not to like?,Freetrog ,11/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I don't think I'm your typical buyer - I drive a special edition Porsche 911 and I wanted some utility to carry stuff - dog, golf clubs, and occasionally people. My options going in were Lexus GX470, Porsche Cayenne Turbo, or the CR-V. I know - a crazy mix.  I looked at BMW, Mazda, Subaru, etc. I bought the CR-V as I felt it had the quality of the BMW, solid structure (good handling), spaciousness, and fuel economy (light carbon footprint). I couldn't be happier - it has everything an more that I need and want in a vehicle of this type. Engine is sufficient for my tasks, handling is nimble, brakes great. Visibility is good, comfortable and economical - can it get any better. Very pleased.","Build quality, design (yes, every year cars do get better), brakes, handling and economy.",None - it's pretty good as it is. If I had a 4wd model I'd want a small V6 engine.
5,Pure T Good,Luther & JoAnne ,11/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I traded my 2007 Xterra in on the 2008 Honda CRV EX because my wife was having trouble getting in and out of the Xterra because it was too high off of the ground for her even though it had running boards. We love everything about the CRV especially the good gas mileage. The CRV is just what the doctor ordered for us. ,"Looks, lots of compliments. I weigh 240, my son weighs 300 pounds and my little petite wife all fit in the CRV with room to spare. Good storage. Good music system. 34 miles to the gallon on the trip back from Orangeburg. ",Can't think of any.
5,Jeep Guy to a Honda Guy,John V ,11/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have owned a Jeep Wrangler for ten years and just purchased a 2008 Honda CR-V.  This car drives like a Cadillac, nice and smooth and has lots of power. I am so impressed with the power. It has so much passing power.  My CR-V is black with black leather seats.  The interior is so classy and roomy.  The sun-roof really opens things up and I love the shelf tray in the back. Lot's of room when you fold the back seats up.","Heated leather seats are great.  Six disc changer, MP3 player, satellite Radio. Dual climate controls. I-VTEC engine will blow your socks off.  Lots of safety with all of the airbags. Comfortable seat belts.",I have owned this car for two weeks and it is such a pleasure to drive.  I drive forty-five minutes to work and back and it is now fun to drive even to work. One of the smartest choices you could make.
5,Luv the CRV,Honda Fan ,10/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have recently purchased the CRV EX.  I have an Accord and an Odyssey.  I was very surprised at the interior room.  It looks smaller from the outside than the inside.  I've driven it on dry and wet roads and it handles great on both.  I had read some reviews about the 4 cylinder not having enough power but found it to have more than ample power to leave most people sitting at stop lights. The interior design is good, especially the center table that folds down.  It is annoying to get in a car and have nowhere to put my purse and stuff. I would have liked to have gotten the EX-L instead of the EX for the leather but would have lost this feature for a console.  Basically, I love this car.   ","My favorite features are the sporty look, the handling, various inside accessories, but especially the fold down console.",Leather with a fold down console and bit more comfortable rear seat.
5,Great little SUV!!,Lynn's SUV ,10/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Excellent SUV from Honda, like the ergonomics and the dashboard layout! CRV handles real well on very winding roads were we live. The suspension handles potholes good too. I am getting 28 mpg overall so far, have less than 900 miles on Honda CRV. Test drove other SUVs comparable to the CRV ,they did not compare!  ","There are no blind spots when driving, like the way the drive train handles , engine is very good, quiet. Sound system is good for this type of SUV . ","Make door handles on EX same color as the rest of the exterior . Other than that love the crossover SUV, keep up the good work Honda !"
4.875,Love it!,Dan W ,10/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Maybe it's just the new car allure, but so far I love my new CR-V. I've owned Honda cars since 1983 and have enjoyed every one. I would still be driving my 2006 Honda Civic if it weren't totaled in a fwy accident. I walked away because the car saved me. Honda engineering rocks! Thought my replacement car should be a little bigger and the CR-V fits the bill. New Accord looks nice but was just too big, too wide for what I need. I've already bought about $600 in accessories to make my CR-V MINE!","The overall design, the quality of the finish (really like the Japan built models), the color (got the Glacier Blue).",Make the driver seat height adjustment only raise the seat not simultaneously push the seat forward (there is a separate control for that already). Tall drivers like me need the extra height to gain leg room.
5,Best SUV for your Money!!,Lynn's Suv ,10/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We love the CRV period! Test drove the Ford Escape and the Toyota RAV4. The Honda CRV is very smooth in accelerating, handles the winding roads where we live with ease. The ergonomics inside the CRV are terrific. Love the looks of the exterior. For your money you cannot go wrong with this 4WD, seats are very comfortable, can see out of all areas of the inside cabin, there are no blind spots. You won't regret getting this Honda CRV!","The seats are comfortable and I like how the back seats slide forward or backward for larger, or smaller people. The drive train is very impressive also! ","Fog lamps should be standard on EX model, other than that, exceptional vehicle, Honda did a good job on this SUV."
4.75,Back to Honda,Consumer2007 ,10/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I was searching for a 2007 Honda or Toyota as replacement to my Volvo 850  since June in anticipation of expensive repairs.  After a few twists and turns settled on a 2008 CR-V. I have driven less than 600 miles, my impressions are: Rear styling is similar to my Volvo 850 and its side profile is growing on me. The glacier blue looks good in many different lightings. Curve handling is surprisingly good, the bright headlights make me feel safe with night time driving. Seat is reasonably supportive for hours of driving. Everything feels solid and no rattling. Road and wind noises are minimal especially with audio on. Easy ingress and ingress. A viable alternative to a luxury wagon.","Allows internal access to rear without exiting. Fuel/ trip monitor to maximize MPG efficiency. Spacious and low clearance to lift heavy items into the car. Cruise control on steering wheel, wider tires to improve handling. Top rated safety features as standard equipments. Reliable and less costly.","Integrate the antenna with windows. Include privacy glass to LX model. Easier way to interpret required maintenance works. Make the rear pillar window larger and eliminate the blind spots, especially with high profile car seats in place. continue to improve the MPG and make it drive more like a car."
