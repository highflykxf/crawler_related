Driven short distances in town and long trips to Louisiana. Air conditioning has never been touched and works great today. Leather interior is still great. Never a problem with belts or handles and the exterior paint(Champagne) is still shining as the day I bought it. Acceleration has improved with age. The sun roof works perfect as does the cruise control, lights, radio, cd changer, and Sirius radio. I recently put new Bridgestone Potenzas and brake pads. The tires I had removed showed absolutely no suspension or alignment problems. The rotors did not need attention either. Nothing on the car has given any problem except the one sun visor I replaced for 36 bucks. The remote trunk release, the steering wheel controls an the remote fobs all continue to work flawlessly. This has been a value that I will not part with as I intend to buy another Hyundai soon to replace my Van.",,

The car is about 8 years old now and I have only done basic maintenance and put tires and new headlights in due to the wax formation. Everything works. Sound system sounds great, and I love that the unit holds 6 cd's. If I could buy this car again when I need a new car I would. Drove to north Carolina, Flordia (separate trip), tenesee (separate trip) and would NOT be afraid to drive to California from rhode island. The car has 161,000 miles on it so I expect problems soon due to use and age. I do not see poor quality in material.

I have the V6 and when getting into the FWY's no issues plenty of zip and easy handling, just made a cross country run of 2,900+ miles and it ran better than expected, really didn't check mileage but it was probably around 30+MPG.

Overall it is a great vehicle but there are reasons for my non 5 star review.First I have a fully loaded platinum edition and there was no nav installed. That's a huge ding for me (Hyundai seems to have fixed this with new models). Second the paintis EXTREMELY thin so when you get a door ding it takes off every layer of paint. and the whole exterior of the car seems like they went and raided other manufacturers parts bins to throw it together... it has a little of every brand in it if you pay attention. having said that it is a great car and it does what it's built to do. And I would reccomend it.,"It has a powerful V6 which is nice, almost perfect driver positioning, handles more like a family car with softer suspension, HUGE trunk (It's a grocery getter), I have the Infinity sound and it is AMAZING, turning radius is more than adequate, for a V6 it gets very good fuel mileage, The car is extremely quiet on the highway which is a first for me. It's very nice not hearing a bunch of road noise (in ND no less)

This car would be a PERFECT starter car for teens (in the 4cyl model). ","they seemed to have fixed alot of this with newer models but here goes:

1). for me the suspension is softer than I like (its great for the family aspect but i love being able to drive fast on my own :)

2). The paint- its great until you get a door ding.
Then every layer of is comes off... never seen this until I bought this vehicle

3). No nav... I explained this above

4). some of the interior pieces do seem very cheaply made.
For a fully loaded Platinum Edition I expected much better quality.
I do take extremely good care of my vehicles though so this shouldnt be a problem.

5). I'm still on the dealers oil change w/ convent. oil but it seems to get dirty quick... more to come on this"

Most of the fluids where not at the proper level. I topped them myself rather than drive 40 miles back. The engine luggs at 40 MPH when in top gear. Suspension handles bumps in a way that feels odd like the tires are bouncing over the bumps. The dealer claims an oil change is needed every 3000 miles and the company backs this up but when I first got the car they said 3000 only for severe use. Now they say everything in the US is severe.  I had 2 mechanical problems with a tire pressure detector malfunction and a brake problem. Their ""best warranty"" did not cover anything. ",The car looks nice and gets reasonable mileage. The trunk is big.,Install a gauge to indicate when a oil change is needed. Put platinum plugs in all vehicles. Better warranty. Reasonable maintenance intervals.

However, I made the decision to get the Sonata and once the dealer agreed to my terms.....no $$ down, zero percent interest, and payments under $300 for the Limited, its was a done deal.

For years I've wanted a 4 cylinder with a 5 spd that was fun & value packed for a reasonable price, a la Hondas of years past.  I had heard about the big rebates and called a dealer for a quote.  They had the car I wanted in NC.  The dealership sent drivers to get it and bring it back to Atlanta.  Then they installed black leather and delivered it to my office for free.  The paper work was as agreed, so no drama there.  They threw in tires for life (sweet!) and I got it for less than 18 grand out the door which is just unreal.

With the first 2 fill ups we are averaging between 28.5 and 29.5 mpg with our 4 cylinder with automatic tranny in mixed driving. I am anxious to see what the mileage will be on a longer trip. Every time I drive it, I marvel at how solid the car is.

The average mileage for my test drive was 26mpg. I really would love it to be close to 29-30 mpg, but I can live with it since I drive only 20 miles to and from work each day and once month a trip of about 220 miles.

There are several problems: (a) a lot of rattles on the front side of the car. This is ridiculous for a car with only 1500 miles, and says something about its build quality. (b) the infamous rear suspension problem seems not fixed even for this 2008 model. When I drive it at a imperfect road at 30-40 mph, I simply cannot bear it. I have to choose a longer route to work because of this problem. (c) when the oil tank is full, it makes noises, and the dealership told me that the cure is not to get a full tank.

Even though this is the cheapest model it still comes with all the safety features as standard. The car drives great, quiet and smooth. Very comfortable and roomy. I am getting 32 MPG with this car, I guess the 5 speed helps here. I averaged 35 MPG with my much smaller Elantra. This is excellent economy for such a large car. Pretty quick for a four cylinder too. I love the stereo, burned a CD with 125 MP3's and the stereo played them perfectly. Just a great value in a mid size car.","Great combination of comfort, performance and economy. Nice build quality. Good Stereo that plays MP3's. Love the styling too.",Need a 6 speed manual for the 4 and 6 cylinder engines. Stereo needs an aux jack for MP3 players. The manual adjustment on the drivers seat could be better.

However, I am very disappointed with the passenger airbag occupant detection system.  There is a sensor in the passenger seat that is supposed to detect if an adult is sitting in the seat so that the computer can determine whether or not the passenger airbag should inflate in a collision.  The problem is that the system is very inconsistent and sometimes will turn off the airbag even when a heavy adult is sitting in the seat.  Hyndai knows the problem and the owners manual tells you to keep restarting the engine to clear the problem, which can't be good for your starter.  The other work around is to have the front passenger move to rear!!!","cost, standard features, safety features","fix the passenger airbag system like they have it in Honda CR-V, smoother shifting 4 speed automatic or a 5 speed automatic for the 4 cylinder model."

5,Hyundai has come a loooong way,racerjae ,01/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My first car I drove was a Hyundai Excel.  What a nightmare driving that thing!  In less than 20 years, Hyundai is truly a quality manufacturer, and it shows in their cars such as the Sonata.  The Sonata is comparable to the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, but costs thousands less.  Plus you get the best warranty out there.  It's truly a 'best buy' in my opinion. Every time I drive it, I almost forget that I'm driving a Hyundai.  It has a smooth supple ride, acceleration is sufficient (although the engine buzzes a bit at higher RPMs), it handles and brakes well, and it's quiet inside.  It can easily seat five adults, and the trunk is huge.

I didn't like the look of the new Elantras so I looked at the Sonata.  I LOVE it.  It's safe, reliable, beautiful to look at... I can't say enough good things about this car.  I put 4500 miles on it in 3 months.  The XM is a lifesaver in traffic (I live in DC).  I really can't explain how safe I feel in this car.  The warranty is fabulous.  We go on a lot of road trips and the new car hasn't let us down yet.

Wasn't even sure I could make it to the next gas station as it continued to drop. Made it though. Next day, Passenger airbag light off message came on. Third day, light comes on even though I am the only person in the car. Forth day, I look up the issue and see it is a long- standing issue with Hyundai's that apparently hasn't been fixed yet.

Some low quality plastics in the interior.  Even my 93 camry and 89 civic had better materials.  So you can't compete with camcords, but then again I didn't want to pay 7 grands extra for camcord anyway.   Highway ride is smooth, city driving is not bad either except for fuel economy and a little harsh ride on bigger bumps.   No engine noise, tire noise is bearable and so is the wind noise.  We had a wind storm the other day and some gusts were blowing even more than 50 miles per hour and I didn't feel any cross winds except for wind noise.",More car for your money and fun ride.,"Could use better interior materials.

5,Eye Opening Car,SmilinSquid ,12/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I recently bought a 2007 Audi A4 for 30K dollars. Nice car and I love it. Went to the Hyundai dealer recently and bought a 2008 Limited Sonata for my recently widowed mother. WOW! The Sonata is a VERY nice vehicle! The fit and finish is impeccable, and the V6 has plenty of pep. The exterior lines and dual exhausts are quite attractive. The 5 year warranty and standard safety features, along with Hyundai's vastly improved record for quality (JD Power reports) nearly sold the vehicle by themselves.  Having driven it, I can't help but think I overpaid for my Audi! The leather seats, quality components and user- friendly controls are nearly on par with my A4. Hyundai hit this one out of the park!","Fit and finish. No sqeaks or rattles. Feels very comfortable and solid. The V6 will scat. Appearance, inside and out, is sporty but refined. Few family sedans are as attractive when viewed from behind. The standard safety features provide peace of mind. Trunk is HUGE. Every detail says QUALITY.

The Sonata provided the best value, mileage is a little less than advertised but overall I really like this car.  The limited package has most of the bells and whistles.  The engine provides more power than I expected but when you ""punch"" it at speed it feels like a four cylinder (about what you expect). ","The stereo system is great and the XM feature is nice. Handling is good and interior layout is nice.  Seating room in back is pretty good, I am tall and it is better than most.","Need more legroom in front for taller drivers (it is adequate for most).

She let me borrow the car for a few trips and I fell in love with it.  With the offer of 0% financing I decided to trade in my 1999 Taurus and purchase one for myself.  I decided to go with the inline 4 instead of the V6 because of the threat of ever increasing gas prices.  In the short time that I have had the car, I haven't regretted going for the 4.

The ride is smooth and the V6 engine provides ample power (234 HP). The interior design shows quality and there are safety features galore. In addition, the gas mileage is reasonable.

Ride is firm when necessary and feels cushy on the highway. Road noise is average, but cabin comfort is fantastic.
