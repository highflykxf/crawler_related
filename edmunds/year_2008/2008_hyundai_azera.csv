What a value for the bucks (less than $20K).  And I always get looks and comments.  Minor annoyances: driver's seat doesn't go back far enough; bumps are over exaggerated.  But all in all it's more than likely the best car I've ever owned (and I've owned about 15).  Nothing to think about.  If you're looking for a great car at a great price - Azera's your only real choice.  I'm even thinking about getting another one.  ",Ride (as long as I'm on smooth road).  Look.

And the car drives like it is on a track, unbelievable.  Got the tires out the door for $400.  Great deal; great tire; finally great handling and cruising and silence - blessed silence.

I have only had only one unusual problem - had a broken tooth on the timing gear, it was replaced under warranty. Otherwise it has been perfectly reliable.

I don't understand. Was looking forward to driving this car. Like Hyundai, but I would look at a Sonata.  Mine has twice the miles and no rattles.  Oh, turned the radio up so I couldn't hear the rattles and the Infinity radio is pretty bad too.  This one pulls to the right, maybe it's been wrecked since its a loaner car?",POWER!

There are no rattles or squeaks anywhere and it feels like it will stay that way forever.  My children love the back seat - comfortable seats with lots of room.  The truck is huge!   All of the controls are logically laid out and I did not have to go to school to figure everything out.   I Cruise at 72 - 78 on the interstate and the car is stable, quiet, great visibility all around and I average 25 - 26 mpg at this speed.   I love the styling, it is understated, but classic.",Comfortable seating with lots of room. Logical controls.  Stable handling.  Great engine performance.  Trunk with lots of space.  ,"I would prefer slightly firmer suspension, but I really can't complain handling which is accurate and stable.  "
4.75,Bang for the Buck,bradstew ,01/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I needed a quiet, comfortable car that I take on long trips.  I looked at luxury models including Lexus and Mercedes. For about $15K less, the Azera compares favorably.  It's smooth and powerful, and most importantly, quiet.  Gas mileage is decent--about 21-22 around town and 27 on the highway.  Quality is outstanding.  And the engine is responsive and powerful.","All your luxury accouterments are there including fully adjustable seats, pedals, mirrors, seat heaters.  The only option I don't have are the hands-free dialer and the Nav package.  But I have them already.  ",Just one.  Why didn't they add an external audio jack so I could use my MP3 player.  Very annoying.
4.875,Just WONDERFUL!!,racraine1 ,10/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I (like others) went to get a Sonata. I'd researched the vehicle thoroughly and found it to be just what I wanted. I climbed in and thought it fine, but my girlfriend thought it looked a little small. the salesman then took us on a test drive of the Azera and it was love at first drive. The ride, comfort and extras teat come in the Lilmited edition put the car right up against the stiffest competition. I cannot say enough good things about the car.","Rear sun shade, room for all passengers, (I took some friends out for an evening and the three ladies in back ALL said they had more than enough room and were VERY comfortable, even the one in the middle), responsive handling, TRUNK SPACE!!!","I found after driving it for a couple of weeks that my mileage wasn't that good. (18.5 mpg) I checked the tire pressure and the recommended was 35 psi. I have high performance tires with a max pressure of 51 psi, so I increased my pressure to 45 and immediately got 3 more mpg. Maybe research that?"
4.875,Love This Vehicle,Gary ,10/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Great value.  I'm not sure why, but I was able to buy this vehicle for about $3,000 below dealer cost.  I've never driven a new car off the lot and have the ability to go trade it in for a profit.  That aside, what a find.  Great power, smooth ride, awesome sound system, sunroof, navigation.  My wife drives a BMW X3 and I prefer to drive this vehicle.  That pretty much sums it up.","Sound System, navigation is great, acceleration and knowing that I paid thousands less than other brands.",Make the wood steering wheel standard.
4.625,High Quality Car,Andy ,08/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I bought my 2008 Hyundai Azera in June of 2008.  And so far with about a month and a half of driving the car, I still enjoy the ride and its features.  It took me a while to find out all the features it had. The ride is smooth and the comfort is great with leather seats.  I really enjoy the LG Navigation system, this way I won't get lost anymore.  There were a number of reviews I read before and after buying the car, and overall they speak well of the car, however they point a little about the steering.  I find the handling and steering to be fine. I guess the only thing I could complain about is that there are a few squeaks and rattles from the car when going over bumps, which is annoying.","Automatic rain-sensing wipers, this is a great safety feature as you won't have to worry about adjusting the wipers when it rains, you can keep your eyes on the road and not get distracted.  I also like the navigation system, rear sunshade, plenty of head and leg room in front and rear, and sunroof.","Try to improve the gas mileage.  I love the large tank of 19.8 gal, however I've been getting only about 300-315 miles on one tank, and that could be a little better.  Try to fix the squeaks and rattles from the interior plastics, it's just a slight nuisance.  Overall, I highly recommend this car."
4.625,best deal,matt b ,07/16/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I spent a lot of time on line researching the purchase of a second car. Hyundai warranty is very persuasive. Had all the intentions of getting a 09 sonata limited with the navigation option. After a very satisfying demo of the sonata, I made the mistake of sitting in a 2008 leftover azera. This car wowed me right away. After some negotiating, I was able to purchase the azera limited, with the ultimate nav. Option for an "" out the door "" price of $27,500. This made it about $2,500 more than the sonata, and it is very well worth it. It is a beautiful ride, and you really need nothing more.",,
5,What a great car!!,Paul J ,07/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We went to the Hyundai dealership to look at the Sonata and while it is a great car, was not big enough for our family. We the looked at the Azera and drove it. We found that the car drove and ran excellent. More power than the Sonata, and my 6'1"" son can sit behind me in the back seat and still have leg room. The car rides excellent, looks great, and gets decent gas milage, considering it's size and horsepower output. At many thousands of dollars less than the competition, this car sticks out as an EXCELLENT alternative. The warranty doesn't hurt anything either! ","Rear sun screen, XM radio, moonroof ... the list goes on.","The bluetooth handsfree is not connected into the stereo system, so you have to mute the radio instead of it automatically doing it when answering the phone."
5,Great Rental - might consider buying,Vacationeer ,07/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"An excellent car.  We rented the Azera for a trip around the Northwest. I was initially skeptical about having a Hyundai (even with only 7 miles on it), but that wore off immediately.  We could fit 5 suitcases, a full size stroller (folded) in the trunk and two kids in the back seat comfortably.  Our round trip was from Portland, around the Olympic Peninsula, to Seattle and back to Portland.  Whether cruising on 101 or climbing mountain roads to over 5000 feet, the Azera gave a smooth, comfortable, and powerful ride.  MPG was quite reasonable for a full size car.","Power rear sunshade (there was a ""heat wave"" on our trip to the Northwest.  The SHIFTRONIC transmission was great on the mountain roads and behind retirees on Hwy 101.",Can't think of any... maybe a built in ATM?
5,08 Azera,dwengier77 ,04/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love the car.  Drives really smoothly, and has great acceleration. All the safety features are great, because I pick up my kids from school, so now I can feel more comfortable knowing that they are more protected. Looked at the Avalon, maxima, acura tl, and merc. C300 series. For the price I got the most with the azera and I have the safety net of the 10 year warranty. Definitely give it a test drive and it will be on your short list as well. ","Auto dimming mirror, auto lights, auto wipers, memory seats, exterior design, great power curve",get rid of the green back lit radio
5,best,BEST CAR ,04/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I get so many people that look at my car. I get mileage in the high 20s. And now they have the option of the navigation. And its great. Love the wood and the power folding mirrors and the rain sensing wipers. I also like the seat memory for the mirrors and sterring wheel. And the sunshade in the back is great. Best price for this much stuff.,"nav, seats, space, sound system, heated seats, moonroof, power folding mirrors with signal indicator , air vents for the back seats",power trunk. rear air controls. thats all.
5,Azera is a Good Automobile,Jim Cole ,03/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have driven my new Azera for 3 weeks. So far,I love it. Powerful,smooth,noiseless ride. I wanted the white ,But not in stock. I purchased the Titanium Blue. How lucky was I??? The blue is soooo rich looking. To own a car for 10-20000 dollars less than I was expecting to pay is a huge bonus. Hyundai makes a fine product. I ...Will write a comment in about 6 months,after the break in period. ","Color, ride,good looking curb appeal. The finest radio I have Ever heard.  Of course it is the 605 watt Infinity with 12 (count em 12)speakes.",I can't think of any after three weeks..But none at this time
4.75,Great car so far,wolfrat1 ,03/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"This will be my third Hyundai. We have come up the line from elantra,sonata and now the azera. This is an excellent riding vehicle. Very quiet. There is some road noise but I'm attributing that to the tires. Not a lot of people who rated this car like the michelin mxv4 plus tires. I will be taking them off. It handles well,great pickup from the engine. Very,very roomy. Great trunk space. The basic stereo system could use more power. The XM portion doesn't come through very loud. The steering wheel volume control are kind of hidden. Still these are minor problems that wouldn't stop me from buying another azera. It shouldn't stop you either. Take one for a spin. ",Interior is great as is the ride. Very responsive.,"Steering wheel controls,more power to the factory radio in the GLS version. Cup holders could be just a little smaller. "
4.75,great ride!,show-off ,03/18/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,I'm 23 and I like my 08 azera. It is a nice pearl white but very hard to keep clean. I like the power of the 3.3 liter 234 hp engine. Spins its tires easily. Love shiftronic is good for redlining it.0-60(timed myself) is 7.8 seconds. Ugly alloy wheels.,"color when its spotless(barely), engine, quietness, shiftronic","ugly rims, better stereo"
5,Luxury for Less,HyonAzera ,03/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The 2008 Azera Limited (with the Ultimate  Package)is one fine automobile.  You can own an excellent, reliable, comfortable, powerful and safe auto for thousands less than the other ""driveway dressing"" brands. You'll turn some heads (and leave them at the starting line)in your Azzie.  It has so many upscale refinements. Very well designed and the mechanicals (transmission and engine performance) behave like a refined auto costing much more. Quiet, comfortable cabin. And a great warranty. If you're looking for a great car at a great price, check out the Azera.  Do your homework, give it a drive and you'll see...big bang for your hard-earned buck. ","Too many to choose just one.  When you sit down to read all the features on this car, be sure to set aside enough time...there are many.","A more readily accessible a/c outlet on/near the drivers dash to plug in the radar detector. The fuse box is in the engine compartment, so no easy hard-wire option."
4.875,great,betch ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,This car has power for a 3.3 liter 234 hp engine. It pulls very easy and easy to spin its tires. Got 2 speeding tickets on a freeway going 110mph because it is so quiet in the car. Love pearl white paint and beige inside. My dad wasn't too pleased that i got this because he knows that i would fly in it. Wheels could be bigger. Never thought i would want a Hyundai.,"power, color, lots of room, quietness of engine, new car smell lol:)","Stereo could be better, put veracruz's 6 speed automatic. At least 17 inch wheels"
