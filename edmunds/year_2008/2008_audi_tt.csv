Paid as much for it as I could have for a NEW fully equiped GTI which is a similar car since they share the same platform, engine and technology. After almost a year of ownership I don't regret buying the used TT over a new GTI. The exterior and interior styling combined with the lighter weight chasis makes the difference for me. The only penalty I feel is the cargo space but I have a second car for the days when I need it. Major big plus is that I average 400 miles to a tank and I'm not a light footed driver. I do about 50/50 city, highway driving and I love to get on the throttle as much as possible. ",Interior and exterior styling. Gas mileage. Performance and handling. ,"Steering feedback.

I've been looking at it since they came out and have just been waiting for the right price on a used one. The car is quick and handles great. It's very comfortable considering it's size. The interior is roomy for the front passengers. The back seats are fine for really small children for short durations. Bose sound system isn't horrible,but it could use more bottom end. The only thing my car didn't have was the nav. I mostly wanted it for the display and the SD card readers, but the 6 disc mp3 changer in the dash works well.  It displays text unlike the ipod interface. Torque makes driving the manual easier in traffic.",engine performance.  The throttle response is much better than the 2.0T. The car sticks to the road like glue. Magnetic ride really does something and I recommend getting it. The car is beautiful and fun to drive. The engine and exhaust sound great!,They discontinued this V6 model.  22 mpg isn't stellar.  Redesign to have direct injection like in the other Audi V6's.  More bass from the stereo.  Better ipod interface or a radio that can read AAC files from CD or SD card.

Now there is a recall for that part(s). I'm over 6 feet but I sit comfortably in this convertible. Kicking myself for not purchasing the Audi Care Service for $740 in IL.  Maybe they will let me buy it before the 15k service? Love the paddle shifters.  Hate the Ipod interface.  I have to guess at the playlist, album, artists. My wife used regular unleaded against my wishes and it has not affected my 28mpg! Where can I get some track time and properly learn how to push this car to its limits.",Great fuel economy. 28 mpg on regular or premium! Drive it year round on all-season tires. Better than rear-axle Porsche. Comfortable for us tall guys. Synthetic suede is nice and not as hot as leather in the summer and not as cold in the winter.  Seats heat quickly. Brakes are good.,"Navi is small, sits too low, poor graphics, and functions are as old as the petro in the fuel tank. Skip it! Leather upgrade doesn't get you a lot and wears poorly. No seat position memory for a second driver. Massive skid plate with a special bolt and internal cabin filter requires dealer service."
4.625,The TT is a good car.,Allan ,02/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"My previous cars were a 2005 Lotus Elise and a 2000 Boxster S before that. I need a 4 seater for my baby son and the TT was the only car that really interested me short of a 911.  Comparatively, the TT is very capable in the real world. Its handling is decent, however the steering a bit light and there's too much understeer in the canyons.  Acceleration is decent and brake is excellent.  Storage is adequate.  It's a good daily driver car.  I did compare payment to a similar spec VW GTi (no interest in it but just doing due diligence) and the TT is about $125 more a month so it's not a bad deal.","Adaptive headlights, magnetic ride, and DSG.  Exterior & interior styling and attention to details are good too.","The Quattro version needs to put more power to the rear wheels. Currently, it's more of a gloried front wheel drive.  Also, steering wheel needs more feedback at lower speeds. It's a bit vague."

Handles like a dream and the dual clutch tranny is by far the best feature.  Would buy a 4 cylinder if buying new, but wanted to Quattro and saved.  08 3.2 was my only option for Quattro given used and value.  As for gas mileage, averaging about 22 and am happy with it.  It hard to compare the gas mileage in my mind when this thing wants to run well above the speed limit.  If you want to push it off the line every time then the numbers will drop, and yes, so will they in any car.

Wow, what a difference a decade makes. I am amazed at the power of the 2.0T, along with the smoothnessof the whole vehicle. I've owned Audi's for over 25 years, so I am a fan - but of course there are some things that could be improved.","Gas mileage, power, handling, seats all come to mind but it does have some usable new electronic features that make it an Audi.","Make more phone adapters for that center mounted interface, or get rid of it. Seriously, why did you put it there if you weren't going to support it better?

But when the redesigned TT model came out, I couldn't resist. The 2008 coupe (3.2 quattro with S-tronic) is a step above the previous models in every respect: power, handling, styling, sophistication, fun. I especially like the smoothness of the S-tronic, which hesitated quite a bit in the last two cars I had. The larger interior is just enough to make friends say it no longer feels cramped. ","Design, interior, engine, quattro, S-tronic, automatic spoiler. It hugs the road and corners like a panther. Engine growl is perfect.","I-Pod connection is rudimentary. Can't see play lists, song titles, etc. Had I known, I would have opted for CD player.  Unused cradle for phone is amazingly unsightly for such an upscale car. Audi could have figure a solution to cover this."
5,Highly Recommended!,ABG ,08/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a nice little car. Convenient as the size allows easy parking everywhere. Gas mileage is acceptable, not as good as the 2.0 version. Interior is outstanding (enhanced leather interior), the rear seats work well with my 2 children (ages 9 and 6) for short rides. The suspension feels a little harsh (I don't have magnetic suspension), which might be a deal breaker for some. However, no car is perfect and this one is not the exception.  ","This thing sticks to the pavement like a bubblegum. What is dangerous is that one is tempted to challenge the car, but so far TT is winning all challenges I've made! Ipod interface is great (wish it could recognize the tracks). Love the steering. And of course, the looks!","Please Audi, change that Nav system! Extremely complex to use! It takes 5-10 minutes just to type an address. Sound system is also unimpressive. The phone cradle in center console completely useless.

I have yet to test the S drive and the S tronic though, but the D drive has been exciting so far ",The new slick headlights.,"Like all new cars, I need to get used to the size of the car.

It's perfect for her petite size and I know she loves getting all the attention. The handling is great, it wants to be driven and before she knows it the spolier pops up and she notices that she's going 80 miles plus. The trunk is big enough for a weekend trip.

It is a real eye turner also. Drives well in the city and runs like a scalded dog when you put your foot into it on the interstate. I love when the automatic spooler goes up at 75mph (you can manually do it also in town ) and people point at you with amazement as you pass.",Curb appeal and warranty. The Roadster has a huge truck.

After having owned three 225hp TT Roadster before I have to admit I really like the sound of the engine. Compared to the 225hp experiences before however this 6cyl consumes considerably more fuel (hwy 25 vs hwy 29). Obviously the first TT almost made me a die-hard TT fan, but there have been considerable improvements to the new generation, such as a larger trunk (no lie: it can manage two gold bags), a better top, great GPS and customizable computer. Needless to say that I just love the design. All wheel makes it a safer ride even under challenging circumstances.","I love and never want to miss again the 2-SD slots (that come with the optional GPS). Handling and power, design, body integrity are upper class.","Well, I'd love to see the FSI concept on the 6cyl, too.

The gusty exhaust note is what I listen to most when I drive, though the basic factory stereo sounds great. Bought the car for Quattro and when I had a FWD A3 for loaner, it was apparent I made the right decision.

I plan to install an air intake system and rework the exhaust in the near future. The car will be a project, with mods installed as they come to market. I may even put in a higher- performance turbo in the future, with nitrous being considered. ","DSG is a blast with more shift modes than I ever had b4, RPM blip up is great.  Sirius satellite with 6-CD changer and Bose system has really nice sound and features.  18-inch wheels and fat Pirelli tires perform nicely.

I would also rather have an iPod port and simple cable (such extension cables are scarcely available) to connect my iPod b/c I have to disrobe it to insert it into the provided dock."
5,Best car I've ever had!,James ,07/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I've had the new Audi TT Roadster for around 2 weeks and it is by far the best car I have ever owned! I've had the Z4 and the 2006 Boxster and none of the come even close to the 2008 TT Roadster. Everything about this car is flawless!,"The exterior and interior design, plenty of room for me at 6'3"", great fuel economy, fun to drive (especially in ""Sport"" mode!), great performance, people always watch when you drve by, handling is awesome too and I love the iPod adapter! The nav system is awesome and I love my 18"" wheels!",None needed!
5,Awesome Car,2008TTGuy ,06/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have only had the car for 2 days but I am in love! After test driving several the Infiniti G35X, Acura TL Type S, BMW 328xi I was set to buy the TL-S when I stopped by my Audi dealer.  When I saw the new 2008 TT coupe, I stopped dead in my tracks - I don't think there is a better looking car on the road.  I drove both the 3.2 Quattro and 2.0T and while the former has a little extra punch and impeccable handling, the 2.0T was plenty strong and nimble.  And it fit my wallet better.  I have a hard time finding any faults with the TT, but even a harder time wiping the smile off my face when driving it.  I truly think this car is a good value compared to the competition.",The looks the car gets as it smoothly zips through 75 MPH and the rear spoiler raises; the feel of being securely hugged by the top-notch leather bucket seats; the precision of the racing steering wheel; the top quality interior; the ultra fast gear shifting and lack of turbo lag.,
5,Best Car I Have EVER Driven,WillieJ ,03/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I drove this car today at work and I have to say it's the best car I have ever driven in my life.  It's really solid, stable in the corners, pretty good ride for a sports car with performance tires.  The exterior design is exceptional.  Plenty of interior room for me, being 6'1""","The satellite radio standard, iPod jack, safety features and much more.","The gas and brake pedal are too close for someone with bigger feet.  Other then that, great car!"
