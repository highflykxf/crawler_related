5,The best Tahoe i have ever had.,John ,07/25/2016,,5,,,,5,5,5,5,,,I have owned my 08 hybrid Tahoe for about 8 years and has been a great suv for my family it drives great  and is highly recommended mine has just hit 200000 miles and never has had problems just a few minor recalls you can fit 8 perfectly please get one it is the best.,,
3,Wasn't what I thought it would be.,Carlos ,11/14/2015,2,3,3,,,2,3,3,4,,,"There are a bunch of other problems that you get with this purchase. First, you lose a lot of standard features that come on cheaper models of this vehicle. Convenience features like automatic lift gate and luggage rack, and safety features like a spare tire and jack. Also, if you get a bad hybrid generator (battery pack) like I did you're screwed. I tried several times to have it replaced while it was under warranty and GM came up with all types of excuses why it wasn't the battery pack. But once the warranty went out they said that the new battery pack would be about $5k. The battery pack controls EVERYTHING.. When it goes everything will run intermittently. And they will gradually die off at a very high expense to safety. For example: The computer that controls the interchange between gas and electric motors will cut the car off when you try to go after stops for lifts or signs. So you will cut off intersections and sometimes in slow or stop-no-go traffic. Mine has cut off thing to cross intersections with vehicles coming. I have to hold down the brake and rev the gas (Almost like in a manual transmission) to keep it from going to electric to avoid this. Which defeats the purpose of the hybrid because you still burn the extra fuel. It's just not worth it.",,
3,"Honest Review, 2008 Tahoe Hybrid, Owned 5 yrs",Thomas ,09/04/2015,3,1,3,,,2,5,3,3,,,"2008 Tahoe Hybrid, birch metallic.  Just sold it after 5 yrs ownership, bitter sweet ... Honestly, I bought this big truck for its looks.  And because I have 3 kids so I needed something bigger.  Im also a car guy so I just cant spend $30 or $40 k and have to look at a minivan in my driveway.  Im a man, so I do like to mow the lawn, wash the truck, and have a beer in the yard and admire both.  This truck allowed me to check that box.  The magnesium alloy 18"" wheels are beautiful and the box shape was so anti-minivan I just had to have it.  The Tahoe had a legendary reputation.  I also found my Hybrid model at a dealer off trade in for $35K with only 12K miles on it.   Made the decision easy.Good :The looks.  If you dont like the boxy GMT900 style, dont get it.  Its the single most appealing feature.  Its exterior far outshines the bland, big Pilot looking Expedition.  The Durango in that time frame looked like it was built in the early 1900's.  Nothing from the Germans came anywhere close for the price (or features).  The looks of this vehicle sells it (and all those cheesy Hybrid decals come off easily using a hair dryer).The ride was also great, I was dumbfounded as to how a body on frame vehicle could cruise at 85 mpg as if it were an Audi.  Very impressive body dampening. Engine reliability was perfect for 90k miles.  And the 6L V8 with electric motors assisting would really rocket this vehicle to dangerous speeds.  Good thing it was limited to 96 mph, I often found myself hitting that limiter as the truck felt like it was good for much much more.   Now with the good comes the bad.  This is a heavy, dumb, clumsy, body on frame truck.  Make no mistake about that.  You are sacrificing vastly superior minivan and unibody drivability and mall parking lot maneuverability  in big sums to own this truck.  Its 39' turning radius is abysmal.  Ingress/egress is also more difficult because it rides higher up.  The 2wd model I owned was LESS capable off road than a Yugo GVX.  It seemed like 90% of the weight rode on the front axle, and they drive the rear wheels.  Dont take the 2wd version even into a dry lawn.  OK what else ... the transmission had a ""clunkiness"" that just got to my nerves eventually.  It would sometimes get confused between hybrid mode, 4 cylinder, and 8 cylinder modes.  This would result in driveline shutters and clunks that just should not of been there in a vehicle costing $55k new.The rear diff was replaced under extended warranty at 80K miles.  The entire rear diff, all the gears, bearings, bushings, everything.  I never towed anything.You have of course read about the infamous cracked dash issues.  I wont go into that, but mine was nearly cracked in 2.  All the door locks failed repeatedly.  Thankfully we found GruvenParts.com making the reliable replacements, never had a problem since.The Nav and OnStar, while it all functioned fine, was far behind the times (and still is).  I miss the truck, mainly for its stunner looks.  Sadly its reliablity and driveability left so much to be desired.  I wonder if the 2015 model is better, I still see they use a live rear axle.  I hope they didnt just reshape the sheet metal and slap a $70K sticker price on it.  If they did, GM has no merit to receive another bail out.  Cmon guys you can do far better...I would not buy another GM, ever.  Mainly due to the repeated interactions with GM customer service on the dash and door locks.  They have hired off shore contractors to hire customer service who know nothing and care nothing about the US owners.  With the dash, they directed me to a local dealer, then told me it was entirely up to them.  I sat down with the service manager and he said why the heck is it my problem ?  I agreed.  The dash is flawed, GM should cover it, not give owners of $55K trucks a circle jerk.  I will not buy another because of this.  Sorry.",,

Not many issues, other than a recent engine light on for an emissions issue. It's a very reliable car, mileage is CONSISTENTLY 20-21 no matter where or how I am driving. Wonderful family car.

4.875,best SUV out there,SF bay area ,01/14/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car has performed to all expectations.  We tow a large ski boat with absolutely no problems and still hold to abut 14 mpg.  Regular driving holds around 23 mpg.  We have had very few issues in the past year and a half.  Power door lock and two recalls.  I was apparently one of the first to purchase the vehicle in the area so one or two recalls was normal.  Only improvements that had to be done was additional headrest monitors, tranny cooler and removing of the hybrid decals.  This car was worth every penny and save me a lot in gas compared to my old Tahoe.","GPS system, MPG, power and handling, extremely low road noise","power gate, spare tire kit, removal of side decals, increased front end clearance, improvement on the entertainment system(kids have a hard time viewing, USB bluetooth support"
4.875,Its Great!,East Atlanta ,11/17/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We purchased the Tahoe Hybrid to enjoy the comfort, space and anticipated gas savings. We have truly enjoyed its performance and handling. We had issues with the brakes, but they were fixed. We also had the decals removed.  The mileage is satisfactory, but its great in a lot of stop and go and on the highways; it averages in the low 400 miles per tank. ",The powering down of the engine at stops is nice (albeit it takes some getting used to).  ,
4.75,Great SUV,Cory ,11/09/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,5,4,"Great for an SUV.  I average about 21 MPG of mixed city/Hwy.  The hybrid system is smooth but not seamless.  There is an occasional clunk when when the engine disengages.  I have had the truck on every type of terrain, including snow, mountains, and mud.  It performs as well as any modern SUV, just remember, it is no jeep.","Mileage, 3rd row (at least for kids), ride and handling.",Needs factory roof rack option - I had it installed.  Low clearance in front scraps often.  Needs auto leveling rear suspension.  Still not as spacious as a minivan.
5,Great SUV,Tom ,07/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We had a 2001 Chevy Tahoe that we liked very much. When it was time to trade we checked out the Chevy Tahoe Hybrid. We really love the truck, we call it the magic carpet ride because it rides so smooth. Wind noise is minimal and the power is great for a full size SUV. Recently we took it on a trip pulling our 6,000lb boat and trailer, I hardly knew the trailer was on the back of the vehicle. After 180 miles one way, we arrived as if we had been riding without the trailer. I own a 2003 Dodge 2500 with Hemi engine, that truck beats us to death and it does not pull the trailer with the ease of this vehicle. We also got between 12.5 and 14.3 MPG, the truck would get 9.5 MPG.","Leather seats are very comfortable and the rear camera makes trailer hookup a breeze when you have to do it alone. Love the increased gas mileage, we get 20 to 21 most of the time, we have seen 22 to 23 if we drive around 65 on the interstate, that's hard to do with the smooth ride.","Chevy should take off the stupid decals that come on the truck, we did. It makes it look like a traveling billboard. Also, they should look at raising the front air dam a couple of inches, some of the parking curbs will rub. Otherwise great vehicle....."
4.375,Loving the fuel efficiency!,TreeHugger ,06/08/2009,,,5,3,4,5,,4,5,5,4,"I've gotta say for the fuel efficiency, hands down, the best. Traded my old Range Rover for it & I'm super happy about my gas mileage but it is BIG. Bigger than any other vehicle I've had. The rear camera needs improvement (the angle and range are off). The rear sensors are not as sensitive as they should be (minor fender bender backed into a small car) But I get 30+ on the highway easy. Trust me, I'm always checking. They were very modest with the mpg. So whenever I'm in Atl or DC traffic, I'm laughing at the suckers who are burning up their money lol. Took the 3rd row seats out, there's no room for storage with them in.  ",Fuel Efficiency,"Smaller size, like regular Tahoe. Fix rear camera, the angle is off.

5,MyBrid!,CJ ,03/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had 2 other gas Tahoe's since 2004 and the #1 question I get when someone notices I have a Hybrid is ""does it have any power?"", and the second of course is ""what kind of gas mileage do you really get"". I'm always very proud to say it's more powerful than either of my 2 previous gas Tahoe's and I get 19-21 in town, and about the same on longer trips. I had the dealership remove all the decals on body, and removed the windshield decals myself with a hair dryer & WD40 (it really works!). The only thing I miss is my power tailgate.

First, every time i filled the gas tank up, the truck missed and wouldnt run.  Something was wrong with the gas tank which allowed it to fill up too much. Second, a sensor went out causing me to almost not stop in a parking lot. Then, the hybrid system in the transmission went out. Now, my driver side rear door won't open and im taking it in tomorrow. Finally, I only average 16mpg city. This is nowhere near the 21 advertised on the sticker when I bought it. ",Truck looks good. Nice electronics inside. OnStar. ,Fix all the problems!

I had my eye on an 07 Tahoe when I purchased this one and I am so glad I did. Not to mention the black is fabulous! I have seen the ones with the hybrid decals, but mine did not come with those and I am glad. The gas mileage has proved better than the minivan we previously owned.

4.75,Still fond of this SUV after one year,Craig ,02/09/2009,,,4,5,5,4,,5,5,5,5,"I have enjoyed this vehicle very much, especially during the summer of '08 when gas hit $4.00 a gallon. It rides very well, has lots of room and is quiet after 45,000 miles. I have had it in for extra service 3 times due to the hybrid transmission failing - first the modulator, then the transmission itself, then the modulator again. Fortunately the failures occurred close to home and the dealer was terrific in getting it repaired quickly. I am willing to put up with the hassle to get the excellent mileage for a full sized SUV.","OnStar, GPS system, good sound system, backup camera, electric outlet at tailgate",I have not had a flat but having no spare tire concerns me
5,Great Choice,JTK ,02/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded an 07 Tahoe LTZ on this hybrid. It's great sitting at a stand- still and still having cold A/C while burning no fuel. The 4WD works great.  I miss the rain sense wipers, memory seats, and power tailgate, but I love getting 4-5mpg more than on the all gas Tahoe.  Especially since this one has more power than the engine on a regular Tahoe.  I've saved some 25% on my gas useage, and since it was >$4.00/gal last summer and fall that adds up to a lot of money. The ride is great and it pulls my trailer effortlessly. I bought as soon as it was available so I did have a recall to replace something in the hybrid system, but they put me in a Caddy while it was in the shop, so OK.","Cold A/C while in hybrid mode. 2-mode hybrid system that helps even when in 4WD, and the gas engine is running.

I avg. 21.3 city driving and almost 24 highway. The hybrid technology has changed the way I drive in that I am not as aggressive a driver as I once was; saving much more on fuel economy. I totally recommend hybrids. Great purchase even though people think a large SUV Hybrid is an oxymoron.,Hybrid technogy. I can virtually drive from the main road into my development and to my house on battery power alone.,Hybrid decals are unnecessary. Hybrid emblems are enough. I want to have them removed.
4.625,A great ride,rdstoll ,04/17/2008,,,5,4,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"For a vehicle this size it is relatively quick and a fun ride.  Handling is good, and most importantly, the mileage thus-far is performing up to stated claims. You can tell it is a hybrid as you drive it at lower speeds since it feels like you're driving an electric golf cart. Sometimes, there is hesitation from a dead stop as it decides whether to use electric, gas, or a combo of the two to get the truck moving. A minor quibble. Interior controls are intuitive and easy to figure out. It lacks some bells and whistles that vehicles of this price tend to have, however, such a programmed seating, heated outside mirrors, and 6-disc CD player. All in all, I love it!","Mileage that meets/exceeds stated claims. Smooth ride, even over rougher surfaces. Good acceleration and torque at passing speeds. Comfortable interior seats. Attractive exterior design.",Get rid of all the decals - we know it's a hybrid! I had all the 'hybrid' decals on the side and front/back windows removed. Third-row seats not built for anyone but kids and I wish they would figure out a better way to lay-flat or removed the back seats. Better door latches; have to slam doors.
