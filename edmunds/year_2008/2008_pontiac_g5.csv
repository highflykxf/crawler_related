I have had mine for 2 years and other than one minor repair it has been extremely reliable.   It is one of the smoothest driving cars I've ever driven and everyone who drives it says the same.   The interior is comfy, no noise, no rattles, not cheap.   The back seat feels much larger than it looks and dips down giving more room for rear passengers.   Battery is in the trunk, no big deal.

The one thing that set me over the edge is that the battery is in the trunk. That is really not a problem, until you combine that with the whole anti theft thing where when your battery is unhooked or dies, your key gets stuck in the ignition. How are you supposed to get to your dead or unhooked battery that is in your trunk with the key stuck in the ignition? Seriously?

Steering wheel tilts up & to ctr. level but not down. Seats are rock hard & have no cushion or give to them. Speedometer has this silly high arch in dashboard above it that makes it hard to see  if you're short. If you raise seat up high to better reach steering wheel, legs are then jacked up at ackward numbing angle making it hard to reach down to pedals. ","Not much to brag about. Only thing I liked was auto lights and digital info. features that displays outside temp, mpg, tire pressure, etc. And engine is quiet, that's about it.","Add center cup holders; make deeper console bin, taller gear shift, get rid of arch above speedometer.

Wish I had researched before buying. My main reason for choosing it was the ""good deal"" (rebates). Sorry GM, but I'm done now. Just bought a Mazda.","Nice ""heavy car"" ride for a medium sized vehicle. Decent power and fuel economy (I averaged 29 combined with a fairly heavy foot).

Anyways, I drive my car 90 miles round trip to school and it's never left me on the side of road. In the year i've had it though, its been to the shop twice for annoying squeeks. One is in the rear brakes (they said nothing was wrong), and the sunroof squeeks. Also, when i make a turn the car twist and pops the sunroof out of the roof. The crome on the door handles peeled off. The warranty for Pontiac is nice, but not bringing it in for repairs.","The exterior look, definately the radio, LOVE the tire pressure sensors, and my leather seats!","Couls have made cruise control a standard feature, the opening of the trunk is too small to fit my cooler for day trips to beach =( And if you're anything like me, Mrs. Daredevil, do not try to pass as this car is slow as a slug!"
