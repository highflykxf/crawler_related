5,More trunk room than my '01 Maxima!,John Wilson ,07/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Two months into this car with a little over 4200 miles on the odometer.  Only negative was a bad AC compressor at 2k miles but was fixed within 4 hours.   Car drives and rides nice with plenty of room for the family including the boys baseball gear and a couple of chairs.  I was looking at used Pontiac G6s when I found this one and couldn't be happier.  Average mileage with 5 speed with mostly city driving is a low of 25 mpg and a high of 29 mpg so far with things only looking better as the car gets more broken in.  So much better than the Maxima at 19 - 23 mpg which also asked for premium fuel.   VERY happy with my new MAZDA6! ,Gas mileage. Comfort. Smooth shifting manual transmission. Cloth interior is of good quality and very comfortable.   ,Paint chips easily - better clear coat needed.  Floor mats are starting to show wear already.  Bought all-weather Mazda mats but should come standard.   better insulation in floor and ceiling. When it rains it sounds very hollow in the roof area.  Spin on oil filter instead of canister filter.
4.75,Great car for the money,zoomzoom84 ,06/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"The Value Edition comes very noticeable and usable features such as a power front driver seat, 6 cd changer, and 17"" alloys. This immediately puts the Mazda above many of its 4 cylinder competitors. The ride is smooth, the seats are great for sitting in traffic and long road trips, and I've averaged between 28-32 MPG for mixed driving! The styling is very trendy and the black casing for the tailights and headlights make it look extra sporty! This car is perfect for both commuting to/from work and for cruising around the city. The 5 speed manual shifts smoothly out of 1st and you can really feel the power at the top of 2nd and throughout 3rd. Engine is powerful enough for a 2.3L, 4 cylinder.","The multi-function steering wheel allows you to switch between different audio modes, volume, tracks, and there's a mute button! All very cool. The sound system thumps pretty loud for some stock speakers! Also, the backseat is spacious for a couple of buddies and the trunk could probably fit 2 more!","The turning radius on this car is horrible. Making a U-turn onto a two lane road requires effort and it has sometimes required a 3 point turn if the turn is miscalculated. Also, when you steer the wheel to the extreme left or right, you really feel the car start to squeak."
4.875,Fun little car to drive,Padre52 ,06/08/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Love the mileage & performance of my new mazda 6 with the 2.3 4cyl. Very comfortable to drive, I drive nearly 200 miles per day. My one complaint is the red lighting and location of clock, radio station info, if the sun is shining through the windshield you can't see any of the information. Miss the automatic door-locks and headlights from my previous vehicle.",Bose stero system.,"Get rid of the red instrument lighting. Reposition the angle or add visor at top of clock, radio information center to be able to see it better in daytime driving."
4.125,Great choice,Rich ,06/06/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,3,4,5,5,"Feeling the gas price crunch, I had to look at getting rid of my FX35 and get something with mileage. Looked at Accord, Camry, Altima, Fusion, Malibu, and finally came across Mazda. This is a fun car to drive, the steering is a little overboosted, but great mileage (avg 24mpg mixed), good brakes, comfortable, but a little sluggish. Feels lighter and smaller than it is. Glad I bought it, and saving lots of money each month!","Styling, seats are comfy, base stereo is adequate, steering response.","Back seat a little tight, sluggish off the line, but then I have been driving a 300hp SUV for 2 years. I need an adjustment period."
4.625,Greatest Deal Ever!!,sanfranchinaman ,05/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"Car is beautifully equipped with Value Edition that includes alloys, 50 series Michelins, 6-cd changer, ABS, traction control, tire pressure monitoring system, split fold down rear seat, power w/dl,dual tip exhaust, and a sporty look.",Looks and drivability.  The low profile 50 series Michelins provide good cornering and performance.  Audio system appears to be very good. Like the 8-way power driver's seat and sufficient rear passenger leg room. The 18 gallon tank will provide >500 miles on the highway for trips to Yosemite.,Most new cars provide auto door locks once the vehicle has been put into gear.  This should be a standard feature for this car. No audio jack for MP3 player is a big omission for this 2008 model for Mazda.
4.5,Really Like It!!,Go Mazda Go! ,05/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,3,4,4,5,"Just bought a Mazda6, went from a Acura TL 2004 to this but gas prices were killing me, I do miss the power of the TL's V6 but this Mazda6 is really good looking and gives me a very decent mileage. I love the black on black combination. I was surprised at the quality of the cloth material used in the seats. I compared to the Camry and even though the Camry its bigger with a more powerful engine and better gas mileage the pricing factor makes the Mazda a better deal, I bought mine for 16,200 and it comes with 6 discs cd changer, 17 inches rims with michelin tires, dual exhaust system, well it is pretty loaded and for 16,200 WOW!!","CD changer, dual exhaust, black on black combination, leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob","Better engine, more horsepower with more miles per gallon."
4.125,3 Months later,Robert145 ,05/14/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,4,4,I'm enjoying the car. I did notice that it does not have a good tight turning radius. I have been on the highways somewhat. Very quiet comfortable ride. The glove box is small. I miss the compass on the rear view mirror.,"Nothing special. I would like a subtle sound that lets you know the car is locked. The only way you know is to watch the parking lamps blink once. If you do it twice, you get the horn and at 5AM, I'd rather not do that.","A better turning radius. When you push auto on the climate control, the A/C automatically comes on even if you have the thermostat set to 75° - then you have to turn off the A/C manually every time. It gets annoying."
4.875,Couldn't be any happier,Brian ,05/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased my '08 Mazda6 GTS within the last few weeks; I took delivery on Saturday 5/3. This car flies down the road without even noticing it. In addition, I tell people it is like you are floating and not even driving cause of how amazing the ride is. On the GT it has the ""cockpit red"" for all the gauges and readouts which keeps things clear and easy on the eyes, esp at night. The Bose sound system is ridiculous which definitely gets people's attention when driving with the windows down. The leather seats are very comfortable and you can sit in them for a prolonged time without aching or stiffening up. The HID headlights are awesome for night driving clearly lighting up the road.","For all the research and time I took for my new car purchase, this was worth it like I can't believe. I love the entire car and everything in it so I don't have ""favorite features.""","Memory control for front seats, built-in iPod hookup, center console lid to hide the cup-holders when not in use."
4.25,Disappointed,dyna ,05/09/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,4,5,"Actually, this probably isn't a bad little car. The problem may be that I'm comparing it to my previous car, a Saab 9-3, which cost the SAME amount of money to lease as the Mazda! I guess I didn't appreciate it's turbo engine and excellent gas mileage while I had it. I'm certainly feeling like I'm getting less for the same price. The Mazda's a ""cute"" car, but not overly impressive for the price. It's slow on the uptake, but rides nicely once it gets going.  The seats are comfy and it definitely is a fun car to drive. The dash, however, looks like what it is, cheap plastic. Frankly, I'm having ""leaser's remorse"".  Unfortunately I have another 3 years in this car.",I love the Bose Sound System and the mute button on the steering wheel.  Vision out the front window is great.,"Automatic power door locks! Also, the stereo system doesn't have text, showing the song title and artist.  The automatic headlights really aren't automatic...just on all of the time.  A more colorful dash (less bright red) would be great."

4.125,Owned almost 3 weeks,Mary Lou ,05/02/2008,,,3,4,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"So far I like the car, very sporty. Rides and handles nice, good pick up for a 4 cylinder. Good visibility, no obstructions, can see very well even with spoiler.","I like the wheels, power mirrors, 6 disc CD changer and nice size glove box. Also the controls on the steering wheel are convenient. The temperature indicator and compass is neat too.","Would like auto locks, I'm used to the doors locking upon entry. Also a larger sunroof that opens wider.  I'd like to have power seats on passenger side too. Would change position of headrests, they hit the back of my head. Driver's side can be adjusted by moving seat back but not passenger side."
3.5,Fun to Drive and Good Value,CCD ,05/01/2008,,,3,4,3,3,,4,3,3,5,"The Mazda6 is an excellent value.  I bought the car loaded with everything except nav.  Yet the car still lacks an upscale feel. The real appeal of this car is the handling which is outstanding for this type of car and the versatility of the hatch.  With a more powerful motor, this car could have been exceptional.  With the 6 cylinder engine, it is just a lot of fun to drive.  A bigger motor would have really given the car a strong identity.",Hatch back and handling.,More power!
4.625,One Day Old,Suzanne ,04/22/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Just traded in my V6 Grand Am GT gas hog for a 2008 6I Sport Value Sedan.  So far so good! Body styles are very similar. I like the sporty sedan style, but need ample backseat room for a carseat and passengers. I like the dash setup and there is still storage for my car clutter. My very favorite perk is the remote start, which works even from inside my office, =>100 ft away! Haven't decided whether or not I really love the VERY quiet engine (the vvrroooommm of a V6 is a beautiful thing!); the pickup is pretty good for a V4. Most of my miles are highway, so I'm looking forward to not having to visit the gas station so often. This isn't so much a 'fun' car; I'll leave that to my Jeep Wrangler!","The 8-way power drivers seat, 6 CD changer, ample backseats, and ambient temp reading is great! My husband was glad to see me in a car with side bags/curtains. I love the sporty look; I wouldn't be caught in a car designed for 'soccer moms' (although this car would do very nicely for them as well!)","Running lights. Fog lights. Automatic door locks. Jack for iPod (like the Mazda 3i). Redesign the key (way too big/heavy). Include a valet key. I know Sirius&XM are merging, but my account was already with XM--give me a choice. Sirius radio is not intuitive; the Sirius info button is hard to reach."
4.375,Nice Car for the money,raddad2 ,03/27/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"I just bought the 6-Sport Value edition.  I really like the car's exterior appearance.  Mine is black with the rear spoiler.  Interior is nice but not overwhelming.  I did not look at the upgraded models so I don't want to rate the interior too much since mine is pretty much just standard equipment but is still comfortable enough for the daily commute.  The sunroof is nice but not really needed much in Seattle area.  The drive is nice even with the small 4 cyl. 2.3 lt. engine, smooth shifting and gets up to speed just fine.  Headroom is a little tight if your a taller person and rear seat area is a little cramped but is fine for a family with two young children.  Fun to drive... zoom-zoom!",Sporty exterior including headlight assembly.  In dash 6 CD changer and power sunroof are nice features.  Overall driving experience is fun.,"I own two Mazdas, the '08 6 and a '07 CX9 neither have the automatic locking doors or a meter for fuel telling you how many miles there are left in the tank like my previous two vehicles that were 6 and 7 years older.  Fuel economy is good but not as good as I had expected from either Mazda."
5,2008 Mazda 6i Grand Touring,Robert145 ,02/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"So far, so good. I've only driven it about 600 mi. but according to my numbers, I'm getting more like 27 mpg around town. I have tested it at 1/4 tank and 1/2 tank. Being an 18 gal. tank, I'm averaging 500 mi. per tank. I haven't had the car on the highway yet. Time will tell. The car is very responsive and fun to drive. Very comfortable to drive. The 8 way drivers seat offers good adjustments. I'm 6'1"" tall with long legs. Plenty of room.","I went for the 6i Grand Touring simply because it had all the options, except for the GPS which I didnt want for $2,000. Their website showed a digital compass on the rear view mirror but was not included in the actual car.",None so far.
5,What a Ride!!,Kathy ,02/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had my Mazda6 for a week and I absolutely LOVE it!  It handles well, it's quiet and my blended gas mileage for the first tank was 26 mpg.  The heater works great, too!!  I had an Acura Integra, but had to ""grow up"" a little bit.  The Mazda6 was the right choice for me because I now have an automatic instead of a stick and can actually get more than 2 people in my car comfortably!  It looks great, too!","Remote keyless entry, audio controls in the steering wheel, sharp styling, gas mileage.","Need a dome light somewhere in the back seat - with my black interior (which I love), it's very dark in the back seat at night when I'm getting my briefcase and other things out of the car."
4.875,Absolutely love it,Favorite car ,12/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My Mazda 6 is the most fun car I have ever had. The 5 speed manual paired with the torquey V6 makes the car a dream to drive, but is not to overbearing to the point you can't use it as a family car. It is very roomy inside, plenty of room for kids in the back, and the trunk is vast. Could use just a little more in the way of economy though. Otherwise a phenomenal car!",Exterior and interior aesthetics are great. Looks great inside and out. 5 speed manual is so much fun. ,Maybe come out with a multi-displacement engine?
4.875,My first Mazda purchase,My first Mazda ,10/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The V6 is the only engine to get in this car, but Mazda needs to squeeze more mileage out of each gallon of gas, the way Toyota powerplants do. Traction control system is great. Comfortable size car, and agile. Looks great, too. Quality of materials is good and the quality of the finished product is very good.",Grand Touring trim level is more upscale than I expected.  ,"Needs to get more miles out of a gallon of gas. My wife has a new Camry with a bigger and more powerful V6 than this Mazda, and the Camry gets better mileage. "

It has all the power I need, with a manual shift option.  Disc brakes on all four wheels are also standard.  I love the way it looks inside and out.  Mine is black with tan interior.  it is fun to drive and for the price, you can't beat it.  The Mazda6 comes standard with 17"" alloy rims .  The mazda is smooth, luxurious, fun drive.  Overall, happy!!!","Dual exhaust give it a real nice smooth ride.  Love the way it looks on the outside and inside.  Love the standard 17"" alloys and 4 wheel disc brakes.  Love the controls on the tilt wheel.  The only thing that I think it could improve on is the sound system.  At high volume it isnt great.",Better sound system.
