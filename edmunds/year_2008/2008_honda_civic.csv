With 209,000 miles, I have never replaced anything except the tires (Kumho Solus) at 106,000 and 195,000 miles, the brakes once at 113,000 miles and the ac clutch coil & compressor at ~165,000 ($2,500 combined cost). That's it. Going mostly hwy miles between 65 and 85 mph, I average 39 mpg. The car is deceptively fast when you need it and feels safe at speed. With the manual, it seems you can go from 65 to 95 in seconds. Only gripes: It is not great in snow. Some of the power door locks don't work, I've disabled them all. Uses about 2 quarts of oil in between 9,000 mile oil changes and the most annoying thing: the radio volume goes up & down with your speed and I cannot find a way to fix that.",,
5,Hands down the best bang for your buck,Comiche ,07/21/2016,25,5,5,,,5,5,4,4,,,"This review will be a little biased as I've always been a Honda owner.  My previous car was a 1986 Honda Accord DX Sedan which saw me through my college years.  Had it not been for me totaling my 86 Accord at an intersection, I'd probably still be driving it.  It passed on at about 375000 miles.  I purchased my 2008 Civic LX Sedan at the end of 2008.  It currently has 150000 miles on the odometer which means it's just starting to stretch it's legs in Honda terms.  So far I've had to replace the starter which, because my car was under warranty, was replaced by the dealer.  Other than that all I have to say is that the car is very reliable, comfortable, and moderately fuel efficient.  I say moderately fuel efficient because today's cars are very fuel efficient with the introduction of hybrid and electric cars to the market.  Those that complain about the car's lack of performance need to take a hard look at themselves in the mirror and ask, 'are you an idiot?'  If you want to own a Civic and want performance, it's called the Si model.  Every other model other then the Si is built for fuel efficiency.  Great car, tough to beat compared to it's competitors, great value, absolutely the best bang for your buck.",,

5,Just bought a 2008 Civic LX,BllG ,11/03/2015,5,4,5,,,4,5,4,4,,,"Bought a used Civic last week for my daughter.  Got a good deal at 113000 miles and wanted to post for others that might be lookng at this car to let you know how it has held up.Body was in great shape - a few minor dings and what not but no paint chipping, fade, or peeling.  No rust.  Interior, which has been critized, has held up well.  No scratches or anything detracting from the interior.  Cruise control, A/C, displays, radio, etc., all working with no issues.  Also, I'm 6'2"" and have zero issues sitting in the front seats...back seats might be an issue but driving it I'm very comfortable.Engine still runs strong, no leaks, and the transmission shifts very smoothly even under full acceleration onto the interstate.  Plus, these vehicles have a timing chain vice belt, so you don't have to concern yourself with the inevitable 100,000 mile, $1000, timing belt replacement.  Power steering works great with no noise from the power steering pump.  Car tracks straight and true down the road and handlng is solid.  You definitely feel the bumps in the road but this isn't a luxury car with the associated suspension.  Engine does vibrate and you can feel it sitting at a stop light esp with the A/C on.  But, again, it's a 4 cyl and it isn't really distracting.Road noise is definitely there on the highway but I don't sense there are any leaks through the weather stripping...it's just an economy car.  Couple of issues that are to be expected with this car's history.  The passenger side visor had failed...a quick fix through Amazon at $50.  Also, the starter, no kidding, quit the same day we bought it.  Don't naively send your wife off to the store to get the battery replaced because the car won't start without a jump...you'll wind up replacing a perfectly good battery when its really the starter.  I've always done minor maintenance like this on my vehicles but after seeing what was involved (starter placed above the front axle and exhaust) I took it to a shop to get replaced.  Getting lazy in my old age.  Also, and this is unique to my car I'm sure, what I thought might be a simple alignment to fix an off-center steering wheel resulted in the removal and adjustment of the steering column...all told, about $450 to get everything fixed.  Driver's side power steering boot is leaking and there is a minor rattling, knocking sound when we turn all the way to the right...will probably have to replace that sometime but not today.  Flushed the power steering fluid...helped somewhat but not totally.So, am I pleased with the car?  Yes...with a whole week with my daughter driving it.  But the engine works well, transmission shifts very well, the A/C and everything else is holding up well (knock on wood).  Believe it will be a good car for my daughter as she finishes H.S. and moves onto college.So, if you are wondering about this car with over 7 years on it, I think its held up very well.   Definitely one to check out for a new driver.",,

I have taken my car to the dealer for all recommended maintenance and have been very satisfied. I feel that my money was well spent when I purchased this vehicle.

3.75,"Dead Reliable, just not an enthusasts car",68oramac1 ,02/14/2015,,,4,3,4,5,,3,4,4,3," I bought my '08 LX in June of 2012 with just under 92,000 miles on the clock. Now, it has 134,000 miles and is still going strong. I have had only minor issues with the Civic overall eg. visors and clutch master cylinder. The car is very spacious compared to others in the class, which was helpful being 6'2"". The only exception is the placement of the e-brake being where you rest your leg, which you get used to rather quickly. 
 I hardly ever drop below 30mpg even in mixed driving. But it does come at a cost, below 4000 rpm, you are lucky to have as much torque as a mid 80's Mazda Rotary engine at idle! The lack of torque can make it a chore to drive around town/city. ","Overall, the Civic is a solid dead reliable economy car that will save you a bit of money at the pump. Compared to its competitors, Honda has maintained their status as very quality driven and did I mention reliable? But, for the enthusiast looking for the most fun driving experience in an economy car, I would look elsewhere. (Mazda 3) Test drove a Mazda3, Scion TC, and Civic Si at the time of purchase. On a side note, the Si has V6 power above 5000 RPM and handles like a go kart, along no torque below that, it is not worth the money up front or on insurance. Still a decent all around car. 
","Right after buying the car I had to fix the driver side visor, since it was separating as others have noted. Word of advice, look up how to repair them on Youtube for next to nothing. Other than that and normal maintenance, had to replace the clutch master cylinder and slave (which felt like crap early on). The factory clutch master's only have a plastic piston riding in an aluminum bore, which is why they crap out so easily. Replacing the factory system with a EM1 (2000 Civic Si clutch master) and integrating a stainless line will solve the problem. Similar to alot of modern drive by wire cars, the throttle response can be measured with a sundial. "
2.625,2008 Civic Coupe LX,kmat1 ,01/05/2015,,,1,2,1,2,,4,4,3,4,"I have owned this car for five years now and there are a few complaints. Just like others have stated, the driver's side visor is broken. I've also seen this defect in other 2008 civic coupes. The rear tires are cupped. This happened within a year of owning the car with only 30,000 miles on it. Two years ago, the automatic locks started to work intermittently. Most of the time I have to manually unlock the doors, and reach over to unlock passenger side. The dashboard is digital and the gas gauge works sometimes, but most of the time it's flickering on and off. The A/C works intermittently. When it's very hot outside, it's guaranteed not to work.

4.125,A Good College Car,andrew_kaber08 ,01/04/2015,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,5,"My 2008 Civic Si Coupe was a great car; but it was just a college car. It was fast, quick on its feet, had an amazing audio system, and popular with the teenage and young-twenties crowd, but it always felt unrefined. The engine provides a surprising bit of power, but only high in the rpm's, and had no down-low power. Driving it in stop-and-go traffic was a chore due to very low torque, but once you got in the 6,000 to 8,000 rpm range, it FLEW. This car is an amazing college vehicle, especially with the standard sunroof and subwoofer, but it's just unrefined. Lots of wind noise, road bumps, and interior quality hiccups (such as a ticking CD-player) prevent it from being a ""professional"" car.","Amazing handling, rev-happy engine, standard subwoofer and sunroof, great power-to-weight ratio, probably the most fun to drive out of any car I have ever owned.","More torque, more focus on interior quality, more sound deadening (reduce road noise), improve fuel economy (it only gets about 23mpg on premium-required fuel)"

Ride is slightly bumpy, compared to full size sedans. Drove 10 hours straight from Toronto to Queens, averaging 90mph all the way, and the car gave no problems. Was a very fun drive winding along the mountains at high speed. Fuel efficiency decreases substantially at higher speeds. Sad to see others writing poor comments, they must have received the bad apples, because otherwise the car follows the tradition for exceptional quality for me.","Very fast acceleration from standstill, independent suspension allows for effortless cornering without slowing down, reliability is SOLID even with all the beating I put thru it, spacious interior for its class, trunk space sufficient for multiple passengers in long journeys. ","Stock speakers are absolutely crap. Barely any bass in high volume. Ride is slightly bumpy, but bearable.

4,Very Solid High MPG Car,bobbichen ,03/04/2011,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I puchased this unit used, recently in very good condition. ($13k, 44k miles). Hybrids are certainly a different breed of cat.They drive a bit differently, though I like the driving dynamics much better than the Prius. (Brakes seem ""grabby"" and steering doesn't fit me; HCH has a telescoping and tilt wheel that allows a more aggressive steering position).I find the car to be plenty peppy as to acceleration.Handling and braking are very good in my opinion.Car feels sporty.Hybrid system is a little distracting, and does some odd things (sudden battery ""dumps"" at times, MPG drops on cold weather). Ride is a bit stiff, bordering on harsh on poor pavement.","Gas mileage is very good in town.
With regular car tires set at 40 psi, I get about 35 mpg in warmer weather (above 45 degrees) in mostly city stop and go traffic.
The system clearly dislikes cold weather as MPG drops into the 20s below 30 degrees or so.
I like the instrument column.
Seats in back are decent and truck is also fairly large.
If your battery drops charge you can simply pull over, put in Park, and rev up to 2500+ and battery will quickly recharge in a few minutes.
Car is best for moderate climate with rolling to flat terrain (Colorado mountains would likely be a problem).
Vehicles are soft on resale vs. Prius and a good value IMHO.","Hybrid charging is a little distracting and could lead to an accident.
Have to police yourself.
The audio speakers are an embarrassment.
I have seen bigger magnets in Fisher Price branded products.
I replaced the front and rear speakers for about $100 and 3 or 4 hours of my time, but it should come with decent speakers considering that HCH was priced in the mid 20s originally.
Seats are a bit firm and suspension might be a little softer (though likely that way to maximize MPG). Auto stop can be a real hassle in parking situations.
Needs a button to toggle it off during such maneuvers.
A lot of traffic about battery failures on internet and this site.
No problems so far."

We recently averaged 39 mpg over a 2200 mile trip much of it through mountainous terrain.  My best mileage was at 45 mpg over a newly paved interstate.  The smoothness of the road helps in delivering good mileage.  And driving at the posted interstate speed of 70 MPH does not diminish the mpg. The Civic averages about 28 mpg in town.  ,Holds the road very well in curves and during turns.  Very aerodynamic! Very comfortable suspension.  Adjustable steering wheel pushes in and pulls out as well as up and down.,My only complaint is that the EX trim should come standard with a lumbar control for the driver's seat.  Climbing into the driver's seat is like that of a race car.  I wish it were easier to get into the seat.

My only complaint is the speaker system could be a tad bit better and I can't see the hood so it makes parallel parking kinda hard but definitely not a deal breaker for me. If you are looking for a stylish, reliable small car then the Civic is the way to go!","Moonroof, Aux connection, acceleration, tight turning and maneuverability, gas mileage","better speakers, better visibility for parallel parking"

The interior design is cool but materials used are very cheap feeling. The ride was loud on the highway and bumpy to say the least.

The interior has a great design for the speedometer, easily readable in all lighting conditions. The arm rest slides forward for short people like me.

It drove exactly the same as the brand new one I drove with 5 miles on it, so I save myself about $7,000.  What can I say? It's a great car, I love driving it, the engine sounds awesome when over 6k RPM, and it will take spirited driving with no issues. Did an autocross event last weekend, and that was ridiculously fun. The car gets 28-30mpg, and feels faster than it is. Certainly fast enough for me.  I have had no issues with the shifter, the stock stereo is decent, and the car handles great.

4.25,Winter Performance,palmdove ,01/14/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,5,5,I have been very happy with my 2008 Civic since I purchased it last fall.  It was slightly used as it was the demo car at the dealership.  I only started to have a problem when the snow and cold weather arrived last winter.  I found that the design of the wheel wells does not leave room to clear away built up snow and ice.  I find it gathers there and makes turning difficult at times.  It is very hard to clear it away as the area is so tight.  On other cars it's easy to just tap it away with your foot etc.  I've discovered the only real way of clearing it is with a high pressure hose.  I do find this a bit of a design flaw and maybe could be improved!,I love my km display etc.  The beautiful blue colour is so easy on the eyes.  I also love the oil change monitor...it's so cool!,Already mentioned in previous statement.

It consistently delivers better gas mileage than the sticker (36-37 mpg) and is still fun to drive. The build quality and refinement are top notch and the manual transmission provides smooth, short throw shifts.  In my opinion, the Civic is a much better design both inside and out than other cars in the segment.  I've put 40k miles on this car in just 21 months and it continues to perform like it did when I drove it off the dealer's lot.","Styling, fuel economy, the ""auto-up"" feature on the driver's side window, build quality, blue lighting behind the dash",You have to be very cautious when backing up and driving in parking lots as there are many blind spots in this car; the rear defroster just never seems to get the job fully done.

I don't think there is a better car out there for the money.  I consistently get close to 30 mpg in town and the car handles almost as well as my G35's and that is no joke.  The seats are actually more comfortable than the G35's, holding you in place firmly but offering great support during longer trips.   I would highly recommend this car.

I was fighting to keep mileage above 49 mpg when I went in to have new tires and oil change at 30,000 miles.  Up to that point, I had never gotten less than 50 MPG (measures by dividing miles driven by gallons of gas to fill up).  This included summer and winter driving, city and town.  Immediately after tires (original?) and oil change I had difficulty getting 40MPG.  I am now fighting to get above 35MPG.  Dealer claims to have checked out and can find nothing wrong.

I love the dash layout, I'm a big guy though and the seats are a bit narrow. Quick around town, but on a recent trip on route 66 to California I noticed on long inclines you have to put pedal to the floor. Lots of ""zip"" but horrible acceleration in situations where you pull a U-Turn and have to gun it... almost got hit a couple times because even to the floor it's just so slow getting up to speed. Transmission has inconvenient shift patterns too. That's the only bad, all in all it's great little car and I get over 400MPG on the highway!!!","Interior design and dash display is a big positive for me, I really like the 2 tier setup. Excellent fuel economy. VERY, VERY solid build compared to Suzuki, Ford, and most others in the same price range. Very solid car with quiet tight interior.","Transmission! Honda, please make this car shift faster in stop and go situations!!! At 4 way stops and much of the time I manually shift my car and it's automatic. I have to because the transmission is geared strange and don't shift fast enough for my style of driving. More HP!!!!!"
3.25,Honda Civic Problems,Mo ,09/09/2009,,,4,4,2,2,,3,3,5,3,"I downsized from a '06 Audi A4 to a Civic. This car has been nothing but problems. When I bought the car, part of the bumper was scratched and the dealer fixed it. Then my struts were making a creaking noises within weeks of buying the car, the dealer replaced the struts. I complained a couple of times about the air smelling horrible when the A/C was on and they couldn't fix it (they couldn't smell it).  The car started to make a ticking noise within the past week and took it into a dealer close to my work. With 31k on the car, the dealer is telling me that I have burned out the clutch and I have to pay $500 for a new clutch! This is a junk car and would not recommend this car.",,

The Civic isn't a muscle car like the STI, or a demanding, purpose-built sports car like the S2000, but it is a well executed sports coupe. It is fast when I want it to be, but it's a Civic when that's appropriate. The suspension is well tuned, the front wheel drive works surprisingly well, the brakes are reasonably good, and having the 6000- 8000 vtec power band is fun and effective. The navi system and premium stereo are both treats. All in all, a well executed package. I will keep this one for 5-7 years.","Versatility, handling, interior styling. The engine is a marvel, although it lacks the raw power of the S2000, the ecu tuning has produced a power plant with an amazing functional range--it putts perfectly, and screams when necessary. Well done Honda!","The brakes are good but not great-- they're a bit grabby and don't modulate as well as they could. I have a couple of dashboard creaks that seem out of place in a $20000+ car.

This car really is a joy.  I am a college student, so the extra space afforded by the 4 door is helpful, although if anyone is not restricted by space I would recommend the coupe.  It is far more attractive and I will most likely go for that when the lease is up.  The car is quite low on torque to be honest, but one the cams switch over the car really becomes a beast and the sound is beautiful.  If you do not like revving up your engine past 6k then you will never enjoy this car, and you might as well look elsewhere.  Great ride, smooth, reliable, decently quick.","Shifter, seats, red lighting, deep exhaust note, VTEC.","Not a big fan of the dash, but in this price range, I didn't like any other cars."

Pros: drove from Los Angeles to Dallas and got 36 hwy and up to 46 when not using the A/C, very Â“zippyÂ” and fun to drive.  Huge windshield allowing passenger to prop feet up on dash, adequate room inside and trunk.  Cons: sometimes acts like it wants to stall when idling.  Front brakes replaced at 22,000 miles (not covered by warranty).  I was told this was due to driving in LA traffic which I believe; CD player died so entire audio system replaced 8 months after purchase (covered by warranty) and lots of road noise.

Well I have been driving in the city 37 years and never had this many brake jobs in so little time.The car sits low to the ground and scrapes the front bumper when parking head in. The inside frame between the windshield and window is so thick and slanted that you can miss pedestrians in a crosswalk.

They also got very noisy before they were replaced.  This appears to be a HUGE problem for Honda.  Their solution is keep putting tires on every 18000 miles and put up with the howling tires until they are replaced. I have talked to 2 of our friends that have the same problem.

I have had no problems with the engine, drive train, body, or trim.  My only disappointment has been the drivers seat which has a one inch tear along a seam.  It is very comfortable on good roads, a little less so on bumpy roads.  At less than 20 grand for a fully optioned fuel sipper, it is a better deal than one of the hybrids.

Tires are fine and have a plan to drive 20K miles with the same tires as I purchased with at 10 miles. Some people complained about tires, I would say that the tires are fine. Also, the brakes will go out on the basis of your driving style. If you are aggressive driver and like to brake so often, I think no one brake will stay alive for a long time.

I would prefer a manual transmission but the automatic performs very well for a commuter car. I always use 87-octane gas, Royal Purple synthetic motor oil and a K&N reusable air filter in the stock intake. I have a sub in the trunk and heavier speakers upfront that probably cancel out the mpg gains from the oil/filter. Worth it to me.

I have not once had a problem with it whatsoever. It's real quiet too when you're driving unlike other loud cars. The gas by the way is amazing - I cut a lot of money off spending for gas because this car does a good job on it. Also if you like to work on cars for shows this civic is the ultimate car to do it to. I installed subs, neons, lambo doors, suicide seats, interior neon, and put things on the motor for speed. It is a great car to work on.

I live in Chicago, and around town it averages about 30 MPG when it's 30-40 degrees, and when the weather drops to single digits and below, the mpg plummets to mid 20s.

Fuel economy does depend on what kind of driving you are doing and how you drive, but I have been averaging around 35 mpg... but have gotten over 40mpg on more than one tank.

I have owned or leased almost every make vehicle including Toyota, Ford, GM and Honda.  This Honda Civic is my 3rd Honda. Of all the vehicles I have owned, by far I have had the most problems with Honda's.  The engine and transmission may be smooth and reliable, but the little annoying problems like the constant flickering of the check engine lights (all 3 have had this problem).  Very disappointed and frustrating. I've had less problems on my GM owned vehicles - far less!  These vehicles are riding on the reputation of Honda's many years ago.

As soon as the cool weather hit - bam, ran into trouble. You have to crank and crank and crank it before it finally starts and then it runs roughly before finally idling. Sometimes I crank it and just stop and wait before trying again.  Today it was -15C (5F) and the engine would not even turn over.  I turned the key all the way to ""start"" - nothing.  Engine would not even respond.  I am very disappointed in this car.  If I can't depend on it to start in the cold weather, what else can go wrong?","Excellent handling.  Very nimble around the city.  Very solid on the highway. Extremely responsive engine (better than any other I test-drove in its class; but then, it has the highest HP in the class too, 140).

However I don't think I will ever see those EPA numbers.  The car rattles so much it is embarrassing - especially when cold, this car was not made for Canadian winters!

I get between 33-38 MPG, and after one trip across the state and back, I got almost 40 MPG. I got into the Honda for the reliability factor, but I love the look, especially the color (dark blue) and the digital speedometer.

So, after almost 10 years of driving my Dodge Neon (which had been great, but didn't want to push my luck and needed a change), I decided to get a Civic. I love the styling inside and out. So, my heart was set on a Civic, but I wish I test drove the one I bought a little more. Overall, I still like it, but I've had it in the shop a couple times due to strong pulling to the right. It's better, but still seems very sensitive to the road.  Neon went straight forever. Also, there's a slight throttle hesitation when you take off from an (almost) stop. Otherwise, drive is smooth, avg 35 mpg, now @ 2000 mi.","Styling. Smooth, quiet drive. Fit and finish much better than Neon. MPG is great.  Hope that it lasts like a typical Honda is supposed to.","Alignment needs to be more thoroughly tested. Wasn't expecting this problem, so I didn't look for it when test driving.

My new Civic is just like the '98 I had before the VW. It looks different, but is just as fun, just as reliable, just as economical. The new one is more powerful. I feel at home in this new Civic and plan on keeping it for a very long time. at 160,000 miles, I drove my old Civic 3000 miles cross country to sell to a friend, not a single problem.

I decided to give the Civic a chance.  I'm glad I did!  I loved this car from my first test drive.  It is surprisingly roomy and has a peppy engine---acceleration is more than adequate.  I have only owned this car for 1 month.  3 tanks of gas with gas mileage slowly improving from 28 to 29, to 30.  This is with my A/C on ALL the time (in 100+ degrees) and with mixed highway/city driving.  I am sure gas mileage will improve.","Paint is a lot better quality than on my '03 Accord, digital odometer, expected re-sale value, (hopefully) Honda reliability like my 2 previous Hondas, gas mileage.  The Civic is also more fun to drive than my old Accord, maybe because of its smaller size.","More comfortable seats, should have trunk release on key, don't use the Ivory color for the interior (it gets way too dirty), horn is way too quiet.

Best mileage was 47 mpg with 65 mph highway night time with no A/C.  Car has been everything I hoped for!  My concerns include (1) Auto stop engine cutoff at stop light/signs on hill and car will roll back if break not fully depressed.  (2) Accelerating power at either a stopped position moving into traffic or passing at high speed is limited.  Only 2nd new car bought.  Prius wait 9 months; Civic 2 weeks.",,

Bad news: The car LOOKS hot, but it really isn't, the headroom makes people annoyed, and it isn't a luxury car (at all). The Civic coupe is best for teenagers who want 0 to 60 times of under 8 seconds, but who don't want to break their budget. It's a nice compact car that isn't so show-offy. It gets good gas mileage.

When gas prices went up these recent months I decided it was time to trade my SUV to save gas money. It took me a few weeks to get used to the small size, but now I'm hooked. The first two tanks of gas alone sold me. I am surprised how well my civic handles. I have driven it in pouring rain and not been afraid, the steering is very good. I was shocked how quickly I have gotten used to the smaller size.  The only true complaint is that since I am a tall girl (5'8"") it is kind of hard to get in and out of. Once I am in though, I'm very comfortable.","The gas mileage is great! I love that I didn't have to give up my leather (with heated seats), since the 2008 now has a leather package.

In addition the seats are comfortable in the back and in the front, even for me (I'm 5'11""). I love the styling, and the air conditioning is good. I even got cold in like 91 degree weather.

4.75,Very nice car,Mitchell Potter ,07/28/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Before buying my civic (Jun 6,08) I drove the Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla.  The Corolla was a good and I would have bought one but having two other Hondas (97 Odyssey & 97 Civic, both still going strong) it was hard to leave a good thing. My compromise was I couldn't get stability control but buying it with the Corolla would have meant having other options I didn't want. I went with the LX over the EX because I didn't want the sunroof or 5-spoke alloy wheels (just didn't like the look). However, Honda has a 15', 7-spoke wheel that is nice. I bought them and a trunk liner from College Hills Honda (on-line) for about one-half the cost my local dealer wanted.    ",Average of 37 mph so far; looks good especially with the optional wheels. Nice ride for a small car. Great reliability.  We love our Hondas!,"No stability control, no adjustable variable wipers on the LX; odd placement for parking brake; no true coin holder/box.

After constant problems with GM and fuel prices, have gone back to Honda. I'm 6'3"" 210 lbs, and I had to have the driver's seat customized and moved back 3"" to accommodate my legs. Now that I've done that it's totally comfortable. I didn't realize it was just a bit to short in legroom until a long drive, my Hondas years ago had more leg room. Other than that, a real great car. Totally worth the $ for the Si. I think the other models I would be disappointed in lack of power coming from a 3.8 V6 Grand Prix GT but this Si is even faster and performs better than the Grand Prix. Gas mileage awesome!","Style, 6 speed, 350 Watt audio system with sub-woofer (outstanding!), 17"" rims. Room for my 3 little girls in the back seat. Totally wicked car, when hitting 5500 rpm and the vtec kicks in, it's like a turbo. Very sweet ride. And I'm 34, married w/3 kids. Best family fun car out there.","Just make these with a few inches more legroom, it cost me $370 to have the seat moved back 3"" for comfort,people  only seem to be getting taller.

The fuel economy is great, the ride is tight and at 6'3"" plenty of room for a small car.  The engine is small but peppy.  The feel is tight and responsive although not overly smooth.  Only complaint is the sound system which, as written about previously, is lacking.  I upgraded the speakers to some Pioneer three ways which broadened the spectrum quite a bit.  A larger amp and sub woofer would help but is not a pressing need.  Overall this is a great car for my commute and around town needs.  Highly recommended.","Mileage (26 in around town driving, close to 31 for my commute in mixed driving).  Fun to drive.  Looks great.",A better sound system.  Move the parking brake.

This Civic is an awesome little car, roomy, zippy, comfortable.  The gas mileage is fantastic.  I have a heavy foot and it's hot where I live in the summer.  I usually set the cruise control at 75, drive 50 miles a day, 5 days a week, with the A/C on, and I've been averaging 34 mpg!

Sure, it's way more than the base Si, but a test drive of the two will let anyone know that the money was well spent on the suspension and wheels/tires.  The looks I could care less about, but the handling is absolutely superb!  Ride is harsh, as you would expect from a sports car, but the gas mileage is amazingly good (about 26 mpg in 100% city for me, even with ""spirited driving"").  The only cons for me are the lack of nav and the fact that it's a car that must be parked ""out of the way"" so as to avoid vandalism/theft. ","Suspension! Handling and QUICK steering.

As far as performance, the car handles great and I don't feel like I've sacrificed anything on the road - acceleration is better than adequate and the car rolls nicely at 80-85mph.

This is very close to what our 2004 Accord does, and the Accord is 4 years old. I was expecting MORE. It is well constructed and easy to drive. The driver seat is a little hard. I do not like the gas gauge; would prefer one that shows 1/4 1/2, 3/4 and full.  Those little dots on the gas gauge leaves much to be desired.

We were all fairly impressed with the Civic, particularly the backseat leg room. After the 2nd test drive of the Mazda3 (auto trans this time) we made a unanimous family decision.

Looked great, ran like new.  I will agree with prior comments re: the road noise, it is a bit much on rough pavement.  On freshly paved roads, though, it's quiet as a tomb.  This has a lot to do with the Goodyear Eagle RSA tires.  When they wear out, I'll install comparable Michelins, which are quieter.","The interior & exterior appearance, fit & finish, comfort, the close tolerances of the body panels, the way the doors close with a solid, substantial 'thunk' that sounds a lot like a BMW, G35, Lexus or MBZ.

For a 2.0 L 4cyl with only a rated 139 lb-ft of torque, the pull even from low rpm in any of the first 4 gears is surprisingly strong.  Wind it out to 7-8k rpm and you feel like your driving a F1 race car!  This car is every bit as quick and much more nimble than the V6 '02 Maxima it replaced.

I use it for mostly city driving, and still get better than 31 mpg a tank, highlighted by a 38.4 tank on the highway. So far, very reliable, no surprises. It is able to accomplish all tasks I ask of it, including transporting bikes with a trunk rack. It has a very receptive pick up when necessary, but no sports sedan by any means. I like the interior styling overall, like all the storage compartments. Radio is decent, wouldn't mind a 6 cd changer instead of the single slot. For exterior styling, I'm a big fan but I think the wing spoiler is a must, keeps it from looking like grandma's car.","Gas mileage (obviously), one touch sunroof, placement of emergency brake (ya know, in case you have to use it in an emergency, not just a hidden parking brake), staggered dashboard gages. Could take or leave the digital speedometer.","Double armrest storage compartments (as in the 03-07 accords), no good place for change, I'd like a sportier cloth for the seats, current seems a bit fleece blanket."

I've owned the car for about two weeks now, but put 2,000 miles on it already.  My wife and I took it two days after buying it on our vacation from Ohio to North and South Carolina.  The performance and specifically the handling on this car are outstanding.  Snicky 6-speed manual, point and shoot steering, and good throttle response make the Si a wonderful road car.  The four door practicality means our two kids ride along in comfort too.  Just watch out for the front buckets on long trips. Ouch.","Outstanding transmission.  iVTEC whine at 6,000 RPM up to redline.  34 MPG on the highway at 70-75 MPH.  Didn't see another Fiji blue Si 4-door on the entire trip!","Just the front seats.

You have to learn a new driving skill - slow and steady vs. pushing apex turns.  Have been rewarded with combined mileage 43.8 and Highway is 55.6.  There is a lot of no a/c use to get this. Wind drag at speed over 50 mph kills mileage.  I'm staying at 58 mph on I-95 (dangerous but economical).  You need to squeeze the pedal gently and learn to coast a lot.  I have enjoyed the smooth driving style that results in top mpg.  No rushing, no frantic lane changing - slow and steady wins the race.  In this era of energy crisis I felt led to do something to do my part - Civic Hybrid is my statement.","Interior feels very open with expansive views - I like the two- tiered dash (reminds me of my departed RX-8, but not its 16 mpg).  Controls and knobs/switches better than my old Audi A6 - comparable to the Accord I traded but fresher looking.  Overall a very modern design without being Prius weird.","Sunroof and fold down rear bench are all - but I can live without both for this kind of economy.  And a better horn.

The wipers are neat too. They have air foils on them so you get a better swipe of the wipers as you are moving because it presses against the glass.  My next vehicle well be a civic si or maybe the diesel if they bring it over from Europe.,"The split dash, 5 speed tranny, all around looks, low tire pressure monitor, the engine.",The brakes could use more power and feel through the pedal to modulate better. Tougher plastics inside the door panels and the steering wheel to lessen the scratches. Maybe more features on the LX like lights on the vanity mirror and variable speed wipers. Maybe those are standard on the EX not sure.

4.875,Fun Little Car!,JJJJwill ,06/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I have had this car a couple week now and i love driving it everyday.  This is the second SI I've own and really like Honda vehicles.  The 4door sedan has enough room for my family of 4 with 2 car seats in back.  I have been getting on average about 27 MPG and that is with some hard driving every now and then.  The beauty about the car is that you can have a fuel economy car and then rev the engine a little higher and get a quick ride.  The engine sounds great when your get above 5000 rpm.  The 2 tier dash takes a little getting used to but definitely stands out from the crowd.  The premium stereo sounds pretty darn good and the interior has a nice fit and finish. Very happy with my SI.,"High revving engine, very good stereo,","a little more torque out of the engine, fog lights should be standard"

4.625,"Great car, my second Civic",Steve ,06/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"This generation Civic is the best to date. I owned a 1996 Civic for just over 12 years; I loved it before the wreck. I was just shy of 240,000 miles. My 2008 Civic is even better, more refined, comfortable, powerful and better looking. And most of all still have all the attributes that loved about my first Civic. To anyone who has driven other small cars in this class, it's the best. To those who are down grading from cars like a BMW 3 series, come on, this is a Civic and goes for 20 grand less, don't compare.","More standard power, comfortable seats (for me, 5' 8"" male), styling and sporty handling","Too much pulse and vibration in the anti-lock breaks. Poor audio, and it's not the standard head unit as much as it is the cheap speaker. Replace them with any reasonably price after market speaker.

Smooth driving and handles well.  Starts and stops smoothly.  This is my first experience with a navigation system and I really like it.  It gives concise and accurate directions and it follows my voice commands accurately.  Trunk space is considerable given the size of the car.  I traded a Chevrolet Silverado to this car, so the change was considerable, but at this time I'm thinking I may not want to own anything else.  Considerable consideration has been given to owner comfort and safety.  You cannot ask for much more than that.  ","Navigation system, Steering wheel controls.  Spacious interior.",

I was fortunate to find this hybrid on a local dealer lot and have been very happy thus far! I drive approximately 60 miles per day and this is just exactly the car I need. I have gotten 45.25 mpg and normally around 42 mpg with every tank. The extremely hot weather has drug it down a couple of mpg, but who can even complain with 40 mpg?!? (The onboard MPG gauge is always a couple of mpg less than if calculated manually.) I would DEFINITELY recommend a hybrid if you're a high-mileage driver like me!

Overall MPG average has steadily increased to 45 MPG over 8000 miles as I have learned and adjusted driving habits. Last several tanks between 48 to 50. High tank was 56 MPG!

Overall it's a great little car that's practical.  It seats my wife and I plus our two small kids well, with room to spare in tthe trunk.  I handles great especially with the summer tires.  My only couple of beefs with the car is the first 5 minutes of warm up,  It wants to buck in first or second gears until it warms up.  It just annoying, you would have thought Honda could have reprogrammed the ECM to fix this.  I've heard from other message boards this was due to something emissions rated, whatever it is very annoying. My other beef is the auto door locking function.           ","High revving motor, can drive like a bat outta hell if you want or you can save gas and drive live a normal civic.  I also like the cloth interior.  Very supportive seats up front, plenty of space in the back to haul kids to ball games, etc.  The best part is that it get close to 30 mpg on the highway.",Fix the ecm so that the rough start disappear.

Pushing it on NC 80 from I-40 to Blueridge Pkwy (posted 45 mph; most curves 15-20 mph rec) was fantastic: engine, gearbox, clutch, steering feedback, & stable seats combined for the most fun I've ever had driving a car (I'm 65).  Car has 2 personalities: economy or fun.  I don't think any other car can do both this well under $20K -- particularly with the EX's safety & Honda's reliability.  The beige/ivory color combo & sunroof mean minimal AC use.  On hwy, recirc the air, keep heat off, & turn AC on/off as needed.

5,Great all around car,Dave ,06/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Bought the EX Sedan 1 1/2 months ago and have not regretted it.  The car is very smooth and has great road handling ability.  Gas mileage is very good.  The quality of construction does not leave much if anything to be desired.  When you shut the door you can feel you are in a solid car.  Looked at the MX-3 and Corolla and the Civic won hands down.  It is a nice car to take out onto the highway and and nice to zip around town in.  The interior is roomier than expected for a small car.,Gas mileage.  Build quality.  I like the different trim levels so you don't need to go back and forth looking for the options you want they are already there.,Stereo could sound little better and a little less road noise.

The left rear tire cups or wears unevenly. Dealer said its not the cars fault. Had to replace it at 15,500 miles. I thought Honda fixed this problem already.

4.875,Excellent Choice,ZTA114 ,06/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Just purchased the civic two weeks ago, switching from a 1997 Honda Accord EX. I always found my Accord to be very reliable and well equipped, but at first  I looked at companies outside of Honda including Ford, Volvo, Toyota, Scion, and Mazda. After test-driving these other vehicles, I realized how much more quality there is in Hondas. I have enjoyed every minute of my new civic, especially the gas mileage. Being that my Accord was an older model, gas mileage was average and I can really feel the difference. Even with gas at a high, it only costs me less than $45 to fill up. Love the speedometer. It was definitely hard to get used to at first, but can't live without it now. ","Two-tier instrument panel, awesome stereo system for a stock product, AUX input, remote trunk release, high mpg for non-hybrid","Power seat at least for driver would be nice, factory tint, adjustable seat belts, lighted key ignition.

4.75,A stylish investment,gamefoo ,06/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,4,"I was considering the ever so popular Mazda3 in this class, but the 2008 Civic definitely met my expectations. Excellent performance driving for its engine power, stylish interior, one of the highest fuel economies for non-hybrids, and tons of extra features (EX model) has given me a smile every time.  My advice for those stuck deciding between a Mazda3 and a Civic: there is a performance difference that Mazda3 wins only for its V6 model.  The I4 engines for both give comparable performance but the Civic gives more MPG, legroom for rear passengers, and better quality interior.  Save the money on gas to buy a sports car later, if you are in this bracket you shouldn't compromise!","Sleek exterior, stylish HUD with blue gradient theme, excellent handling for an economy car, 26/35 MPG saves money, Honda's well-known warranty and build quality, iPod port, remote keyless entry.","Parking brake and shifter is too far forward and may be uncomfortable for some, only way to open fuel door is via lever on car floor, center armrest compartment too small."

I purchased the EXL model in dark red with tan leather. The car feels solid and looks beautiful. Our family previously owned a 2002 civic and this model is a great improvement!  The car was tuned for fuel economy and not performance, so it tends to buck a bit if I accelerate hard from a dead stop. However, I'm saving nearly $30 a week in gas, so I have no complaints.  ","The seats in the EXL are very comfortable on long road trips and have great lumbar support. The trunk is roomy and provides room to move large cargo when the backseats are folded down.  The two-tiered dash was a bit unusual at first, but I've grown to love it - especially when driving at night.","I'd like to see Honda include the 350 watt stereo or six disc cd changer in the EXL.  I wish the windows had more tinting. Living in Oklahoma, it can get up to 105 degrees in the summer. I'm going to have aftermarket tinting applied before the leather seats cook me alive!"

As sad as it is to say , you can't go wrong with a Honda or Toyota and with gas prices soaring, the Civic is much better looking than the Corolla.  Yes, they both make cars with better gas mileage, but you still have to like what you drive. That's why I chose the Civic Si.  I've only owned it for about a week, but the engineering is second to none.  Some of the interior parts are a little cheap, but what do you want for $21,500?

I have curbed my ""need for speed"" on the highway (usually travel somewhere between 62 and 68 mph - I used to drive my Audi at a steady 74 mph when I wasn't speeding)and am really into trying to get the maximum mileage.

Road noise has been reduced as well. The first thing I noticed was the performance over the 2001. It was  much livelier and with the 5 speed automatic, the engine runs considerably slower at high speeds and has plenty of passing capability. Fuel economy is great, first tank fill got me 38 mpg 20% city and 80% highway) I commute 50K a year in California so the gas mileage and comfort are a big plus for me. I would highly recommend the Civic for those folks looking for both economy and comfort.",I love the response from this 1.8 liter engine and the smooth shifting. The civic is quiet and there is plenty of storage for those small items like sun glasses etc. The trunk has ample space and the rear seat folds down for those people who like to carry a lot 'Stuff',"A little more travel for the front seats would be nice. I am 6'-1"" but not cramped. Rear of front seat pockets would help too. Other than that, nice job Honda."

I was surprised that the dealer was willing to deal on price, so we bought it.  $16,936 for the LX coupe.  I put a couple hundred miles on it, then topped off the tank for the trip from Anchorage to Fairbanks, 360 miles. Filled the tank again upon arrival, 46.28 MPG!!!

4.75,Update to earlier review,Brant ,05/31/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Now that I have owned the car for a month I wanted to add to my previous review.  Swapping out the OEM tires was a must.  Whether you have the Goodyears or the Bridgestones, both are poorly rated on Tirerack and other sites.  I had Custom Coach in Southington, CT move the drivers seat back a few inches ($350) and this has made the car much more comfortable for my 6'2"" frame though the seats are not the best.  Gas mileage is terrific at 34 to 37 mostly highway at 70-75 mph.  Car is relatively refined and fun to drive for an economy car.

My Accord had Michelin Pilots.  This car deserves better OEM tires.  Driver's seat.  I had my friend drive the car and I sat in the passenger seat and was more comfortable.

There is no noise at high speeds on the highway.  Second, the Nav and EM radio is by far the best. However, Honda needs to make the voice recognition better.  It sometimes does not execute the right command. We love the EM radio.  I don't know how I lived without it for all of these years.  The only complaint that I have is when were turned on the Air for the first Time we smelled rotten egg smell. I spoke with Honda and they said that it could be the catalytic converter.

I am a 40 yo and it makes me feel like I'm a kid inside when I drive it; yet its very practical for our family of 4. I have owned a plethora of vehicles; my 04 mustang SVT is the only vehicle I have ever had that is so much fun to drive. It makes you want to drive it; how often do you say that about a car.

4.875,Fun - Practical -  Affordable,Nando ,05/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I started looking for a EX sedan but when I saw the EXL coupe with NAV, I knew this was the fun car for me.  I've only had the vehicle for a week and I love it.  It drives like a go cart when compared to the F-150 I've driven for the past 11 years.  The Civic looks sporty, has 90 percent of the whistles and bells I enjoy in a vehicle and the price is very acceptable.  I've owned an Accord and a Pilot but the Civic wins hands down in the fun department.  Everyone should get one.","I really like the NAV system, the XM radio, the sporty looks and I'm sure I'll enjoy the heated heats this winter.  Last but not lease I love the way it drives.","A backup camera on the EXL with NAV would make backing up a lot safer and an integrated garage door opener feature like the one offered on the Pilot EXL. Bluetooth to connect my cell phone would be nice.  Honda should find a quieter tire, road noise is a bit too loud."

I test drove a Mini Cooper S, Mazdaspeed 3, VW GTi, and the Civic Si. Now i actually didn't even consider the Si in my original list but I thought I would drive it just for fun. It went from not on my list to top of my list in a matter of a hard test drive. It left me with the biggest smile, a lot of space, and the most money left in my wallet (out the door $21,800). Didn't think I would be a fan of the high revving engine but I am now. I highly recommend to take it for a test drive and make sure you open it up to get the full effect. ","The sound! The handling, grip, gearbox, clutch, interior, exterior, space, the 8k redline!",Everyone always wants more power. Oh and make sure you fully inspect your car before you take delivery. I got mine home and realized the dealer had let it go with a crack in the dash and a lot of scratches on the driver side rear door. Dealer crap aside it's a great car.

I owned TL- S, Accord, CR-V, and MDX... all of them had lumbar support in wrong position.  Even 2008 Civic sedan has weird lumbar support but Civic Coupe seats is only Honda car I don't have any problem with.  You gotta sit on one of these, you'll understand what I mean.

I previously owned a limited edition 2005 VW Jetta GLI, but due to fuel economy and no auxiliary input I got rid of it.  This civic is great.

4.375,Enjoying my cute lil Honda Civic Coupe! ,Kristen from MS ,05/05/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"I just traded my 2006 Honda Civic SI coupe in for something that was cheaper, less to insure, and something I didn't have to put premium gas in. So I decided to get a new Coupe LX civic. I got it in an automatic, I was getting a little tired of driving a stick anyways. Very nice for the price. I got mine at less than invoice price, thanks to my helpful Honda dealership. Love the tan interior, although I think it will get dirty fast. Only thing I don't like is when I put the car in park my door unlocks itself. I mean what if I was shopping and someone came up and mugged me as soon as I parked? Just don't think it's a great feature, since I would think most people who buy this car are female.","Cute sporty design, great gas mileage, hubcaps that are 16 inches, not the standard 15, clean crisp interior design.","No auto unlocking when you put the car in park, and put some little lights on the mirrors in the sun visors. Also, include fog lights, and put turn signals in the rear view mirrors. Maybe standard alloy wheels instead of hubcaps, although I am impressed with the hubs I have :) "

Rented a Prius (got 44 mpg with it) and shopped one as well - the Civic stickers for less, Honda is dealing on the sticker price, and you still get $1050 in cash back from the Feds - what's not to like? The Prius is a nice car, this is less expensive and equally as nice. I like the ""normal"" Civic look as opposed to the unique design of the Prius. The Prius has a bit more room inside, and I like the fold down back seats and rear space. The Honda can carry 850 lbs (pass + cargo) the Prius 800 lbs.","Love the blue interior in my silver, much less bland than the Prius. No Gee-Whiz gimmicks, just a straightforward mpg monitor and real gas savings. Standard radio is better than the Prius. Instrument lighting is better than the Prius as well.","A pass thru trunk back seat would be nice. Line in iPod connection for display and control thru the stereo would be nice.

5,Extended Warranty,Extended Honda Warra ,05/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Just wondering if anyone else bought the extended warranty on this vehicle-- after receiving the hard copy of this document it seems to not match what I was told it would cover--also the efforts on my part to meet the qualifications seem to be a second job on my part. I would like to hear from other Honda owners.  Thanks.,Gas mileage--37 mpg combined highway and city--tight road contact--Honda resale value--attractive body style-- beats the fit with the same mileage-- why buy a fit when with the same price you could get an attractive Civic,Like other reviews the sound system is poor to say the least--No remote  trunk release--needs a better sound system-my 10 year old van stock system beats it hands down
4.875,Awesome Car,Matt ,05/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"After months of test drives and research, the Civic is far and away better than anything else in this segment. As a commuter car, nothing beats the Civic. I don't know why some people complain about ride quality on the highway. I had to push it to 90 mph until it got a little 'choppy'. It's got to be one of the safest cars on the road with dual airbags and side curtain airbags.

My last car was a 2002 Chrysler Sebring (what a mess!!). After driving a Chrysler Sebring, I wanted a car that was dependable; especially after dealing with the transmission problems for five years.  I searched several nights on the internet about Honda products and have seen great comments about their products.  So, there I was on a Honda dealership lot and I know I have made a great choice. The only problems I have so far, is the key not having the trunk release button on it and for some reason when the windows are down, the air is not circulating properly.","Save on gas.  I filled my tank up with gas and drove 300 plus miles and the car was still on half full.

I got 28 mpg on my first tank of gas. I haven't been letting it rev high. I'm really impressed with how the car handles. The build quality is great, as Honda is known for.  I've added a few things to this Civic. I put 18"" chrome Acura TL wheels on it, HID headlights, and LED taillights. I've had a lot of vehicles. I've had BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, and Acura. With gas prices going higher, and the economy going lower, this is a wise choice if you still want fun and don't want a hybrid.",The design is great. The long doors and short windows add a sporty touch. Factory stereo is the best I've heard in a Honda! ,Put leather in it like the EX-L. It could be a little bit quieter.

We narrowed the choices to the 2008 Honda Civic and the 2009 Toyota Corolla.  It was a close competition especially since Toyota was offering 0% financing on the Corolla and Honda had no incentives on the Civic.  Contrary to the previous poster, I found the Corolla to be very refined for a compact.  The XLE model was our favorite and it does include alloy wheels, bluetooth, traction control and NAVI.  The Civic won us over with reliability (Corolla first year of new model) and fuel economy as well as engine performance.  The interior at least on the EX seemed a little more refined.","Dark seats in EX, nice royal blue color, navigation.

I tried various things to get it to stop like moving the headrests, slamming the back seat to make sure it was locked in.  Nothing worked.  I scheduled a service appt. this past Friday and was told, yes, they acknowledge the rattle and even went so far as to tell me it is coming from the seat belt tensioner, but that it cannot be fixed.  Listening to the rattle takes all the fun out of driving the car.  I want to be excited about my new car, but I can't.  We own a 2007 civic also and that is very quiet - no rattles.

The EPA lies, the manual gets 2-3 mpg more (30/35 vs 32/37) if it matters. Drove the Si w/ intent to buy it but this wonderful engine isn't special til over 6 grand up to 8500 rpm. This is not useful unless you're a wannabe racer. I'd like the power in the midrange like my Z.

5,A Blast to Drive,dustin ,03/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,For the money this is hands down the best car I could have chose. Everyone I have drove in this car has been impressed with its get up and go as well as its handling. No one can believe that it is a Civic. I wanted something that was economical but sporty. Originally I was going to purchase the coupe but after seeing the sedan I had to choose it. The sedan does not lose any performance to the coupe yet makes it easier to get things in and out of the back seat.  I am more than pleased with my choice.,The V-tec engine.,None that I can think of. To do so would simply be nitpicking.

This thing is like a whole different car than the EX. The car surges forward with throttle input where the EX has a delay and doesn't seem to have near the torque. The Si actually feels quicker than it is.  The handling difference between the Si and Ex is even more pronounced.  It sticks like glue and feels very ""planted"" throughout the corners.  I absoultely love this car and recommend anyone who is looking at an EX to at least drive one of these if your budget will allow you to take a small jump in price to be able to buy one of these.  ","Engine, 6spd tranny, handling. This is really that great of a car.  I had a 400bhp AWD eclipse for 9 years and I don't really miss it although the power was intoxicating. This Si just does everything right. I've yet to find the limits of grip yet, but only have 1k miles on it so far. ","Even more power, Vtec engagement at lower RPM. Hondata reflash fixes this, but at a cost of $600. VSA(stability control) can't be turned off with aftermarket wheels unless OEM tire pressure monitor valve stems are installed in aftermarket rims.

The build quality is top notch.  It drives very different from other cars I've owned...you must get up to about 6000 RPM to tap into the real power. But once you do, it really takes off.

It has a comfortable ride and is quiet except on highways with those ridges cut in it.  The range is a little limited with an 8 gallon fuel tank and the fuel gauge accuracy is marginal at best - an important feature when you only have 8 gallons when full. The fuel economy has been much better than indicated.  Overall average for the last 3200 miles of mixed driving has been 35.9 mpg.  It has had a reliable 200+ mile range with a 90%+ fill.  It would probably do better if the fuel gauge could be relied upon.,Gas that is only $0.90 at a number of public stations in Oklahoma.  Nice gauge layout with a great look.  Great feel when driving at highway speeds.,"Offer an optional 2nd fuel tank at a reasonable price for an increased range without having to go to an aftermarket service center.

It is much quieter in the Civic EX cabin than in the Prius or Corolla cabin.  I love the split dash display, the extra storage nooks on the dash and center console, the large windshield.  The ride is wonderfully smooth and quiet. I also love the speed-sensitive volume control. The small storage spot under the heater control was just perfect for my Sirius radio, and I love the auxiliary input below the 12-volt outlet. My only real disappointment is the low fuel efficiency.  With my Tercel, I was getting 42 mpg composite. With the Civic EX, I get only 33 mpg.","Telescoping/tilt wheel, seats, interior design, split dash display, exterior design, large windshield.","Improve fuel efficiency!

This feels like a lot of car for the money. I'm so glad I got it. I went into the process thinking the Navigation system was a waste of money, but a friend talked me into it and I'm really pleased he did.  The car is sporty but has plenty of room for a 6-footer. I've only had it a week, but I've been pleased with every aspect. Plenty of pep on the highway, fuel economy seems excellent so far, and it's a fine- looking car.

The Prius was satisfying, but the Honda was fun, and I wanted fun. Now, almost 5000 later, I am so very happy with my Honda Hybrid. I drive 82 miles roundtrip to work, 99% of which is on state highways that are over rolling hills and traversing three tiny towns. In this car, I'm getting 44 mpg and putting out very few emissions. My kids are happy and so am I.","Responsive steering, wide-spanning headlights and the mirror lights, dashboard controls with voice command, and the navigation system.

4.375,Beware of the automatic transmission,cartmaniskool ,02/28/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,4,4,4,5,"I wanted to let others know that I love everything about this car except for the automatic transmission. It shifts too harshly while in D. When driving above 25-30 mph and then slowing down or braking under 20 mph, then quickly stepping on the gas, the transmission will jerk or buck forward and you'll hear a very loud clunk sound. It is not a normal jerk at all, it is a very violent jerk and the transmission will clunk. It's pretty bad and I've learned that it's common in all 2008 civics with automatic transmissions. There was a problem with the civic si 3rd gear and there is a problem with the 2008 civic automatic transmission as well. Honda needs to issue a recall ASAP!",I love the exterior and interior styling.   The car handles like a go-kart. It's extremely fun to drive.,Issue a recall on the jerky automatic transmission.  Take the car for a test drive and see what I'm talking about. Slow down to about 7-19 mph and then very quickly hit the gas. Be prepared for a loud clunk and whiplash.

Car handles very well and is fun to drive. The clutch and close ratio gearbox are are light and easy to modulate (third gear can be a little tricky til you get used to it). Doors close with a nice solid thunk and overall the car seems well made. The only issue that I have with the car is that the heated seats are not at all what I am used to. Previous car was a 2003 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS.) My Chevy's seats got hot in seconds and stayed that way, the Honda's barely get warm on high - dealer say they are ""operating normally"".  Overall I really like the car.","Like the looks of the coupe, easy to drive and park, stickshift is light with short throws. Paint on the car is perfect!

I looked at the compact and subcompacts from Chevrolet, Scion, Toyota, Nissan, Saturn, Pontiac, Mitsubishi, Suzuki, Mazda, Hyundai and Kia.  The best compliment I can give the car is that I would've still bought for myself even if I didn't have a child approaching driving age. I really love driving it on my work commute. It really is a great car that is a much better value than the ones I listed above. Plus, it will be a dependable and safe ""starter"" car for my kid in a few years.","Quiet, comfortable ride.

I am a 19 year old, full time worker and college student, so this was a big choice for me to make, but I'm glad I did. Little bit of a blind spot which I knew about before I made the purchase (it's not that bad). People are so impressed with the interior from the gauges all the way to the space and comfort. I have no regrets. I always look at my car and smile, it really is a perfect car for me. ","Exterior is unique, the black color I chose has little tiny blue sparkles in the sun, it looks amazing.

4.875,Premium experience,Kolstad1 ,02/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Looking at the most fuel-efficient choices out there, I naturally settled on the Prius and Civic Hybrid (and held onto a secret wish for a Mazda 3 hatchback that could get 40 on the highway).  The Prius had an appealing zen-like quality to it, but it just wasn't comfortable for someone my size (6'3"").  Acknowledging my natural Hondaphile leanings, I drove the HCH (with some reservations over the supposedly ""underwhelming"" performance).  After that, it was a no-brainer.  It accelerates more than well, never once leaving me with that sinking, sluggish feeling.  Add to that comfortable seats and billet-like build quality, and I feel I got a premium-class car with 45 mpg for $21.5K.  Very happy.","Performance (acceleration & steering), tight handling, very solid & quiet structure, comfortable & ADJUSTABLE seats (unlike Prius), $1050 tax credit, the satisfaction that you're acknowledging the kind of driving you really do, not the kind you want to do.

I compared it to the Mazda Speed 3 and a Subaru WRX. The engine revs very smoothly in this car but the power when it reached 6,000 rpms is really amazing. The shifter on the Si is buttery smooth. It drives very well even in the snow. I put Nokian tires on it for winter and it goes just great in snow. My wife really likes driving this car so with all that we bought it.",I like the smooth shifter the most it's really nice even in sub zero temps. I also really like the digital speed at the top of the dash. The heater is very strong really can blast the heat. I like the design of the seats very comfortable for long trips over 2 hours.,"Ditch the metal shift knob, it's freezing in winter, Summer it will probably burn your hand. The rear electric defogger is very weak and doesn't seem to have much power for ice and snow. The seats attract lint something fierce.

I really liked the futuristic spaceship design on the exterior and interior. It really does stand out from the crowd and yes, you do get stares when sitting in traffic as if they're seeing a UFO. I've also noticed that this car has huge blindspots all around. Exhaust note is nice during warmer days and sounds droning during colder days even with the car fully warmed up.

The last wasn't to be but on all other counts, the Civic was the best choice out there.  It is vastly more quiet than the previous gen. and feels almost as planted as a Euro car.  Mileage is 30+ after 1500mi and should improve.  I think this is an ideal commuter car with enough creature comforts and fit/finish to compete with cars far more expensive.","The two tier dash and wheel controls for the stereo are fantastic.  Engine RPM at 65 is just over 2000, which means it's super quiet.  The PC Card is great as dealing with an iPod while driving is also unsafe.  The fwd visibility is by far this car's best trait.  It feels panoramic, open and airy.","Bluetooth integration would be great. Don't pretend that performance is awesome.

The Civic is no longer a cheap car to buy.  The final price was over 22K.  It is probably worth it though.  The coupe is fun to drive and handles the road well.  The car gets around 26 miles to the gallon so far in city driving using regular grade gas. Most of the controls are easy to use.  The steering wheel is in the way of the tachometer (located on the lower tier of the dashboard).  I don't need to see it anyway.  The only problems so far are a dashboard rattle and the driver's side door handle keeps loosening.  There is also a big blind spot in the coupe.,1.  Very smooth shifting.  2.  Good gas mileage in the city. 3.  IPOD connection.  ,Get rid of the two tier dashboard and the electronic speedometer.  The electronic speedometer is very distracting.  The driver should be able to see all dashboard indicators clearly.
4.625,Expected Better Gas Mileage,JVM ,01/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I absolutely love the way the car handles. It feels like a sports car. At first glance, I did not like the new dash, however, it really grows on you. The only item I was disappointed in was fuel mileage. I was expecting at least 30 to 31 mpg in city/highway driving, but I am only averaging 27/28 mpg. I do drive for fuel economy; so hopefully when the car is broken in more, the mileage will improve.","The feel of the car when driving, and its great looks.","An outside temp. gage, I really miss that, as well as, sunglass holder.  Oh, the power window fob is so sensitive you can't get the window down to a cracked position, it immediately goes all the way down or up, very irritating."
5,Kudos to Honda!,dhectorg ,01/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This si sedan is almost everything I hoped it would be. It's dangerously fun to drive (got pulled over day after I picked it up...be careful!). It handles better than some cars way out of it's price range. rRdes a bit stiff, but that's expected from a performance suspension. I love the exhaust note at pretty much any engine speed. It sounds menacing. But the best part about driving this car is the instant thrust and hieghtened exhaust note that you feel and hear at 6000+rpm. It's like somebody let a mad dog out. Pure adrenaline!",Sound system is the cleanest I've heard in a car at this price point. I'm averaging 26-27mpg in fairly aggressive driving. 6sp manual is silky smooth. The entire drive train in this car is what make it so special.,"Seat fabric is a pain. Everything clings to it. Although I like the styling of this car, the European Civic type-r (their version of the si) is much more aggressively styled...and it's a 5door hatch back, which is much more functional than a sedan."

I test drove many other cars in this class and most felt like they would fall apart in 2 years. The Civic feels solid but only time will tell.  The only big problem I have with this car is the road noise! I can be aweful at times! Need a premium radio just to drown out the noise! I am looking at options like dynamat and quitcar to help with the noise.  ","Fuel economy, doors that feel solid when they close, quality plastics, non- flimsy rear-view mirror, leather seats, heated side mirrors",Fix the road noise! It almost is bad enough for me to not like the car. A premium radio should be available in the non SI Civic. Smaller key fob. a light around the aux input. Can not see it at night.
5,Excellent buy,Shelly ,01/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've owned my Civic for about a month and am extremely satisfied with my purchase.

This car had everything I wanted in a smaller car.  Gas mileage is nice, performance is acceptable for what it has, braking and ride comfort is amazing for a small car.  My previous car was an AT 95 Concorde, this thing quite a change of pace from that huge car.

This car gives up very little in terms of handling and performance. I love the way the car looks and the exclusivity of owning one. I guess I am a little too old (31) for the Fast and Furious look, but everything thing added to the car has a purpose and has been engineered as such.  I imagine that this car is marketed to a select few, but I hope Honda keeps the Mugen cars coming stateside.  I also love the color.  This is the first car I have owned that is not white, silver or black.","Suspension set-up.  Handles better than my Audi A3 and it's softer over the bumpy stuff.  Who would have thought?  I also love the exhaust note, all Goldilocks.  Not to loud and not too soft...it's just right.  I also love the shift nob.  Nice touch.",I guess the only weakness is more power.  I figure any car owner will always want more power no matter how much they already have.  Just ask the guys that tune Porsches.  200 horses for a FWD car is pushing it.  I would not want more power if it disrupts the overall balance of the car.

Looked at the '08 Accord and Camery, but the milage and the EX-L/Navi option sold me on the Civic. I'm getting 28 city over first 3 fill ups. With the mileage, navi, and XM, I can't wait to take it on an extended highway trip. Drove it through an inch ice storm and 7 inch snow fall last week with no problems at all. ","Value. Mileage.

Such aggressive styling on a car this size is rare and in this case very well done. The view of the road is appreciated, but the blind spots are troubling, but I am coming from a Maxima with windows all around and if you actually look and not just rely on mirrors then its fine. I have noticed the occasional rough shift in the transmission and a little hesitation/skipping at idle, but i'm sure its nothing a quick visit to the dealer won't fix. I'm also not a big fan of the fact the rear entry effects the front seat position every time some gets in and out of the back seat.

I was just looking for good gas mileage and  good reliability.  I love driving this car and it gets good gas mileage, so hopefully the reliability will be there over time(because it's a Honda).  I'm not quite sure about the stereo built into the dash yet because if I want to upgrade to an aftermarket stereo, it will be almost impossible.  The stereo sounds fine though, so an upgrade might not be necessary.  The seats are a little uncomfortable, but they seem the same as other sporty cars - it doesn't bother me.

I prefered the Civic over the Prius because it is not quasi-futuristic like the Prius.  It has a regular key and regular displays.  Conversely the Prius display is extremely busy.  Plus going from a Jeep Wrangler to a HCH I went from 18 mpg to 43 mpg - quite a savings.  BTW -  That was my real world mpg after my first tank.","Excellent stereo with 6 speakers, great climate controls, easy to use cruise control, 4 doors because we have a three year old!","Possibly more color choices, but I love it in white.

The interior is much more comfortable than I expected and a lot bigger too. I love the fact that I can hook my iPod right into it. The exterior is just the right amount of sporty for me.

The 08 Honda Civic Hybrid is great, I decided to get the nav which is by the way a great system very easy to use and the system even understand my foreign accent (french).

Even cruising around town you hear the moan of the Farrier sounding exhaust. Some may ask if its worth the extra cost than the EX, the answer is yes. You do have to rev it to get all the HP out of it, but the car sounds like it has no problem going to 8000rpm. Even in the low rpms its peppy and pleasing. Its roomy enough to fit my 6'5"" frame.

Good mileage.,"Power driver's seat desirable, lock in place center console armrest."
4.5,Smart buy but not perfect,Kindway ,10/23/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,5,4,"This is my fourth Honda, following a '91 Civic, a '96 Accord, and an '05 CR-V. I traded in the Accord for this Civic and was a little disappointed in how ""hard"" the seats and interior space feel compared to an eleven-year- old car. I know the cars are in two different segments; still, I would've liked to discover that that decade plus brought more refinement. This Civic feels much the way my '91 Civic felt back then when it was new. Nevertheless, it is reasonably comfortable and roomy enough for a six-footer and his 5'11"" wife and their two children. The manual shifter is smooth, and the engine feels strong for a car this size. Especially pleasant is the handling; it rides more like a Jetta.","Manual transmission, great handling, great safety features, audio aux input, looks great from the rear, resale value, reliability.","Hard seats, funky headrest angle, stereo needs more bass, stereo needs to be more easily upgraded (major dash work necessary), Toyota Prius-esque interior/nose."
5,Intially Very Impressed,shaymasdaddy ,10/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Got tired of paying BMW maintenance and traded in my '01 525i for a white EX-L sedan this past weekend. I am very impressed with the build quality and the handling. The leather interior interior has a high quality feel and should last a long time. The stock stereo has a nice full sound. I did compare it to the Mazda 3 S Grand Touring Sedan and despite what the specs say, the Civic EX-L feels larger inside from a front and rear leg room perspective. I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it over the Mazda 3 and the Corolla.","Leather interior, heated seats, great audio system, superior crash test rating, and excellent resale value.",Auto-dimming mirror with compass should be standard on the EX-L sedan. 
4.875,Great!,N.A. ,10/11/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After extensive research (a must being an engineer) and looking and test driving multiple cars, I settled on this model. It gives you all the extras you want with a reasonable price. The design is amazing, and fun to drive. I owned a 99 Honda EX Coupe and it was noisy on the highway. This one, however, it was really quiet. Inside is very spacious and comfortable.  Would definitely recommend. ",Two tier system. Radio. Controls. Outside design. Cup holders. Ability to switch between MPH to KPH easily. Seats. Airbags and ABS.,"Some blind spots, where you have to turn your head to see cars to your left.  the gear shift box looks cheap. Glove compartment could use more space. "
5,Great Car!,Michelle ,10/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is a great value for the price. Drives smooth, great gas mileage, sleek design and interior, great turning radius. ",Digital speedometer,
5,Exceeded All My Expectations!,Dave ,10/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was ready to buy something in the $30K+ range, when both of my parents bought new 2007 Civic 4 doors. After driving theirs, I was very impressed and decided the car to get for overall reliability and gas mileage was the Civic. I waited for the 2008 version with the leather and decided to get the coupe for the better stereo system.  I have had this car for one week now, and I absolutely love it! The car drives smoothly, accelerates quickly, and looks great outside and inside (Silver with black leather). I find myself going for drives at night just to sit in the car and drive it. The car feels solid and able on the road.  It has exceeded my expectations for a car in this price range.","I like the stereo with the standard subwoofer and the steering wheel controls. I also like the sunroof, the heated coupe seats and the way the controls light-up at night. The car feels smooth and solid when driving. The brakes are smooth and work well. The whole driving experience is great!","It's not a problem, but I think lumbar support would be nice.  The MP3 connector could be moved to the center console between the seats with the second power outlet. Also, my iPod does not sound as good as a CD when connected to the stereo, but this could be a setting I need to change on the iPod."
5,Great car,CarlM ,10/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had my Civic for a week and love it as a replacement for my 2002 Civic. Changes in the six years are all good, and I love the digital dash! Seats are comfortable for 6-1 big guy. I wouldn't own another car from the ""Big Three"" Detroit auto makers.  Door locks for passenger need to automatically unlock when handle is pulled from the inside.",Handling is great. Love the digital dash and keyless entry.  Telescoping steering is great!,Trunk should pop up more without being lifted.  Find a better place for emergency brake.  My knee ends up on top of it.
5,"Wow, more bang for my buck",onebigkid50 ,10/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The Civic rides so smooth and is such a pleasure to drive. Feels like you are floating and for a car at this price range I was impressed and would have expected to pay a lot more for everything that was included. All the safety features were icing on the cake!,The smooth control and sensation while driving. The GPS system is easy to learn and what can I say about having my XM account now in my car as well as at my desk. Fuel ecomomy is great especially at today's gas prices.,Displays are cool and easy on the eyes but the placement is a little off for me.
5,Amazing ride!,Deltaflaze ,09/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have loved every moment of driving this car. I've only had it for a few days or so and it's been an amazing experience. I'm a college student who commutes and works at a hospital and it's been amazing. No problems yet and I don't expect any with a Honda. ,The display for the MPH is amazing along with the tachometer. The seat moves up and down and the little compartments to hold everything are so helpful. Aux port is nice for my iPod and the seat moves up and down with a pump lever to adjust height which is nice. Plenty of space in back. Trunk is huge,"The blind spots are a little iffy but mine's a coupe and there are no back windows, so it's perfectly understandable. They try to help you out by putting in side-mirrors that are really zoomed out so you can see the next lanes and it fixes the issue."
4.75,"So far, so good",cwhyte ,09/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"First year with leather in a Civic and I jumped at it.  Actually, I wanted an inexpensive car with good mileage, but nice enough that I would be satisfied with driving it 85 miles daily. I've only had it a week, but it has been fun and comfortable to drive and my first tank of gas got 34mpg!","Gas mileage, interior layout (2 tiered dash), fun to drive (good handling, tight steering), low maintenance, and hopefully lives up to the Civic reputation for durability.",Move emergency brake location away from right knee and less slope in the dash for easier reach to some controls.
2.5,Accident waiting to happen,Kate ,09/18/2007,,,1,1,1,5,,4,2,5,1,"Very disappointed in Honda. The Civic design makes it impossible to actually see the hood of the car while driving and this is even with the seat raised so much your head nearly hits the roof of the car. Honda says it's aerodynamic but I think it is inconvenient, makes parking very difficult and really unsafe. Honda says you will learn to sense the end of the car but I say RUN! ",navigation,Interior looks cheap and visibility is awful. 
4.875,2008 Honda Civic EX,BT ,09/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,Fun car to drive. Easy to handle. Good vision. Like the dash and controls. Don't know real gas mileage yet. Radio is great. Navigation is superior to add-on versions. Hits the road very well for a vehicle this size. Value for what we paid is good.,Navigation. XM radio. Ease of handling. Safety ratings. ,Should have some sort of insulation under hood. Hood should have automatic ability to stay open. First stop on transmission control should be D not D3.
