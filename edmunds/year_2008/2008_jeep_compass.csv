If this vehicle costs a lot less I wouldn't be unhappy,  but it wasn't worth the money I spent.  The stabilization in both front axles will go very easy and cost a lot to repair  as well as the throttle body ( this is a common problem in Nearly  all of these models ). I hear the the updated models have been improved ( I'll believe it when I see it). Other than that if you can tolerate the little maintenance  here and there ,  you should be good to go otherwise I'll spend my money elsewhere !",,

Overheated and blew thermostat, leaking anti freeze liquid, with only $75000.00 , this was covered under warranty. Does not hold its value at all.

No interesting options (i.e. USB connections etc nothing)  Though the car has only 4 cylinders it consumes way more than the design info states. The fact that for this price it 4 wheel drive is not standard is shocking especially when compared to others like the Grand Vitara (for 2 k more than the compass) or the Tuscon (or less or the same price as the compass),The only thing we really liked about it was its cool and slick appearance. Apart from that this car has nothing to offer. ,"The interior when compared to theirs in the same price range (i.e. the Tuscon or the Grand Vitara -2kmore-) is absolutely shocking.

Sticked for about 22,500, but jeep gave me 2,500 back, a generous trade and I under 5% financing, so...  So far, very good. Good pep with a 5 speed manual and good gas mileage (24- 28 is pretty accurate). GREAT Boston Acoustics sound system (I have the 9 speaker system including flip down tailgate speakers). Interior look average, exterior look pretty sharp. Handles and drives very well. Good roomy interior (compared to my small sedan, so...)  Drawbacks: cheap looking dash, but simple and logical; no MP3 jack on the 6 CD changer stereo; hatchback side windows don't crack open","Stereo is very good; good gas mileage for a vehicle that doesn't feel small; Some review say this car is Ugly, but I think it looks sharp. Not a lot of gadgets you don't need. A lot of crevices and spaces to store things, including a lot of drink holders. Dealer didn't have a 4WD version...","Drawbacks: cheap looking dash, but simple and logical; no MP3 jack on the 6 CD changer stereo; hatchback side windows don't crack open; "
4.875,Love the Compass,Lea Stahr ,03/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Drove Chicago to Phoenix roundtrip, no problems. Very comfortable seats let me drive 16 hrs straight. Lots of room, good quality, just what they should have been building all these years.","seats are GREAT, lots of room,good quality, love the LIFETIME warranty",unpadded door armrests hurt elbows engine a little noisy
5,The little Jeep that could,Bill house ,02/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,A great Jeep I love the looks. Way better than the Honda CR-V that my cousin just bought. A great snow vehicle. A Compass owner for life!,"Looks, MPG, 4wd works great, the mygig is a real gem",
4.125,Love the compass,dustin woods ,02/21/2008,,,3,4,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"Really like the Compass. Very practical for children, loading groceries, and even pull a jet ski concept boat all summer to the lake behind it.  So glad that I traded my Jeep Wrangler in for the Compass.","The outside design is unique, and stands out when compared to other small SUV's",More plushness on interior design
4.875,"Fun, reliable, useful",Lea ,02/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"The seats are excellent, build quality is good, no initial problems. The lifetime warranty is drivetrain only, but for $2k I also got the bumper to bumper lifetime. Fun to drive, roomy American made. Am going back to buy another for my daughter.","Comfy seats, good mirrors, good sound system, quiet interior, good quality","Padded armrests, quieter engine"
4.375,Good Value for the Price,D from Cascades ,02/11/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"I have owned the Compass for about two months and have been impressed at its performance in bad weather conditions.  We live in the Washington Cascades and this winter have had snow accumulation of 5ft on the ground.  Needless to say my driveway has been a mess a lot of the winter and the Compass has never been stuck.  I have confidence that it will plow through.  The reviews say that the Compass is not a ""true Jeep"", but my driveway is rutted and graveled and very much off road and the Compass has peformed well. (actually as well or better than my 4X4 Pickup)  Safety features are also great! My wife and son are the principal drivers and I have confidence they are protected.  ","A comfortable AWD 4x4 vehicle for a reasonable price.  The heated seats are great as is the stereo, roominess and moonroof.  I like the ""cheap interior"" of the so called expert reviewers.  It is easy to clean and is simple.  Guess I am a simple minded person!",Do something about the blind spot when looking out the rearview mirror. 
2.125,rolling foward and back,jackie hartley ,02/08/2008,,,2,4,2,1,,2,2,3,1,"my car has problems, it rolls back when on a hill, at a red light or stop sign, 10feet or more, so i have to give it the gas fast. it also roll's forward when in park and turned off, keys out, so i have to be real fast to run after it get in and put my foot on the brake. i get no help from the dealer, the car is unsafe to drive and they can't fix the problem. i was told he (the owner) quote, he just sells them he doesn't build them, end of quote.i was told to use the emergency brake all the time and be fast on the gas. thanks chrysler, i didn't buy a standard.61 years old and can run fast. ","i like the style of the car and the handles on the back doors, great over all space inside. i like the design of the back seats and how easy they fold down to make more room in the trunk.","the car has to blind spots which is the left and right posts coming down from the roof on each side of the windshield. if someone is in a crosswalk you can't see them. i hate the auto/stick, i don't see any need for it, and when you would have to use it, please explain.

4.75,First time Jeep owner,gil ,02/03/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,It's nice to see an American car manufacturer doing what should have been standard in the industry 5 years ago. A smaller SUV with good fuel economy. Also a lifetime and I mean lifetime powertrain warranty. This vehicle rides better and drives better than my last SUV (Ford Explorer). You can tell it's a Jeep by the extra safety features like ESP and anti-roll mitigation. Everyone that likes small SUV's should buy this model. I'm 6ft and 340lbs and can put the front seats all the way to the rear and I can still sit in the rear seats with my knees barely rubbing the front seats. And I love the shoulder room.  ,"ESP, anti roll mitigation, and anti lock brakes standard",Offer the rally package in white
4.875,Good SUV,Don W ,12/17/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,We love to drive the Compass. Great use of space compared to the other SUVs we looked at. Lots of head room and rear seat room.  The speed stick on the CVT is great.  We do mix city/highway drives with no problems. The tail gate is a bite noisy in the extreme cold (-25c). ,"Lots of room, CVT, easy to drive,",Work on tail gate fit or quality.
4.625,CVT is not for lead foot drivers,james ,11/23/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,The engine & CVT is set for max engine performance not gas guzzling. Applying gradual pressure to electronic speed control pedal will give you the best acceleration. From take-offs and passing you will notice a difference. And for added speed try running RPMs up and then back off a little on ESCP. This is an analog input devise with no direct connection to throtle valves. Work with on board computer not against it. ,"Handling, turning radius, engine & trans-axle braking when set in low on slippery hill decents. sunroof, head and leg room, heated seats, standard stereo with big door speaker for resonable bass sound, panic brake assist, ETC, 4 wheel disc brakes","door arm rest padding, eliminate small squeak of cold brakes when backing up."
3.75,"20MPG, GPS, bluetooth, Comfort",GreenCOMPASS ,10/18/2007,,,4,4,3,5,,2,5,3,4,"Quiet ride, GPS easy to use, Gas sticks around 20mpg due to it seems to have to hit 5rpm or higher to shift.4x4 is actually AWD and only 4wd low. seats lay almost flat backwards for naps, very comfortable for a Jeep. Very quiet on the highway and nice ride. Handsfree bluetooth will take over your phone call when you start the truck, nice safety feature, the caller can even hear you clearly and the people in the back seat too! GPS is fairly easy to use, but the huge sound system is not as good as the base model radio due to a 3 band EQ with no sub adjustment.  in the 4 fillups I've had max I've driven is 250 miles on 13 gallons, been worse ever since.","Bluetooth handsfree is best feature, comfort and adjustability of seats is great!  Lots of compartments for a pack rat, and great heated seats to prank your passengers with (get very hot) I'm a big guy 6'3 310 and I fit in this truck fairly easy with my long legs and 42"" waist..not a small vehicle!","Better transmission, has to almost redline to shift if not using the manual static shifter.  Auto off lights would be nice, has auto running lights, but a switch for the regular ones. Higher cup holders, I have to set up an expedition into a cavern to find a drink. More manly horn! factory autostart"
