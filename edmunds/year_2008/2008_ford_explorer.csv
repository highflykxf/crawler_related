Lot of room for the whole family and very comfortable seating.It drives very quite but reaching 70 miles per hours a front road noise surprised me. I have to check with the dealer. My experience with cars is telling me that something has to do with the ball bearings. Also a squeaky noise came from the front of the car. I checked under the hood and looks like the serpentine belt is the problem and since many people already are talking about it in the internet, I do not have doubt that that it is the problem. I will bring the car to the dealer to be checked but if those two problems can be fixed t","Room, Power, Comfort, Blue tooth, GPS",Gas miles without sacrificing power.

4.875,The Best SUV You Can Buy,Mike ,08/17/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've owned Explorers since they were introduced and have owned several. I have used them for business. They are, absolutely, the best, most dependable vehicle I have ever owned. New or previously owned. I still have the first one I bought. It has almost 290k in mileage on it. Other than standard maintanence, oil changes, tires, brakes, scheduled maintenance, etc. I have never had not one single problem with this vehicle. Not one. I just purchased a very low mileage 2008 limited. And it's like coming home again. Only better. The one that I have is a 99' and it's like the every ready bunny. It just keeps going and I love the new one. These are really fantastic SUV's. ",The Explorers that I've had have varied in model. XLT's to EB's to the Limited. (5 In all) I have felt SAFE in all of them. The best so far is the Limited. Good luck finding one that someone wants to give up.  If you're looking for a really good Family SUV the Explorer is one to look at. ,It's an SUV on a truck platform. Perfect for me. I'm eager to see the 2011.
4.25,Great SUV,SUVLover ,07/20/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,2,5,"Overall, a very good SUV.  Great power/performance, very good towing capacity/capability, lots of interior room, 3rd row seating that actually can fit 2 smaller adults, nice styling.  4WD cuts in flawlessly when needed.   Seats are comfortable but not as much as others I've driven.   Bad blind spot in the passenger rear corner but can be compensated for by adjusting the side view mirror.

Sometimes when I am at 70mph or higher it jerks also. I talk to ford about it and they said that the software in the transmission needs to be re-programmed. I have a 3 yr warranty, but it is still very inconvenient to have to already take the suv back to get something fixed and I just bought it. After reading the reviews and hearing about all the radiator problems, I guess I better prepare myself for this pretty soon. Ford should be more wise on the certain parts they put on vehicles, because when you have so many other people with similar problems, that's a big problem!!",The chrome on the door handle and shift gear.

The 96 got 22 mpg highway, 08 lucky to get 20 mpg.  The seat/steering is difficult to get in a comfortable position, steering lever knob way down under, tough to find and tougher to set in an exact position.  Turn signal lever is high behind the steering wheel, fumble to find it.  Idiot light for battery, reset button for mileage, etc is in indiotic position on dash, diappointed obviously with interior design of dash, etc.  The '96 egronomically, was much more user friendly.  '08 ride is nicer and traction control helpful in winter conditions.  ","Headlamps great improvement over the '96.  Tiny console does not hold much, no place for change or small items you don't want to lose in the bottom of the console. Cup holders on the back end of the console can be a nuisance to driver/passenger.

1,Ford Explorer - poor design and quality,TKenn ,12/08/2009,,,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,"1. Roll-over alarm goes off at 20 mph on straight road. Dealership said it was a ""short"" in the system. 2. Both Vanity Mirror covers broke off allowing the light to stay on and drain battery. Dealership replaced with visors having cuts in the fabric. 3. Tail light assembly missing both attaching screws. 4. Eyelash (decorative trim at wheel area) pulling away from body. 5. Oil changed - but the oil indicator was not reset. Found out the oil indicator only tracks mileage and time - not actual oil life. Second Explorer - same visor problem. Paint failure. Technicians failed to reset oil indicator.

I've had it 2 years and put on over 51,000 miles so I have spent many hours driving in this truck. The major problem with this specific model is that the floor heat on the driver's side does not push out as much heat as the passenger side. So, the passenger is roasting and the driver's feet are still frozen. With no dual zone climate control this is a problem. I took it into the dealer and they said they knew of the problem and tried to redirect the vents but were not very successful. So, if you drive it by yourself or live in a warm climate you are fine. If you drive in the cold and like to have company, this may not be the vehicle for you.",Lots of chrome! Plenty of power. ,Fix the floor heat problem! Cheap interior.

Can't say anything bad about it!","Audio system, the ride, comfortable seats and easy access to rear storage area.","Maybe make the interior a little more upscale, but then again, it is kind of used like a truck at times!"

4,Good bang for the buck.,Harry ,06/15/2009,,,3,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"This marks my third Ford Explorer. My only complaint is the center mounted shifter. The previous one (2002) had ample amounts of area for your stuff. Considering the price as compared to a Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder or other comperable vehicles the explorer was WAY WAY WAY more truck for the money. It literally cost almost 1/3 less than the two above mentioned rides. I can live with some small quirks for the money I saved.","In a word, SYNC!!!!!!",Go back to an optional column shifter. Then reduce the size of those rear head rests. 
3.75,Used 2008 explorer,Freddy  ,03/30/2009,,,4,4,3,4,,4,4,3,4,"I purchased my 2008 explorer 17 days ago. This is my 6th Explorer since 91. The 2008 model year is nicely styled, although personally I like the 05 much better - much classier look opposed to the chrome bars and round gauges.  At first I hated the center mounted shift knob but my hand rests on it when using the arm rest, so its actually comfortable.  Like others have said, interior parts are cheap.  Overall I like Explorers, but this 08 has had a number of issues. In 17 days of ownership (bought with 16,200 mi on it) a speaker died, a part in the catalytic converter system failed and needed to be replaced, and the no cap gas cap filler neck had to be replaced due to improper sealing.  ","I have never had problems with past explorers, so did I just get a bad one, or should you overlook the 08?  Favorites: Exterior styling, comfort, drivability, safety, size, height, availability of parts for when it has problems, and durability.","improve quality of interior parts, better gas mileage, re-think the no cap tanks - its cheaper to replace a gas cap then the filler neck to solve a vapor seal issue (mine was done on warranty), and improve the very large blind spots not helped with the rear seat head rests even when folded down."

The V6 is just enough for me, I mainly do city driving. I like the leather quality on the seats. It is very quiet and I love the comfort on the 2nd row.",Sync has to be the best feature on this car. It lets you control your stereo without lifting a finger. The power running boards are great.,"I think Ford needs to redesign the 3 row because there isnt that much leg room for 2 grown teenagers.

4.375,Good value for the money,Baxter ,01/07/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,2,5,"Went from an '07 4Runner to the Explorer. Really love the Sync system and the softer ride. Seems to be a really solid vehicle and very capable. ""Classy"" seems to be a word that is very appropriate for the Explorer, expecially given the re- design of the front end. Given that the V-6 gets similar mileage to the V-8, wish I would have gone with the V-8 now for the extra power. Would also suggest going with the upgraded stereo system as the standard unit is very mediocre. However, I feel the Explorer is a very good value for the money.","Sync System is awesome! Interior is very comfortable and puts you up in the air like an SUV should. Overall ride is also very good for a truck- based SUV. Really love the look of the 18"" chrome wheels. Safety features aren't sexy, but are appreciated. Did I mention how cool the Sync System is?","A better base-level stereo and a grab handle on the driver's side ""A"" pillar would be welcome improvements. The tilt wheel is just awful. Think hard about whether you can live with the awkwardness of the under-the-column lever. Larger rubber on the nice wheels would improve the looks and function."
4.5,"Nice SUV, Cheesy Interior Changes",Petersdraggon ,11/18/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"Previously owned a 2005. This one has the cheesy chromed instrument cluster/tunnel?),chromed round air vents. I liked the retangular ones better, not gimmicky, but kept with the truck-like theme and feel of the rest of the SUV. I also liked the column mounted shift lever, now in the console it takes up space; lever so huge-looks out of place and gets in the way of the controls especially when in park-that was another gimmicky move, form over function, I hate that. New door handles are bulbous. Engine roars-needs insulation but bulletproof. U-Haul still won't rent a trailer to Explorer owners, what a shame. It pulls them great. With that said, it is solid, boxed framed and spacious. Buy it!","Large storage behind 2nd row seating, towing ability, comfortable, handles better than a new Durango that I drove. I like the solid truck-like feel.","Sound insulation, more horsepower for the v6 and better fuel economy- although I realize the thing weighs 4600 pounds and it takes fuel to move that mass.

The 08 is definitely a flagship, very comfortable, some cheap shortcuts though have me disappointed. The chrome clad wheels, I didn't realized till purchased but come on Ford this are very cheesy. Each one of my previous Explorers all top of the line have had solid chrome or aluminum wheels. If I would have realized this I probably would not have bought it. Another disappointment is the cheap interior. For 42000 it should be plush. But overall the ride is great and seats comfortable, plenty of power with the V8. I like the new one more everyday.","Sync and the navigation, also being able to plug I-pod up directly is nice. Power running boards are cool. Nice power increase from the 2003 V8. ","No more wheel covers, this is cheap and I will not tell any of my friends, I have thought about buying aftermarket wheels for this reason. Ford really let me down with chrome clad wheels.  Cheap.
