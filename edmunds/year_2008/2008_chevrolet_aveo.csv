5,Happy camper !,john gomez ,08/28/2016,4,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,I purchased this car new in late 2008. It has 120k miles on it. the only problems I have had with it is the valve cover gasket likes to leak after 2-3 years and the headlights got so foggy I just replaced the assemblies with new ones. I change the gasket myself so thats really not that big an issue. Air conditioning still works great and I still get 34mpg highway. The a/c reduces power on takeoff and lowers gas mileage but thats to be expected on a baby car. I had the timing belt replaced at 80k miles along with the water pump and idler pulleys and the old belt still looked very good. I have been very happy with this car and hope to drive it well over 200k miles.,,
4,my wheels,milly ,03/26/2016,,2,4,,,,4,4,,,,Love my white Chevy Aveo that i have had for over 5 years. But was told i need a timing belt at a cost of $550 my car drives great but they were changing my oil pan gasket and noticed my belt was starting to fray. I was surprised because my car runs really good.I have 75000 miles on it. What if i wouldnt have gotten gasket changed i would never have known til it was too late. Not happy about this,,

I drive normally most of the time but I suspect some people who complain about MPG's just really drive their cars way too hard.

They DO KNOW that these seat sensors were set too high, and there is nothing they can do to fix it.

We then used it for a 32 hundred mile trip through Northern Ontario where gas prices average about $1.08 a liter.($4.18 a U S gallon). Cost us $95 to drive from South of Ottawa to Thunder Bay, a distance of over 1100 miles. Had no problems on the semi Alpine grades and never got below 4th gear.  Drove 10 hours a day and no back ache, most comfortable seats on the little car market and the air worked well but sucked power from the slightly too small engine.

4.375,I'm Happy,GJM ,05/21/2010,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,5,5,"I bought this car from a Chevy dealer in Anchorage. It had seen service as a rental with National, which is owned by GM. I got it primarily for commuting to work, save on gas, and keep miles down on my truck. I had a Metro once before and loved it. It was my parking lot command vehicle since I could always find a parking spot due to it's size. I got 37.5 mpg driving home from Anchorage to Fairbanks, and about 31 mpg around town. This is what I wanted and I am glad I bought it with a bumper to bumper warranty, at a reduced GM price provide by dealer. What is there not to like. I am wondering how it will fare during our ferocious winters up here in Alaska, but I am happy none the less. ","Plenty of room. Savings on gas, easy to keep clean, great for parking, and fun to drive. I should have done this sooner.","Radio speakers are tinny, better seats for distance driving, put the gas cap on the drivers side.

The Kumho 722's began hydroplaning in normal rain at < 30k miles, replaced with Generals, hydroplaning problem fixed, but still wants to leave road at Interstate speed. Had right headlight fail at 18 mos old - 'way too soon for something like that. Then had HVAC blower fan motor blow its resistor after only 7 mos on road, and again at 18 mos on road, before they figured out that the motor was the problem, not fuses and resistors.","I drive a lot, so I wanted a 'throw away' commuter car. Price, fuel economy (I avg 32 mpg) and interior ergonomics make it an ideal candidate for this.","I realize the great mileage is due to being light weight, but seriously, it shouldn't be threatening to leave the road with a mild cross-BREEZE or at 70 mph.

4,"So far, so goo.",AveoDriver ,04/12/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Overall, I love my Aveo. I keep reading negative reviews and find it very frustrating. It's an economy car, not a corvette. I'm just over 33,000 miles and have had no major problems. I changed the tires at 31,000 and leaves have got caught in a tube underneath the vehicle, creating a noise when the AC is on. The dealership cleared everything out on both occasions quickly and without cost. The interior has plenty of space and you can fit quite a bit when the seats are folded down.

3.375,1.5 year review,Matthew505 ,03/12/2010,,,4,3,4,5,,2,4,3,2,"I have had this car since 4/08. A few comments: The bad- she hates the snow here in Chicago. Handles well driving, but be prepared to shovel or use traction pads when parallel parking with over 5 inches on the ground. The smaller tires, very low power+ low to the ground= tough parking. Other issues: small tires treads will pick up every stone in the road. You will hear them when the windows are down- annoying. Good: only maintenance done outside of oil was a brake job around 14K miles. Rotors rusted. Only drive about 15 miles a day, but lots of stop and go. Overall, not a bad car. Wanted cheap car, got one that works. Bought an aftermarket radio and speakers, so all is well with the commute.","Lumbar support, Sun glass holder, easy street parking, cargo space. Decent interior.

I was shocked when I was told about the car requires a 400.00 tune-up, coolant change every 36000 miles and a new timing belt after 60000. Dealer never mention that at the time of sale!!!

3.875,Most economical car  is based on price.,Ron Wagner ,03/24/2009,,,4,4,5,4,,4,4,3,3,"We purchased this LS with air and auto for $9,340. We have been looking at Aveos since they came out. We love the way they sit. They sit high, so you don't have to fall into the seat and clamber out. The mpg is disappointing so far. Just 22 mpg city. I figure I can afford at least $10,000 worth of gasoline before I reach the price of a hybrid. I don't think that the hybrids would ever match the overall economy. We really do like this car. It could be a little wider for large people though, and I don't understand why little cars don't have arm rests for both front seats, or one that is big enough for both people. Right now, I would say go for the best priced non hybrid to save the most money. ",Price. High sitting seats. Great lumbar support. Audio input jack.,"One large, two person arm rest.

Just lock the door then hold out on the door handle when you shut-it and it'll stay locked. A little word of advice for those of you who are planning on owning for a good while. Keep the pil changed and use good quality oil.  The oil pick-up tubes in these engines are very small and will sludge-up creating a blow-by which will cause the exhaust to smoke and loss of oil, power, and potential over heating, and small engines don't like being overheated.","Power windows, power locks, ABS, cruise control, alloy wheels, 6 speaker stereo with cd and mp3, OnStar.

4.5,OK After One Year,Satisfiedowner ,01/02/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"If money were no object, some relatively minor improvments would make the Aveo a contender. So, for the price paid ($10,400 brand new off the lot!), this car was a fantastic deal. Since new, and now with 11,000 miles, only two minor problems: a tire pressure sensor went on one wheel. No biggie. This was repaired by the dealer with no issues. Developed a front-end shudder due to improper lug torque on both front wheels. Again, an easy fix. Design and build quality is excellent. Seams are even and tight. Not a squeak or rattle has developed. Motor remains perky and trouble-free (easy starts, no stalls). There is a buzz in the gas pedal over 60 mph, but have learned to deal with it.","Peppy performance (but affects economy). Classy, roomy interior. Excellent seating. Great sound system. Roomy trunk. Includes ""upscale"" features (cabin filter, oil and tire monitoring systems). Dependable to date and virtually hassle-free. Excellent warranty includes 5 years road-side maintenance.","Add convenience lighting. Move cup holders and ""air bag on"" indicator. Dull the high-beam indicator. Tighten up the manual shift (a bit loose). Tighten suspension (tends to roll in turns and high wind). A little more insulation against road noise and cure the buzz. Fix these and it's a big winner!

I got a 08 Chevy Aveo because I needed something better for my job and this car fit perfectly.

I wanted a ""no frills"" car, didn't even know if they made such a thing! When I saw the Aveo5, it was exactly what I was looking for! After the initial shock of switching from a Suburban to this car, I was in love! Drove 2,000 miles the first month just because it is so fun to drive! My monthly payment is less than the cost of one tank of gas in my Suburban! I did have a stereo installed. Couldn't deal with AM/FM...but other than that, I'm as thrilled as can be with my car.

4.875,I expected to hate it!,TEaK ,09/22/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Based on other reviews I've read, it seems to me that the people who are most dissatisfied with this car are those who expect to get a Corvette or a Cadillac for the Aveo's price. After my test drive, I was really quite impressed. It's obviously no Corvette, but it accelerates better than I expected. The engine is smooth and the 5 speed transmission is easy to drive. I am 6' tall. I have plenty of head & leg room in both the driver and passenger seats. The seats are firm, but comfortable. I've driven the Aveo for an hour on the highway several times with no comfort problems. The hatchback holds tons of stuff.

Not the most fun car I've ever bought but a great one. I needed a cheap car that got good gas mileage. I wanted a hybrid but figured that extra $8-13 grand would buy a lot of gas at $4 a gallon. I've owned this for 10 months (took in once for a sensor, fixed that day) and only have 7,500 miles. If you drive it gently (Yeh, not my style either) you'll get the estimated mileage or slightly better. I'll never call this a ""fun"" ride, but I'll always call it a smart ride. Need more fun, room, or ""style"", then spend the money. Need around 200 or-less miles a week and real economy, give an Aveo a look.","Great around town and not afraid of it on the highway.

I liked the 4 door and the price was thousands less. I got the 5 speed and wish I had the auto. I added cruise control and use the car for hiway driving. I can get 40mpg on long distances, but generally average about 36mpg. Worst thing is the sloppy shifter and hard seats.

He needs room to grow over the next 3-4 years of anticipated ownership and is supposed to end up about 6'6"" tall!  We checked out a variety of cars in the similar class, with fuel efficiency & cabin size being the #1 priorities. Not only does the Aveo offer ample headroom and decent leg space for a compact car, but it's paying for itself!  The reduced insurance cost, improved gas mileage and decent styling led us to this car.

I am 6 ft 1 in tall weigh 265 pounds and it is more room than I need. My nephew is 6 ft 5 in tall and he has no problem at all. I have 7000+ miles on my car and I love it.

I average 22.5 MPG in mostly suburban driving, with a roundtrip distance to work of 20 miles each day. I also use it to deliver papers in every morning, which takes about 30 minutes. I use to do the same routine in a Honda Civic which had a larger engine and got 30 MPG. So I am very disapointed with the fuel economy.  Even open road driving you can watch that gas gauge visibly drop. You cannot lock the driver side door except by using the key - this is a pain when you have bundles to carry and/or its raining.","Yellow exterior stands out and looks good - I wanted the copper color but they don't produce many of those so I had to settle for yellow.  I like the hatchback - plenty of head and leg room in front, although not much cargo capacity. Car drives well out on the road, but has poor control in cornering","The layout of the interior radio, ac/heater, and defrost controls is poor.

I am very disappointed. My son is 6 foot tall and even with the seat all the way back his legs are almost resting on the steering wheel. It comes with an arm rest which is so far back in the seat it barely reaches my hip and is so low that I can only rest my wrist on it if I reach behind me. As far as driving goes it is easy to drive.

Haven't owned it long enough to rate build and reliability.  For an economy car, I find the engine performance more than adequate, although not fast.  65mph comes in at just under 3000rpm.

Best small car I have owned. I think for price I paid and mileage I get this is the cheapest to own don't care how you compute it. Love this car. ","Interior room, trunk I'm disabled and my Quickie 2 wheelchair fits behind the seat and in the trunk.","Place the clock option in the radio, the clock was out of my reach from the driver seat was unable to set clock.

5,This is a great car,jason ,04/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car has been better than expected. Lots of room very nice ride and gas mileage has been outstanding the first tank we got 33.1. I have an 85 mile daily commute 75 hyw and it averages 33-37 mpg all the time and its an auto trans. Saved thousands over Toyota, Honda, and Nissan.

4.375,Great Value!,Ilkster ,04/16/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,5,5,This car is a great value for the price. It has excellent reliablity and is a great commuter car. I do a lot of driving and this car is perfect for it. It has a nice European stling and look to it. Would recommend it for someone that does alot of driving.,"The controls, body stylimg and great gas mileage",Better cup holders 
5,Best Small Car,Bob ,04/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is one fine small car. Interior comfort and quility is more than expected for a car that cost 8998 with air.The exterior is great to me.

Love this car.",Room for size feels much bigger. Handles well and looks great. Last two tanks of gas over 40 miles to a gallon. In winter was getting 34 to 38. Car is now breaking in good.,
4.25,Fun 2008 Chevy Aveo,Rich ,04/03/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,3,4,5,5,"Bought a 5 door hatch in the LS trim in March of 2008. Did lots of research on the car and found it to be as advertised. Gas mileage is roughly 30 on the highway and about 25 city. Not quite as good as I would expect in a vehicle of this size.  Aerodynamics are questionable as the vehicle is boxy and this probably leads to some loss of mileage. I took the car on a trip to a surrounding state and found that it did surprisingly well on the highways, even on a very windy day. Cruise control would be a nice addition for higway driving. The interior is surprisingly roomy and 4 people can be fairly comfortable for short hops. This is an excellent commuter car and has some nice features.","Interior room, power locks/windows, and overall quality of the build.",The engine runs at 3500 rpm in overdrive at 75mph. The engine design is questionable for high speed driving. A great commuter for town driving and highway if 30 mpg is acceptable. 
4.25,"Nice car, a few problems",Amy Voutt ,03/26/2008,,,5,5,3,3,,4,4,5,5,I love my 2008 Aveo that I purchased in aug 2007 however I have had some problems with it. Not once but twice the struts had to be changed (the same side). And just a month ago it was in the shop for 3 weeks because something happened to my transmission. Now that it is fixed and it is running okay I love it. I get great gas mileage and I love that it has 4 doors. Great for families with a 5 year old like me and still is somewhat sporty. Love the spoiler.,,
4.875,Loaded 4-Door Sedan LT Automatic Trans,Mark ,02/20/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"With negotiation, rebates and GM card earnings,paid $11,133 for all-option car listing at $17,255.  City mileage 26-30mpg;no highway trips yet. I love this little car for what we have been using it for. It is comfortable, and although not a high performer, has plenty of zip for city and highway driving. I am impressed with the build quality,'though carpeting is not dense.  Winter mats are $80 for the set, are a custom fit and have good water retention edges.  Rear seat a little tight, but rarely used. Mud flaps offer great protection. Modest steering vibration (Engine idle feedback), but no worse than Honda Civic Hybrid. Our other cars are a newer Suburban and Tahoe, Corvette and Ford GT. ","Upgraded radio/CD/sound system is great. Leatherette interior is nice;should hold up according to other reviews I've read-would prefer black to the light tan, but not offered. Steering wheel controls nice, but not lit at night. Cost/warranty was unbelievable-couldn't buy a Harley for this price!","Could use a door lock button for the automatic locks-uses door lock stem. When mounting plates, put extra raised self stick bumpers behind plates to keep from rubbing the paint. Black leatherette interior would be a nice option. Rear mud flaps need 1/16 "" nylon spacer washers to form fit to fender."
4.875,Neat Little Car,Revoc ,02/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought the Special Value package to be able to park my F150 for the daily commute (90 mi round trip).  Bought it for just under $7700 and have been very pleased with it so far.  Gas mileage averaging about 29, but that is due to either in-town driving, or 75 MPH highway, very little in between.  Can live without AC, will just drive the truck when it's too hot. No big deal on the cheapo radio, easily remedied for $150. Has a few things I wasn't expecting for such a low priced car. Serving its purpose wonderfully, and saving more than its cost in gas as compared to driving my truck!  Plus a 100,000 mile drivetrain warranty. Almost forgot how much fun a little 5 speed can be!","Price, interior room (And I'm 6'2""), fuel economy, rear defroster & wiper, Tire pressure monitoring system.  Plus it's a cute little car (Sport Red)","For the price, none!  Would like to see a little better highway mileage, but it's not that bad."
5,Great Little Car,Bob ,01/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Car is much more than expected. Must take into account cost and type of vehicle. All things considered it is a 10 in my book.Milege is better than rated 34 some city and more rural driving no highway. Have to give ten on mileage gets better than rated. Fit and trim inside and out is excellent. Better than other big name small cars I have owned. So far it is the best small car I have owned.,"Cost, mileage, apperance, overall build of car. Comfort is excellent for me. I am 6 feet 1/2 in. 260 lbs.",With all improvements come cost and I cant ask for more for the cost.
4.875,Excellent Little Car,twh7458 ,01/27/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is definately the lest expensive new car on the market I could find, and one with excellent gas mileage. This car has allowed me to justify easily the purchase of a new car for driving back anf forth to work, about 23 miles one way.  With GM's excellent warrantee, better than Honda FIT's and other similar vehicles, I don't have to worry about paying for a tow truck if it breaks down, or paying for a loaner while it sets in a garage, this is part of the warrantee.  I don't have to worry about those costly budget busting repairs to a used car, all covered under warrantee.  I enjoy the ride especially when I'm getting between 33 and 38 mpg, averaging 36 mpg! Purchased for under $10,000 !",I like the hatchback feature with the folding rear seats.  The heater puts oout hot air quickly and disperses it to the rear passenger area well.  Rear wiper and defrost standard along with front and side airbags for driver and passenger.  Gas savings the first month more than made my payment.,"The affordable SVM model which I have basically has no options.  I got to pick the color, Spicy Orange.  Have to pay more and get the LS model to get the options.  The cheap Am/FM radio is OK for cheep but it at least needs a plug jack for my ipod !  Cruise control is not available either !"
5,An unrecognized gem of a car ,Jerry ,01/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I did my research on this vehicle before I purchased, so I knew what to expect. Great value for the money. I love the car, its lots of fun to drive and I highly recommend it. In regards to fuel economy, oddly the DOT estimates rate this car as 34mpg/24mpg. I have gotten 37 mpg highway and 33 mpg in mixed driving with the 5 speed manual transmission during the winter. I expect to get even better gas mileage during the warmer months. To maximize fuel economy, I would suggest to keep the tachometer at around 1,200-1,500 rpms when shifting gears, and accelerate smoothly, no jack rabbit starts. During highway driving, try to keep the speed between 55 and 60 mph and the tach around 2500 rpms. ","Tilt steering, driver side lumbar seat support, great styling (looks like the Scion XA), tire pressure monitoring system. Comfort, handling and acceleration was fine for me. You have to pace yourself. Its not a race car! The seats were very comfortable and the car has a great solid ""large car"" feel.","I would like to have a more substantial better arm rest and cup holders. A CD player as standard equipment would have been nicer. I would have liked a fuel/oil monitoring system, and timing chain instead of belt. Would like to have even better gas mileage. Still a great deal of a car!"
5,Great car,Bob ,01/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Have owned for about a month. Am getting 35+miles to the gallon back and forth to work and around. Rural driving not city not highway. Has been super so far. Truth will be down the road. So far it has been everthing I had hoped for. Better than rated mileage I drive very conservative). Much better fit and finish interior and exterior than 2003 Corrlla that I had. Mileage is better also driving the same way. Was Ford and Toyota person. If keeps going like it is I will stay with GM.,Everything,None it seems to be everything as advertised.
4.125,"Bought the ""Ad Car"" for X-Mas",Yvan ,01/04/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,3,4,5,4,"I just bought a bare bones that was advertised on the newspaper. The offer included an extra $1K just by showing up on Dec/24th before 2pm, so I did.  It took some time and patience to make the dealer agree, after all I was taking a big deal. Bottom line, $6K + tax, fees, brand new w/ 3mi on the ODO.  My ""other"" car is an Audi S4, so for a daily commuter (100mi/day) the Aveo is impressive, gas savings are huge, build quality is better than expected, suspension is soft and body roll is moderate. Don't try to smoke anybody, unless you use your moving momentum. Brakes are quite good also. This is my 1st ""Domestic"" car and so far I'm very and impressed and pleased.","It's a manual, it's simple and not a bad or weird to look at. Suspension is soft and pot holes and bumpy roads are easy (big difference than Audi's sport susp + low profile 18""), plenty of storage and quite roomy. Heater is cappable.","Body roll, standard radio (nothing that a FM transmitter can't fix though), Seats are a bit hard and a bit high to reach extra comfortably the shifter (I'm only 5'9""), no mats?.. please (BTW, standard Wal*Mart mats work perfectly), Rear door lock by key only."
3.75,Best little car for the money bar none.,Miles ,12/28/2007,,,4,3,4,5,,3,4,3,4,"I went into my local Chevrolet dealer looking for a good used car, ended up buying the 2008 Chevy Aveo. Bottom line price. The actual mileage I get on the highway is not what was stated on the sticker, but all things considered I only have 1k miles on it. Not quite broken in yet. Best mileage 32.47. Not bad for a car I payed $7499.00. Mine is the base model. I highly recommend if you are going to commute which I drive 100 miles a day, get cruise control. I have cruise control on order and send it to chevy tomorrow to get it installed. Small on the outside large on the inside. I am a 5'11"" 240lbs. I have enough room in it. Plenty of visual all the way around the car as so I can merge easily.","Price. The driver side arm rest, clever feature for the commuter. Zippy, easy to drive and park. Fold down seats allows for more cargo room, nice. Rear window wiper blade, nice. Interior has been thought out nicely for such an inexpensive car. Very happy with it all around.",Transmission gearing. I don't think a 6th gear would work. Probably only on flat lands. Engine would be under powered for a 6th gear. The engine revs at 3k r.p.m. at 65 m.p.h. This is the reason for poor fuel economy. Daewoo/Chevrolet re-work the transmission so as to achieve better fuel economy!
5,Time to bet on the little guy,silentsam ,11/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Due to a lengthy commute, I began to look at the economy segment of the auto world. Really like the look of the redesigned Aveo sedan, so I took a test drive at the closest Chevy dealer. Wow, was I caught off guard with this little guy.  The one I drove was an 08 LT bright red, with pretty much all the bells and whistles. Leatherette interior (very nice), moonroof (power), auto trans, steering wheel controls, etc etc.  Very smooth ride with solid acceleration. Took it out on the highway, and had no problems whatsoever in keeping up.  Cabin feels very upscale and roomy. Lots to like on this one, and it has a safe feel to it.","Interior, smooth ride, steering wheel stereo controls, lots of modern features, acceleration will catch people sleeping","Cup holders seem sketchy, sun visors look and feel like they came from the dollar store (ouch, sorry Chevy)"
4.375,"We bought the ""Ad car""",mark ,09/25/2007,,,5,5,4,4,,4,5,4,4,"We bought the bare-bones ""loss leader"" car that the dealers advertise as ""2008 Aveos for $7995!"" The price was great, given that we are willing to do without A/C in an around-town car, and prefer the manual 5 speed. The promotional price was way better then the Edmunds invoice or TMV price, even after the dealer's add-on $275 ""title fees."" We also had to fight to not pay for other dealer add- ons. As expected, this car feels quite underpowered and is noisy, but overall we got more than we expected. The gas mileage is really not as great as everyone says, and is less than the old Escort we traded in. I don't know why it is low, but we can buy a lot of gas with the savings compared to a Yaris.","The interior width side-to-side, and rear leg-room. Split fold-down rear seat. Tire low-pressure warning using radio telemetry. 4 doors for this price. A tachometer. The speedometer is in front of the driver (unlike Yaris). Side airbags. ","Better miles per gallon. Turn off the ""Passenger Airbag Off"" light when driving alone. CD holder is so narrow in the back it only fits 2 CD cases. (We added our own CD/radio.) Low-frequency booming when only one window is open; like an organ pipe. Oil filter right next to hot manifold."
4.75,Fun to drive,Jon ,06/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,We loved are Aveo. Such a nice little car for the price. We drove it from Florida to Michigan and had no problems. Mileage was awesome too.,Room inside. More than the competition,Horsepower
