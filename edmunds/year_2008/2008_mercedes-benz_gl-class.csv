Towed the same trailer with a 6.2 V8 Gmc truck and it sucked. Reved it up all the time to keep pace, fuel economy was horrible. This one just sits at 2000 rpm, 3000 at worst when going o steep uphils. Fuel economy is the same as a Sequoia empty when towing, better than a sedan when empty. 1100 kms on a tank frequently (650 miles). Quality all around, comfort is supreme. Built like a tank.

In this order, left front air strut replaced, turbocharger replaced, fuel pump replaced, right front air strut and air compensator valve replaced. Both the turbo and fuel pump failures left us stranded and required towing it to the dealer. Unfortunately, we did not purchase the extended warranty as I thought that a diesel would be bulletproof. Obviously, I was very wrong.In 2015, we had to replace both rear air struts and a leaky fuel injector that was causing strong fuel odors inside and outside.And since 2015 we've been experiencing a strong exhaust smell inside the vehicle, when stopped, even when the AC recirculation switch is on. I've had the exhaust smell investigated multiple times by a local Bosch certified auto shop to no avail.My tire dealer is looking at that again today while it's up on the lift and if they don't find anything, I'll take it to the dealer next.",,

Also the park tronic went bad and had to be fixed. At 25,000 miles the rear shocks were leaking and had to be replaced. These were just the major repairs.

Although I'm at almost 28K with the original Michelin's, it is appalling that they're about gone.  It is expensive to maintain.  The 20K service is more than an S550's major service.  I checked.

4.875,Best MB Yet,Austin ,07/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The 2008 GL320 CDI is the best MB I've yet owned, out of 4 different models. It is my go-to car for all short errands and long trips. It is very comfortable, super quiet, safe, has excellent pickup (we live in the hills), has great visability and gets good mileage - averaging 20 mpg city / hwy. Also, in my mind, diesels are a better environmental solution than hybrids because of the battery production and disposal issue. Few vehicles with this weight have the same ability to pass other vehicles when you are going 40 mph or faster. We have towed horses and hardly notice the additional weight except for more downshifting and fuel consumption. ",Unexpected great feature in Texas heat is IR glass (Premium 2 Package). This feature leaves vehicle about 18 degrees cooler on entry which is huge in parking lots on 100 degree days.,Two worst features are iPod integration and navigation - both are incredibly poor and a total waste of money. 
4.875,Awesome suv,ceezeeman ,07/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a great truck.  Looks great, well built, fun to drive.  But it is an suv, not a luxury sedan and handles accordingly.","Comfort, design and build",Mirrors too small for size of vehicle.  Nice if 2nd row seats were adjustable forward and back
5,Best SUV in Canada,Marco Khan ,06/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Excellent drive and you get the feeling of a solid vehicle. Excellent interior and exterior finishing. Mercedes have thought of all the details and have done many improvements in the GL. We had two ML 320 before and now find the GL much more driver friendly.,"Suspension, electronics, and fuel economy",Can not think of any at the momment.
5,Quality is back,CBM ,06/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded my 07 GX 470 Lexus in on this and have been very happy.  I get 25 mpg,  which is not bad for a large suv.  With diesel at 4.50 a gal. it costs to fill the tank, but it is money well spent. The GL is a true pleasure to drive,  comfort and ride of a lux car.   I have pulled a large boat with out any problem.   The little V6 offers plenty of power.   It is not a corvett,  but fast enough.  ","The power hatch,  the remote windows down and up.   Well made and well thought out.","Change the location of the Cruise control,  it gets in the way of the turn signals.   Offer better packages by allowing more selection of accessories. "
5,Diesel Better than Expected,stiney9 ,06/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"First diesel I have ever driven, and I'm quite impressed with it.  Averaging about 29 mpg on the highway with 22 mpg in the city.  All that from a full size SUV!","Navigation, automatic fold down 3rd row, power tailgate, comfort, ride, pickup speed.",I would love to be able to control the rear seat entertainment from the front.  I have to pull over and scroll down the menu for movies for my kids since I can't see the screen from the front.
4.125,2008 gl450,DAWN ,05/31/2008,,,4,5,4,2,,5,5,3,5,"I am a previous LX470 owner and I have to say there really is no SUV that compares to this car for comfort and the ride and the third row seating. I can't wait to get in my car every day and drive it! Although the nav doesn't compare to Lexus ease of use and the DVD is in a weird location for usage. I also did not realize that the non-leather seats are a bit sticky in the heat due to the fact of no ac in them. The ac works great and the stereo is better than my Lexus. The windshield wiper controls are hidden and hard to see. I kept hitting the cruise control for the first month, now I am used to it. I have never had a Mercedes so all the controls take some getting used to. ","3rd row seats, power liftgate, great stereo, styling, power, and ride","I had some problems with starting the car for a few months, had to be jumped 6 times. Kids can't leave the entertainment system on or the car wont start. You have to turn it off, it doesn't turn off with the car. I had a steering wheel column module replaced because of the jump starting issues."
5,GL450,terp97 ,05/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This GL is awesome. It rides so smooth the transmission is flawless. I really do feel like I'm in a G500 jet or something. Great acceleration when needed.,"Ipod, satellite radio, DVD, nav, power 3rd row, power tailgate, 19th wheel package.","More bling factor it is just missing the one or two things from the 550. I don't want the 550 engine just the grille, fender flares, chrome rails and chrome fog lights. Better user friendly NAV system like the Acura or Lexus."
5,In love with my GL,Mb lover ,05/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We came across the Gl450 looking at the R350. My GL, which was stickered at 70,000 was equiped with pk1 package, keyless go, 2 dual DVD players, trailer hitch, ipod integration kit and 19'' inch wheel package. The GL which gets a 11,000( base price) premium over the R , it's totally beautiful in the exteror is worth it ( although interior dimensions are a bit tighter.) In love with my GL.",Everything,Keyless go is practical- but not so practical and sometimes makes you forget to lock the car.
4.625,Incredible handling,Andy ,04/29/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Wonderful ride, stability control works very well. Very sophisticated interior. The engine has a lot of torque and accelaraton is good for a family SUV. The 4matic system is very good. What else you can ask for an SUV? Although the price of the diesel is very high the mileage per gallon is good enough to make the change from gas to diesel. I hope we can see more turbo diesel engines in the future.","Stability control, transmission, 4matic, air suspension, rear camera",More horsepower for both engines (diesel & gas) also we expect to see AMG version of the GL in the future.
4.875,Love this vehicle!,summergirl ,03/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Having owned 2 different Lexus SUVs and liking them, I can honestly say that this MB GL 470 is by far the best vehicle I've owned. Just the right size for me. Not big, but roomy; not small, but manageable. It's a gorgeous vehicle, great sound system, incredible grade of leather, lacks nothing. Better on mileage than the Lexus GX I previously owned. It's solid and handsome. I travel to my son's home once a month, which is a 450 mile each way trip and I could not be more comfortable. I absolutely love this car. Cannot recommend it enough!","Aside from the obvious, which is the good looking exterior,my favorite feature is the absolute comfort inside this car and the ease of handling it. It just screams first class.","The only 2 complaints I have are; l. the CD compartment should hold multiple CD's as opposed to only one, and 2: the automatic hatch close does not always completely close. Very often the alert will sound that it is insecurely closed. I have heard other MB owners claim same."
4.375,"A gas guzzler, but oh it's so sweet!",fusiondave ,02/26/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,2,5,"Just had it for about 3 weeks now, and it's so sweet to drive!   The exterior styling is gorgeous & although it is a big car, it doesn't look like it.  Gas mileage is averaging about 15MPG, but hey, I guess I knew what I was getting into from the getgo. The V8 engine is very quiet, and it seems to be more than adequate to be able to handle the 7000lb weight without any problem.  Compared to the X5 I used to drive, it's a little mushy in handling, but it still a joy.  The 3rd row seat is great for my kids (the real reason for my purchase). The seats are comfortable all around, and there's plenty of interior space.     ",The keyless-go option is very convenient.   ,"The iPod integration feature is great, but there was absolutely no documentation on it!   The remote garage opener really should not be on the rearview mirror.  MB should follow Lexus and move it to the visor, or maybe even down to the dash board."
5,I traded an 07 Lex GX 470,Charles ,02/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded in my Lexus with only 14 K miles. I just stopped to look at the new GL class as we wanted a larger vehicle.  I am very very impresed. Don't let the low entry price of the 320 fool you, mine decked was 74 K. Was it worth it yes. I can't advise on long term reliability or build, but for 2 months my judgment indicates MB is back.  I get 26 miles to the gal. I towed my boat yesterday ( 5K lbs ) no problem.  Yes I am very happy except 1. outside mirrors too small, the cruise control is in the wrong place, add easy exit seats that more back and down ( like cad escalade )  plenty of power, 26 mpg, full time 4wd . ","The diesel motor that allows a big suv to get 25 plus mpg and have the guts to pull 7500 lbs. I have tried this and it does as it says, also you will notice no noise of a diesel motor.  I carry disposable plastic gloves in the door to avoid the diesel smell . Starts right away, no wait no smoke ","Move the cc lever . Have the seats easy exit. Add blue tooth for free( this is an 75,000.00 car. Don't tell us what the floor mats cost. You have a great vehicle on your hands, if a problem comes up, do the right thing. That way you can be proud of your product for many years"
5,The Germans have done it again,tdiesel ,01/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"It's a Mercedes and it holds up to it's name. I test drove the Range Rover, Infiniti QX56 and the Escalade. None of which come even close to comfort and performance.  I opted for the GL320 CDI, which is the turbo diesel and for an almost 3 ton truck I get between 24 and 29mpg(The Escalade gets between 12 and 18mpg). The interior design is truly stunning and it has more features than you'll ever use.  ","The performance from the turbo diesel, 398 ft-lbs of torque available at 1600rpm!",The price is the only downfall of this vehicle.  Fully loaded it was almost 70K.
5,Fun to drive,Don ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Just picked up the GL CDI last month. So far it was worth the 4+ month wait for the CDI. Great value and priced near the ML gas loaded. Just done the second tank and nearing 900 kilometers (Canada). Lots of power/torque. Great ride. We also have a SL550.....another great MB,Ease of handling and great mileage and interior ,None yet
4.875,The Best SUV I've ever owned,jluna ,12/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Leave it to MB. They hit the nail on the head with this car. I wanted the CDI, but it is not yet available in California. After having owned a Range Rover, a 4Runner and a Cayenne, I can say this is the best SUV out there. If not for the 911 Porsche, probably the best car out there.","Ride is sporty but comfortable. Interior is close to perfect. In the Capri Blue color with a tan interior, it is absolutely gorgeous.",Pricey. Also the navigation system is not so great when compared to the Lexus products. 
4.875,Excellent Car!,Mom2Boys ,11/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have had the car for about a month and could not be happier.  I have had a couple of Navigators and looked at it again before buying the GL 550 - there was no comparison. Quite simply, this is the best driving car I have ever owned or driven.",The ride is quick and smooth. It is a solid feel with superb handling. Terrific features - so many that you feel quite spoiled in this car. Can operate so many features from the steering wheel.  I love rear camera and front/rear sensors.,"As others have said, the side mirrors could be larger. They leave a blind spot.  A/C seats is one feature the Navigator has and I wish this one did as well. Otherwise, I cannot think of thing to add to this dream machine."
4.75,GL 320 vs. Buick Enclave,rrtker ,11/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I purchased an Acrtic White GL320 on 10/31/07. I love the vehicle and overall the fuel economy of the diesel is meeting my expectations. Now that I own both the MB and an '08 Enclave I can honestly say that GM has a winner on its hands. The MB certainly has some enticing things including the diesel offering, a firmer ride, etc. But dollar for dollar the Buick is pretty hard to beat. If they would simply upgrade the quality of some of their plastics and the fuel economy, I would be hard pressed to choose one over the other.","Diesel fuel economy, iPod integration, space, and comfort.  ","Add-ons are ridciculously priced. $420 for bluetooth? Its free in a Toyota, Acura, etc at half the price.  No rear A/C in a $63k truck?  "
5,In Love with my GL 320 CDI,pollyspop ,11/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Traded from a Yukon XL. I pull a 4000 lb boat and wanted to go greener. 23 mpg my first 2000 miles compared to 15 mpg with the Yukon. And all this Luxury! I bought the Premium 1 pkg, Trailer Hitch (which is very unabtrusive),19"" wheel pkg,I-Pod Plug, Side rails and chrome fog lights. Power and Acceleration are Not an issue with this vehicle. I know there will be a larger diesel engine soon...I will not need it. I find the Ultra Low Sulfur fuel everywhere.",Performance of the 320 CDI diesel compared to my Yukon XL. Load leveling pulling the boat. Large wheels and tires. The Nav system satellite radio. Folding mirrors. Electric third row seats. Electric back lift gate. Rear back up camera. Amazing off road ,Front AC plug Interferes with the cup holder. Front glove box is too narrow and small. I can't put mud flaps on with the accessory side rails.
4.875,Loving it,ADNoVa ,09/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Picked up the GL 320 about two weeks ago and couldn't be happier. Got rid of an XC 90 over size and quality issues. Compared to the GL, the XC90 feels absolutely asthmatic. Love the power and torque of the diesel.  It's a little noisy in first gear but it's no worse than the whine and groan of the Volvo. I drove every full size (not giant size) SUV and nothing in this class compares to the GL in terms of space and comfort. Getting 23 mpg blended around town is a happy bonus.  Drove the V8. Love the sound and it's faster overall, but around town with kids, not worth the fuel economy trade off.","Beautiful interior design with stitched dash and wood accents.  Comfortable seats. Real 3rd row.  Power 3rd row seats and tailgate.  Satellite radio, Nav, and Bluetooth are very cool. Combo of 7 speed transmission and diesel torque drives like silk.",Low end acceleration is great but maybe a slightly larger engine with more horsepower would be nice for higher speeds. Current engine gives up some fuel economy to cruise at 75 mph.
5,Best of both worlds,gd77 ,09/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"While we only have 1200 miles on this vehicle, the MPG has been very impressive and at no loss in pick up. Average mpg to date is just under 22 and the cruising range is great with a large tank. The CDI has a slight diesel ting to it and you can notice that this is a diesel engine but it is nothing like the competitors diesels. No smoke, no loud clanging of the engine, and it is very refined.","Navigation, seat comfort and position, refinement and quietness. Also this large vehicle handles like a car and provides a very secure environment.",I'd like to see the HomeLink buttons off of the rearview mirror. You will eventually learn to grab the mirror by both top and bottom when pressing the buttons to open the garage door but until then you'll be moving your mirror each time you open the door.
4.625,GL 550 Refined And Exilerating,Gary Case ,09/19/2007,,,4,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"This car has a duo personality, smooth and refined around town; yet exilerating on the open road. The ulta wide 21 inch tires complement the suspension dynamics to make it handle like a BMW x5 with out the punishing ride. When you are on a Sunday drive with the family, they'll never realize there is 380 horses under the hood.",I lke the styling better than any car I've ever owned with the possible exception of a 1970 mustang Mach One. It's upgraded killer sound system rivals the Mark Levinson in my 2007 Lexus LS460.  The comfort seats adjust to an ideal position for all body types. Power tailgate is great.,"Side mirrors are too small for safe driving, and completely inadequate for trailing. Navigation and convenience electronics can't compete with Lexus"
4.75,I hate getting out of it.,BlackNBlue ,09/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,I have driven this car for two weeks and I am as excited as a kid with a new bike. I find it hard to stop and get out of it. The gadget factor is huge but all useful and user friendly.,The ride quality is superb. The value is unmatched for a company that builds luxury vehicles. ,"As another reviewer noted, the options packages could be designed more favorable to the consumer. Second gear start makes it a little sluggish. The other need for this vehicle is better placement or design of the cruise control lever. It's too close to the turn signal, same issue the MB CLS has"
4.625,Vehicle for me,Darlene Taylor ,09/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,The driving experience has been wonderful. The vehicle holds to the road and basically drives itself. The sensors are an added feature that certainly gives a peace of mind related to safety. ,Rear view camera. Large screen easy to see. Clear dashboard display. Hands free telephone feature bluetooth. ,Gas mileage would be the area of concern for me that could stand improvement. 
4.875,Let It Ride,W-4-550 ,09/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a truck of excess. All options basically included and it's a pleasure to drive. Also stands out against the GL 450. So just get this truck and ""let it ride"".  ","21"" wheels. MB emblems..  ",Iprove DVD controls
4,OK vehicle but  stupid option packages,mssurrey ,08/17/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"The vehicles is similar to the ML in design, especially the interior which is an almost exact copy og the smaller ML class. The most annoying thing are the options packages (only two or three to choose from).  In order to get memory seats, I had to spend thousands of dollars on a Premium package with many features I simply didn't want or need such as a sunroof and a Nav system (have my own Garmin unit) At a time when many manufacturers are increasing options, Mercedes have bundled everything together so that the only option you now have is basically 'Take it or leave it'. How ridiculous",,Options should be individual like an 'a la carte' menu so that you can get what you want and nothing more. Bring back the lighting / comfort / and other packages at the very least. Reliability issues with electronics (this is a perennial problems with Mercs nowadays).
