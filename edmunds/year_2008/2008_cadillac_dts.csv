It rides like you're in your own living room!  When you sit inside and start it up, you think you're in a space ship...lights all around!  It's designed to work with OnStar, so we had to get an aftermarket bluetooth adapter.  The navigation is CD (DVD?) driven, so future updates should not be a problem.  I LOVE the dual heated and cooled front seats, and the rear seats also have heat!",,
3.875,Wanted to love it...but in the end...didnt!,phillip_g ,03/13/2015,,,5,5,3,3,,4,5,3,3,"I have loved Cadillacs since I was 5 years old and rode with my Granny everywhere in her many Cadillacs over the years.  I am not the typical age of the traditional Caddy buyer.   I like the size, comfort, and style of large American Cars.  Family has always driven Caddys or Lincolns and I carry on that tradition with a great amount of pride.  Purchased Certified-Used in early 2011, traded a 2005 Deville DTS that I loved. The 2008 DTS is NOT a sports car nor is it intended to be. I am so very disappointed in its reliability issues not only for the cost but also for sentimental reasons.","Heated and cooled front seats, front seats have rolling lumbar supports. Rear seats are heated and has HVAC controls for the rear passengers. Its difficult to be uncomfortable in any seat in the car. As the driver you can personalize almost every feature to your individual setting and works with key fob or memory button. Very Comfortable for 5 adults, great road trip car. HUGE trunk. Front and rear parking sensors are handy. Smooth V8 and considering its size got decent mpg.","Difficult to park due to the turing radius. A vehicle of this size should not be front wheel drive and transmission was only a 4 speed thus hindering the performance of the big V8.  It was just out of warranty  and it started to have major issues- rear suspension problems, cracked motor mounts, and leaking a lot of oil into the crank case- needed almost $6k+ worth of work after putting $2500 into the front suspension. These issues were very surprising to me as I am neurotic about taking care of my vehicles and maintenance on them.  2005 model had almost the the same exact issues but were covered under warranty.

3.75,Glad I didn't sell my Merc Grand Marquis,rdownie ,03/31/2014,,,4,5,4,4,,4,3,4,2,"I recently purchased a 2008 Cadillac DTS with 62,000 miles. It was to replace my 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis with 155,000 miles.The Cad looks and runs like a brand new car, but the ride is not near as nice as my aging Grand Marquis.Lots of road noise.Every bump in the city streets are accented by thumping noises as the wheels go over the spots.I took it to the Cad dealer and they claim that is the way all Cadillac's drive these days.Plus they charged me $1600.00 to replace both front sway bars and a left front drum.Luckily they split the cost with me since I had only owned the car for 31 days. Plus, too many buttons to push---very distracting. I should have bought another Merc.",Love the looks and the moon roof.,"This car has the console with the shift lever.
Nice, but would like to see the D, N, R, etc back lighted at night.
Also, the dash is nearly unreadable during daylight hours.
The biggest problem is with the road noise.
The car rides like a dream on blacktop freeways but like a noisy sports car on city streets.
This is my second Cadillac and it will be my last.
The prices keeps going up and the quality keeps going down."

The 2008 is the first caddy I brought brand new and I have to say the even though I think the car looks good, the ride is just not there. I really miss my 97 deville concours and wished I never upgraded.",I real enjoy the heated and cooled seats/ heated steering wheel and the look of the car.,"Engine a little loud....

My old DHS was a great car with a bad transmission.  I had a few problems and tried to contact the ""help"" line.  They refused to let me talk to a decision maker and were basically worthless.  Cadillac apparently does not want to talk to customers.  I am trying to go through the dealership and they will not give me the name of the GM Rep so I am not allowed to talk to her.  This is unfortunate since I have 3 GM cars and when these are gone will likely not have another.  ","The DTS is a solid car, very nice on the road, comfortable seats with the lumbar, nice acceleration, and a nice looking car.  ","The transmission ""clunks"", very noticeably, and GM refuses to fix it or even acknowledge it is a problem.  The bulletin (given by the dealer) says the clunk is normal and discusses a thrust reversal on shift.  This car does it when the gas is slightly pressed.  GM's response is not good.  "
4.75,Fuel Economy lacking,chuck ,12/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I have had several Cadillacs including a 2006 DTS that got good to excellent gas mileage.I use the DTS primarily as a short to long trip car,so it's mostly highway driving.Still the mileage as recorded by the computer fuel monitor is in the low 20's, where the 2006  was in the mid 20's.

4.75,Great purchase.,myeaglelimo ,08/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I purchased this vehicle a year ago.  I run a limousine company, American Eagle Limousine, and the Cadillac DTS is the customers vehicle of choice.  It surpasses the Lincoln Town Car in exterior design.  My client are always complimenting on how ""smooth"" and ""bump free"" the ride was.  The car is a head turner and has been extremely reliable.  I purchased this vehicle at 7,500 miles and it has well over 100k on it as of August 2009.  I have not experienced any engine problems.  The only problem I experienced is with the rear cup holder, which has cheap build quality.  Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase. I will be purchasing more Cadillacs in the future.",The parking sensors help me park this relatively long vehicle in tight New York parking spots with ease.,Better build on glove department and rear cupholders.

4.625,Our 2008 DTS,L. Tong ,12/11/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"We owned our third Cadillac on August 31, 2008. Overall the 2008 DTS is comfortable and the engine has a lot of get up ond go. However, 2008 DTS appears to be noiser than my previous 2002 Deville. From the front of the vehicle gear noise can be heard between 25-30mph. release the accelerator and the noise is gone. Below 25 or above 30 mph the gear noise cannot be heard. Suspect the transaxel. The side seat buckles in the back seat are set down too far making it difficult or next impossible for an average size adult to connect the latch to the buckle. Question, have the car companies stopped using undercoat on vehicles?","Love the color, Black Cherry and the tan leather interior seats. It's handy to have the controls on the steering wheel. ",Extend the back seat buckles about 4 inches. I hope that the dealer can eliminate the gear noise. 
4.75,What a Cadillac is supposed to be!,Southern ,11/30/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Big, strong and comfortable. Quiet. Economical - using regular gas, long oil intervals and all this with a torquey V8. Really well thought out. No ""Idrive"" or other difficult to understand user interfaces like the competition offers. Has all the toots and whistles including power lumbar with massage! Side radar that warns if something is in the blind zone. Rear and front parking aids. And a bunch more. Needless to say it is very comparable to more expensive foreign cars, but does some things better.  This car just makes you feel good when you drive it.  ","I like the size. No, it's not as large as the older models, so it is easier to drive/park, but it is still large enough to have lots of room. Rear seat passengers feel like they are in a limo! Top of the line glass adds to the quiet ride. The V8 has torque that V6s can only dream of! ",I would like to have a bit better high speed cornering if I could get it with no sacrifice in ride. Maybe the magnetic shocks from the performance model? And the next interior could borrow heavily from the looks of the CTS interior.. with better materials befitting this top of the line luxury sedan!
4.875,American Beauty,TomK ,11/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is the most beautiful auto I have ever seen. Everything about its styling pleases my eyes. There is no defect in appearance inside or out. If I had a blank piece of paper, this is what I would design. Several years ago I attended a comparison drive of luxury autos sponsored by Motor Trend Magazine. I was able to test drive the best of Europe, Asia and the US any way I wanted. Believe me, no expensive import offers anything more than the Cadillac DTS except snob appeal. I had really planned to buy a six cylinder with a six speed transmission. But when I saw this DTS, I couldn't say no.","Beauty (Styling with White Diamond paint), comfort and safety. Easy to drive and handle. Large rearview mirrors with front and rear park assist. Easy to live with roof line (don't hit head getting in and out) and trunk access.","I would prefer better gas mileage and less exhaust noise. Add option of 6 cylinder and 6 speed transmission like CTS for at least 2 mpg. Add Heads-up speed display as standard. Add brighter dash lights with manual control. But most of all, significantly reduce exhaust noise. "
4.375,American luxury,Don ,10/22/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,4,4,"Great car.  Handles better than the '05 Deville I traded.  Smooth power from the V-8 with decent mileage for the size of the car.  I get 26 mpg on the Hwy. Comfortable and quiet ride in American luxury tradition, yet still decent handling.  Good value for the money. ","Large, well appointed interior. Comfortable seats. Excellent rear seat leg room. Huge trunk. Easy to use stereo. ","Higher quality leather. Bigger numbers and letters on controls and instrument panel (remember the demographics).

5,American Luxury Car,Ralph ,06/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded a BMW 745 for a Cadillac DTS. The Cadillac lacks some of the more sophisticated technology of the BMW but it is easier to maintain, it rides beautifully, and is easy to get serviced. Consumer Reports recommended this car for reliability in part because it dispenses with some of the cutting edge technology and, instead, provides reliability and a more affordable price.  The large trunk and back seat and good for carrying more passengers and luggage. We use this car as a road car for longer trips. It takes regular gas, parts are easy to get and there is an extensive dealer network. GM has done an excellent job with this car."," Comfortable ride; spacious trunk and large back seat. It takes regular gas, goes 15,000 miles or so between oil changes and easy to use controls. The exterior design is aesthetically pleasing and the quality of the product has been excellent. 10,000 miles in six months and no problems at all.","A sunshade for the rear window would be useful and an outlet in the trunk for a cooler would be a good option. Also, had a hybrid been available, I would have considered that to improve gas mileage (about 25 on road trips)."
