Then after a mile or so, I realized this was a very special truck. It drives like a sports car and truly tugs at your soul when it hits you with that attractive engine note.

Has a plenty of power for a pretty large SUV, yet also gets around 19mpg if driven for optimal fuel economy. Drives perfectly smooth and handles really well for an SUV, the only thing is that the sway bars are VERY stiff, so going over a speed bump at an angle is going to shake you pretty bad. Handles well off road, can hold its own just fine even with 2wd.

2.125,Do not buy this to tow anything,john davis ,08/27/2010,,,3,3,2,1,,1,3,2,2,I purchased 2008 SUV 2 weeks ago. I read reviews. GM's claims were that this car would tow 5200 lbs and up depending on rear end. My boat and trailer weigh 3600. Now to tow on flat interstate highway it will not tow in fourth at all at speed limit without dropping to 3rd gear and 2nd gear on an incline. We contacted gm. They said there was nothing wrong and to tow in third gear 1300 miles to Florida down and 1300 back even though 2 states are mountain states and it would be in 2nd gear at least 1/2 of the time. This is very hard on whole drive train and would diminish the life of vehicle. Their 4.2 6 cyl. is rated at 291 hp at 6500 rpm but max rpm is 4500 how can you research like that just sick,SUV seems ok but to not tow causes us a great financial burden,GM and dealers should disclose vehicle performance honestly so a person could research in confidence and trust
4.125,Nice car at a good deal,Meyers ,07/15/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,4,4,"I bought my Trailblazer mostly for towing my toys around.  It does this very well. It doesn't get much mileage as I have 2 beater cars that I drive on a daily basis.  I get anywhere from 15 to 17 MPG in the city and around 21 on open highways.  I have been a Ford guy through and through, but when it came to this purchase, I couldn't pass it up. For the price and features, it beat all Explorers that I looked at.  Don't get me wrong, if I were buying brand new, it would be Ford all day, just on principle, but I was looking at getting the biggest bang for my buck on this purchase.","Towing capacity, passenger and cargo space, nice additional gauges that you don't see on most vehicles at this level",My biggest complaint would have to be the 4 speed transmission.

We have tried high performance oil, but that didn't seem to help much. I enjoy the smooth ride and the power of the engine but it sucks both the oil and your wallet dry! We bought it with 17 mpg in town advertised BUT I have never gotten anywhere close, so we feel like we were ripped off. I have only put 10,000 miles on it and drive average.

I test drove a new Equinox last week and was VERY unhappy with it. The vehicle had no power (even with the V6) and the gas mileage was a far cry from what they had claimed. I have had an 04 Trailblazer which was just traded in on a 2010 Acadia and I still have my 2008 Trailblazer. Just can't part with her.

This car drives like a dream with tight ride, a little softer than a Mercedes. I managed to get this car with the 5.3 engine and I am very impressed with the performance and I have no problems merging into busy Dallas traffic. The turning radius is amazing and can easily manage any U-turn or parking lot space. I know the the fuel economy could be better but I can't complain because I knew that when I bought the vehicle. ",The handling and ride. The overall appearance.,"I would love to see a diesel, flex fuel or hybrid option"
5,Still great,darren ,08/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great power, ride, fuel economy better than expected, all the safety features, the quality is awsome! Better than any Toyota I've ever owned. Will buy my wife an 09",,
4.375,Big Fun With a Price,drwooly ,07/02/2008,,,5,3,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"Now, on 07-01-08, kind of an update, because I've always felt like initial purchase is like lust, but keeping for a while is long-term love. MPG has leveled at 15 town/road, and drops to 11 if towing.Where's the six-speed A/T? Ride has degraded some because of low- profile tires, but still fun. Obviously, GM engineers don't expect anyone w/ this vehicle to tow anything because of the brain-dead design for electrical connections is impossible to use w/o altering /cutting some plastic. Just for fun, entered a car show we were playing music for, and walked away with a Top 25 medal for newer models. Didn't expect that! Still fun, still drinks gas like Foster Brooks, very nice!",Corvette soul in an SUV body,None to make; they're discontinuing ths vehicle. How much would a 6spd.A/T cost to swap?
4.75,Love My Trailblazer,Red1 ,06/20/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded my '05 Equinox for my '08 Trailblazer. It has great pick up and a very comfortable ride.I like the interior styling. The controls are all easy to use. The steering wheel controls were a little confusing at first but I got the hang of it. My 3LT has a lot of nice features, sunroof, Bose Radio w/6 cd changer, blk leather seats with warmers (needed for Chicago winters), recall seating using key remotes. The list goes on. Gas mileage same as Equinox more or less. Right now I am averaging 17.3 in the city (must be the lack of summer traffic).","Comfortable ride and seats, Bose radio, interior controls easy to use.",Gas mileage could always be better but much better than other makes of similar size.
4.875,High-Tech ... But Still Some 'Retro'!,tknrg ,05/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The ""TBSS Experience"" is as close as you're going to come today to getting a true sense of the good old glory days of the historic ""Chevy SS"" muscle cars of the '60s and early '70s!  This vehicle not only recreates the feeling of the ""SS power cruisers"" of the past -  - but it has handling, ride, comfort, and convenience features that go well beyond most vehicles (car, SUV, or truck) on the road today, especially in its price-range.  This is an all- around, truly fine, American-made, limited production vehicle!  Pretty spectacular all-around!","This is as close to a ""perfect package"" as one can find. Top-shelf throughout!","Dual exhausts would have looked better , and, in Florida, the window tinting might have been a little darker."
4.25,2nd TrailBlazer,chevy buyer ,05/11/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,3,5,"This is my second TrailBlazer to purchase. The first one I had for four years with vitually no mechanical problems. I love the 2008 and the cosmetic changes to the front and rear end and the wheels! Great black leather interior, sun roof and 6 disc cd.  It is really fun to drive and looks good. OnStar is a nice security feature too",,Some wind noise from windows
4.125,Nice SUV, Joe ,05/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,2,3,"We traded in a 2005 Saturn Vue because of our growing family. It is more comfortable, quieter, than the Vue. The Vue was much faster due to the Honda V6 that it had, and it was better on gas. For being rwd, the TrailBlazer did great in the snowy season we had in Detroit Michigan. We never got stuck, or slid off the road. We average 15mpg in the city, and 20mpg on the high way.","The sunroof, stability track, and traction control. It is also very comfortable.","Gas mileage, and wind noise on the high way."
4.875,A Wonderful Blend,tjl ,05/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My 2008 TrailBlazer SS AWD is the first performance truck I have owned. In the past I have had BMWs. Z Cars, etc. as my performance rides and a Blazer as my truck. I read a lot of reviews and on-line postings about the TB SS. I took one for an extended test drive and I was hooked. No car I have ever seen does everything well. The truly great cars are a balance of features and the Trailblazer SS is a great ride. Chevy has not just jammed a Corvette engine in a SUV. They have paid attention to all the details such as handling, comfort, looks, build quality, and did I say performance?  They have tweaked everything. You will forget that you are in an SUV.  The SS is a true joy to drive. ","The SS not only goes fast, but it handles like its Corvette sibling. The stealthy exterior. No flashy anything and no roof rack just pure function.  ",A overdrive 5th gear. More hours in the day to enjoy it!
4.625,Big fun with a price,drwooly ,04/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"Course I got this before the current gas problems, but I don't care! With the 6.0L engine, this is a blast to drive. Feels very solid; better than my last; 2004 Silverado Crew Cab. AWD really feels good. Mileage is worse than expected, but not horrible. (The same as my Silverados' 5.3L engine) Road/Street combined around 14-15 mpg. Have found 1.5 mpg difference between 55mph, and 65mph. Build quality vey,very good. No problems, 4,00 mi. into it. Just a good, less expensive Corvette, with a big trunk!","One doesn't stand out, although I love the Bose 6-CD radio. Love my music. (XM rocks!)","Why couldn't aftermarket-tpye mileage enhancements come from the factory? Air intake, tuned, dual exhaust. Only complaint is ride w/ low profile tires. Feel all bumps in the road."
4.625,Fast,Midnight ,03/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"The wife wanted a hybrid, but nothing caught my except the TBSS.  It has a mean muscular stance.  We bought one in Red Jewel Tintcoat. Just a beautiful color. It is fast, roomy, and handles real well. I like big trucks. I'm a big guy, and even though the HHR was better on gas, this works the best for us.  My wife drives it to and from the train station and we use it on weekends. If I had to drive this to my work every day, 80 miles roundtrip, I wouldn't buy it because the gas would kill us. This is one awesome vehicle and is a lot fun to drive.","The exhaust note, the Bose sound system, looks, color.","Dual exhaust! Remote start, and aux jack in radio to play MP3 player."
4.875,Great SUV for the money,Ron ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I was a first time buyer of a Toyota product and after two years traded it on a Chevy TrailBlazer, best thing I've ever done. Great ride, plenty of power, good ride even on the long trips, good gas mileage, lots of head and leg room. Just a great fun to drive SUV. Next time I will stick with GM.",,
4.875,Chevy's SS package does it again!,SS Man ,02/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"For all you SS lovers out there, Chevy finally answered back!  This SUV has it all... power, suspension, body style and all the options you need cruising at 100mph.  I've had no problems with the windows rolling-up at high speeds (like another review I read) and the new 4 speed transmission allows a lot more than torque than any 5 or 6 speed can handle.  I own a 2002 Camaro SS with a 6-speed manual transmission and could've only prayed for a 4-speed manual!  Less shifting.... more driving!  If you like stlye, comfort, power and most importantly SS packages buy this SUV now before there all gone.  I recommend the the Black Granite Metallic for paint.",V-8 6.0 LS2 with cold air induction,"Auto window up, not just down."
5,A compromise,Drew ,02/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I'm 6'5""tall with long legs and after spending nearly a year trying find a SUV that I could fit my legs into and drive without my knees hitting the driver's door armrest on the left and a place my right leg comfortably without hitting the stupid center console, which most exaggerate these days. The Trailblazer was the smallest SUV I could drive without bumping my legs or knees somewhere and get acceptable gas mileage. Even the new Tahoes have less leg room. Tried the Acadia too, No Dice! Pretty sad when most cars don't fit. I really like the vehicle, got all the bells and whistles I need and it's comfortable, fun to drive and handles well. I traded in a '99 Yukon w/230K miles on it.","I like the OnStar, the driver info center, comfort for a tall driver, Bose sound system, the ride is great. ","Owner's manual says there are three radios, one w/6 CD changer, one that plays MP3 CD's and one that does not. No way to know until after you buy. Chevy does not offer option 2 on the web or at the dealer's. They'll let you buy one for $495 at the dealer's even though it's not in the owner's manual."
4.75,"Nice looking, reliable SUV",Rickster1959 ,01/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Purchased as used 2008 Chevy zone rep. demo. Fairly priced as a demo/used vehicle. Great looking ride!, Interior is very comfortable . Cabin is fairly quiet and well appointed. Lots and lots of features included with the 3LT model. Love the heated leather seats and mirrors. Bose stereo is unbeleiveable! Plenty of power is to be had via the famous Inline 4.2L inline six cylinder engine that I have read so many favorable reviews on. Standard trailering package is a welcome standard feature. So far, this is the nicest vehicle I have owned in over 32 yrs. I drive many miles per weeek, so Chevrolet 5 yr., 100,000 mile warranty is a valuable feature!",,
4.75,Gotta Love GM,GMFanatik ,01/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Coming from an 07 Cobalt SS/SC with some decent performance mods, this SUV is a beast. I am quite impressed with the comfort, performance, daily drivability, and overall fit and finish of my Trailblazer SS. Stopping power, go power, and manueverability are very surprising to say the least. Surprising in a positive way of course. I would not recommend the dealership I dealt with, but I would highly recommend picking one of these up.","I love how clean the body lines are, the hidden power, and the overall ride comfort. It's also nice knowing that not many have any clue of what this vehicle is capable of.","6 speed automatic or manual transmission would have been extremely nice, and beneficial for much better fuel economy."
2.75,Think twice before you purchase this,stick w/honda ,01/20/2008,,,5,5,1,1,,1,5,1,3,"I had my truck for 3 months and steering was shaking violently and brakes were even worse.  Took it into the dealership TWICE, but they could find the problem which is still going on!  I had a Honda for the past 10 years without a single problem.  I regret going with GM.  I don't feel safe in it and very hesitant transporting my children in it.  I hate this truck and how  I fear for my safety in it. Traction light is always coming on and the traction warning light comes on too.  I was told it is ok by the dealership and it would reset itself when I turned off the car.  It does, only to turn right back on 5-10 minutes later.","Comfortable, nice interior",Needs more cup holders and more cubby holes.  Might think about a better breaking and steering system too.
4.375,Good Bang for the Buck,andrecan ,01/20/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,1,5,"Coming off a 2004 Z06 lease I wanted to keep some ""Vette"" in my life w/2 kids and frequent trips to snow country demand AWD. While no Vette, it does instill confidence leaving tolls or kicking down to pass at any speed. Ride is nice and handling is good for this size vehicle. Seats are comfortable. Window doesn't close properly properly at high speed. I have to slow down, then close to get proper fit wout wind noise. Also transmission wants to slow this car down when you try to coast at about 68 mph. which makes it challenging to keep a steady foot in traffic at that speed. I like my wifes FX45 2x better but after comparing stickers I'm happy.",Of course: 0-60 time. Agressive looking front and side profile OnStar hands free linked with Verizon family plan is awesome.,Gearing: Quality: GM's continuing problem with Key - Steering lock mechanisms. It sticks (it did that on both my Vettes too). Duel Exhaust pipes on the other side! Shave some pounds off somewhere..
4.75,Great Car,Larry Marquez ,11/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,Most of the people that I know including mechanics love this car. Now I know why. It's a joy to drive.

4.25,TrailBlazer SS: SSweet.,Matt Peters ,11/04/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,3,5,"Not many changes for 2008, but all together the vehicle is a fun and comfortable muscle-truck. The throttle response at all rpm ranges is strong and allows for a fun drive. The tight sport-tuned suspension leaves one with the feeling of driving a car much lower to the ground. The sound of the Corvette LS-2 engine is evident at idle and even more so in high rpm. The full option electronic interior with heated seats and leather/suede wrapping make for a feeling of luxury most GM SUV's don't allow for. Overall, the SS is very sporty in exterior and interior styling, strong horsepower, and tight suspension with the interior luxury factors making it desirable for even standard SUV fans.",LS-2 engine. Suspension. SS style interior,"I know 2008 is the last year for the TrailBlazer, but why not use the 5 or 6 speed tansmission with the automatics when plenty other SUVs use them.  That leads to my other suggestion: better gas mileage."
4.625,Great Buy,nick ,11/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"If you're looking for an SUV look into this Chevy. Yea, the gas mileage is terrible, but it handles great, has great looks, and plenty of cargo space. The styling cues are great, and with the usual large Chevy rebate you can get this truck affordably!  This is a must consider",LS2 V8,Move the stupid seat belts.

This has so much power, it's hard to imagine a SUV can give this type of performance. If you looking for a family vehicle that is fuel efficient, this is not your type. If you want something fast with the capabilities of a SUV and comfort, look no further. ","Tires and rims are a great. Really I like all the features XM radio, Bose speaker system, and OnStar are standard with this vehicle.  ","The brakes don't seem as good as they should be when in comparison to the performance.

4.5,High Performance SUV,Alan ,10/22/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,This is the most fun SUV I've ever driven. The power is super & the handling is more like a sports car. If the bad mileage doesn't bother you this SUV is hands down the best performace SUV out there. Only had a minor problem so far & it was fixed promply. Where else can you get a Corvette engine & handling package in a SUV.,The engine & suspension are among the best including lots of much more expensive SUV's & cars. GM didn't hold back on the SUV.When you push on the pedal lots of jaws drop. People that bought much more expensive SUV's should have driven this first.,I'd like to see a 3 way harness available.
