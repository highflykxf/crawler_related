5,"Wonderful car, great ride, best cargo room, 32 mpg",DDOlson ,05/25/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,"For cheap and good this is the real deal. First of all this is my second HHR. I bought the 2006 first off the assembly line. I never had a single problem with it until 200,000 and even then the problem was easy to solve. I must preface this by saying my husband is a great mechanic. We maintain every car we own as a 10 out of 10. Many of the bad reviews I see here I think are caused by people beating their cars into the ground and reselling them as junk. Seriously people, don't buy a used car until you've done your research, test drove it and had a mechanic check it out. And buying from a back lot small time dealer is a real roll of the dice and you'll pay much more for a car from a factory type dealer. My 2006 I finally sold at 220,000 just because I didn't want to have anything happen out on the roads in Minnesota's weather. That said the problem I did have was BATTERY GENERATED. You must replace newer car's batteries every 3 years. If you do not, cars today are so electronically generated from the computerization to lights, sensors etc. you start getting warning lights, sensor lights, power downs etc. as the batteries age because the old battery cannot support the juice needed to run the car. The cargo room in this car is better than any other its size and MPG. My son can get two bass bins and music gear galore in it no problem..I use to get ladders and dressers and beds in mine!!!!Its the best for this. Also the inside car handles are cheap plastic and wear out. My drivers side simply broke in two but One You Tuv=be video later and a replacement part at NAPA, and it was fixed at home.Now my son graduated from college. We bought him a 2008 HHR used 91,000 miles on it. Believe me it took weeks and a 7 hour road trip to buy the right one. There were tons out there but over priced, poorly maintained, a real crap shoot if you don't know what you are doing.  I was very surprised how people just out and out try to deceive you about vehicles. I am so glad I have a reliable person to check things over before purchase. Our 2008 has the 2.2 engine and does get 32 MPH with the cruise on..my husband claims without the cruise it would be more if you drive it a certain way. The guy we bought it from even did the 100,00 0 maintenance on it all ready with the high end platinum plugs. New front tires-smooth ride and we really kicked the tires on this HHR before we bought it and drove it 7 hours straight to get it home. And the person who said they could have gotten a VW-good luck with that and buying used. I had VWs for years. If you do not do the routine maintain on them at a rep. certified VW place at thousands of dollars, the vehicle is crap and a money hole. A used one maintained is hard to find.",,
4,BRAKES OF HELL,T. Rogers ,03/01/2016,4,5,5,,,2,4,3,3,,,"I purchased this 2008 HHR LS Wagon 4dr car used on February 15, 2016 on Presidents Day Mon.  As far as RELIABILITY - Wednesday, I was at the repair shop to let them know when you first get in it to drive to work in the morning...it will not accelerate properly.  At lunch time it does the same thing.  But as you get going it doesn't do it again for the rest of the day.  When I got to the service/repair shop they had me sit in the lobby, then they came and got me and asked me to ride along with the mechanic so I can tell them what I'm talking about.  It never did it again in the presence.  Of course the next day it did it again.  As far as PERFORMANCE/SAFETY - On Saturday February 27, 2016...I got into a 3-car accident, I was the third car.  the car in front of me instantly stopped I SLAMMED on my brakes in which I had PLENTY enough time to stop, but the BRAKES WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR.  I'm telling you my daughter had a 2006 Chevy Blazer and those brakes stop on a dime.  Other than the safety...the car looks amazing.  The electronics, sound system, interior, style, everything is great as far as that.",,
1,Don't buy this car,Steven smith ,12/26/2015,,1,1,,,1,5,2,1,,,I have a 2008 Chevy hhr 2lt with the 2.4 engine. For two years I have been deal with a major brake problem the master cylinder and power brake booster has been replaced and to this day the break paddle goes to the floor. It's has been to the dealer and to brake max and they can't even fix the problem all they do is bleed the  system. And you can forget it out. don't even think about doing emergency stop because the brake pedal just goes to the floor it's kind of scary when you're doing 65 miles an hour down the freeway.,,

Had it to 4 garages before we knew about recall and no one could diagnose the problem. Had ignition fixed, and now this morning, same. 75mph, Semi swerves to miss crushing her.

We bought it used with 25K miles on it and save a bunch of money than buying it new. It was great at first, but then all sorts of issues started popping up. The rotors have needed replaced 3 different times due to grinding. The CD player stopped working for some reason, but the dealership replaced it for free. The drivers side lock always sticks and I've gotten locked out of my car before with my children in the car because the key fobs also are cheaply made and don't work properly. The newest issue is that the Passlock feature is malfunctioning due to a microchip error in the ignition!!! Trading in for something else. ","Body, hatch back",Get ride of the Passlock system!
4.125,Good Car but has some problems.,FFDice ,09/24/2010,,,5,5,4,3,,4,4,4,4,"This was my 1st new car ever. I always liked the look of classic cars and this car caught my eye. I bought this car during the gas price boom and it didn't disappoint me. Average MPG 24- 26. The car does have some squeaks and problems, but still a good car. Dealership has taken care of all my concerns. Back seats lower and can haul a lot of stuff as long as its not filthy dirty.","Good looking car, OnStar is a plus, has all the bells and whistles. I like the small front windshield. Great gas mileage, good handling, and good acceleration.","Armrest is too small, needs better reliable parts. Had mold growing on the condenser, stabilizer bars on the front end needed replaced. Rear door locking mechanism needed replaced. The front of the flare for the rear tires are all scratched up. Chevy should put mud flaps on all of them."
4.625,Red Rocket,Dave Henry ,09/17/2010,,,3,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I bought the car sight unseen, and it had a different seat than the one I tested, and also a sunroof, both of which cut into the very limited headroom. The car is a blast to drive, especially since I added the dealer installed turbo upgrade. Handling and precise steering are surprising in a retro wagon. I have major problems seeing out of the car. The roofless/windshield design make me crouch down to see overhead traffic lights, and the center windshield rear view mirror obstruct vision severely. Also, there's a huge blind spot when changing lanes. The 4 speed auto is missing at least one gear, as the turbo is always trying to make up for the huge gaps. I'd get the manual trans next time.","The motor is very powerful, yet economical. There's plenty of cargo space. I love the styling, and with the SS trim, it gets even better. The steering is very good; precise, and accurate.","I don't know how they'd do it, but the sight lines are beyond terrible for a tall person. They're actually unsafe. The engine has a decided rattle on cold starts, but all SS's do it, so I guess it's normal, just off-putting. I'm actually looking for a replacement, even though I love the car. Not safe"

4.5,Great Little Hauler,Notcho Trouble ,06/20/2010,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,4,5,Usually drive with the back seats folded down. Use to haul lots of items for work and play. Made a carpet for the folded down area and use plastic if hauling something that's dirty. It fits quickly into the hidden storage. Great in the winter I have oversize tires on alloy wheels. Had a problem with brake wobble but dealership took care of it. It does take me longer to get somewhere cause everyone stops to ask me how I like my HHR Looking to buy another one.,Great radio and XM. Fun to drive and parks anywhere.

2.875,Buyer Beware,michaellrar ,06/13/2010,,,1,4,3,2,,3,3,4,3,"Bought it for the ""fun factor"" and was disappointed. It has massive blind spots. Also thought I purchased new and the dealership sold me a demo and did not tell me. Found out after I got my papers in the mail. The controls for the window are in an unsafe place (they have since fixed that I heard). The drink cup holders are a joke at best. I am a big guy so the seat belts take an act of congress to fasten. And did I mention the wimpy armrest that points down when lowered. The tires have the constant tire pressure monitoring system so I am constantly refilling the tires. Needless to say I only drive it about 6,000 miles per year and that is when my daily driver (a 2002 honda civic) is being serviced.",sunroof; gets 29 mpg highway,None.  Would not recommend buying new or used.  It depreciated 50% when I drove it off the lot and nobody wants a used one at any price.
4.375,Few Bugs,sortafan ,05/22/2010,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,5,5,"Pretty much got what we paid for.  Fun to drive (once you learn how to see out of it), great storage and gas mileage in the 30 mpg range thanks to mostly freeway driving.  You get used to the quirky window control placements and cup holder issues.  But remotes both failed, radiator sprung a leak and ignition failed (couldn't turn off engine one day).  Those thing shouldn't happen in first two years.","Ease of folding down seats, retro look, storage capacity -- holds a bicycle with right set of handlebars.","Air filter more accessible, spare that works on front tires as well."

I get compliments on this car everywhere I go.  I have used the storage capabilities of this vehicle countless times.  Both the rear seat and the front passenger seats fold down, with extra storage in the ""trunk"" floor.  Quiet ride, great stereo system with the 7"" sub in the back. Mechanically, this HHR has performed flawlessly.  Not a single problem.  Due to the extended rear end of the HHR, there is a blind spot in back that makes merging lanes a bit tougher.  Nothing terrible, but check twice before you make your move.  Love the HHR!","Looks, ride, storage, MPG.  Best car I've owned in years.","They have fixed this in newer models, but the cup holders are placed annoyingly under the armrests.  Addition of electronic blind-zone alerts in the mirrors."

I must have a lighter foot than some in rural and city driving I avg 26 mpg and on the highway I avg 32.  I traded a Mazda 626 in I was looking for another Mazda but was none in stock.  Glad I made the switch GM got me back after 20 yrs of owning Dodge and Mazda.  I am thinking of going to the SS HHR.",Excellent seating like being in a pickup.  Love the leather.  Love the retro styling looks good sitting next to our 1950 Chevy Pickup.  ,Winter traction has a lot of room for improvement.  I guess having the wider sport tire is the issue there.

4.125,HHR good but needs improvements,star5838 ,03/07/2010,,,2,5,4,5,,4,3,5,5,I bought my HHR in 2008.  It really does get 30-32 MPG highway. It is very versatile and easy to drive. You get a lot of nice features for your money. I drive 400-500 miles per week so I spend a lot of time in mine. ,"I like the tinted windows, on-star, great leg room (front and back seating).  We are tall people with long legs. I can whip a u-turn in a tight spot with ease, and it is a nice little wagon for small loads, trips to the garden store or such. ","Get rid of the shifter for the automatic! Very poorly located cup holders! It the useless shifter was on the column the cup holders could be located forward.

I average ~26 to ~27 MPG and have been amazed at all the stuff I can carry in the back with the seats folded down.  Extra storage UNDER the floor is nice also when you want to keep handtools hidden.  I could use a little more leg room for my left leg when driving though [the wheel well kinda sticks up there] and the center window controls take some getting used to. Heat/A/C work wonderfully and sound system is nice also.  Lots of headroom is nice and yeah, that cargo capacity =)  ","Cargo Capacity & Gas Mileage!

The center mounted window controls take getting used to. Small windows as well, just means you have to actually look instead of glance. The 2.4 engine has plenty of go.

Styling preference is very split for this model. If you like 40's retro hot- rods, then this is for you. Dollar for dollar, although not as socially prestigious, from a performance perspective. A GM Perf upgrade is available that maintains the full factory warranty, but raises the power quotients to from stock 260hp/260ft lbs torque to 290hp/315ft lbs torque. Torque steer is mitigated by a standard launch control program.",The HHR SS is a true sleeper;  Unexpected performance and handling thanks to the factory 260hp 260 ft/lbs torque can spin the wheels in 3rd if desired.  The launch control and competitive modes are also something you wouldn't expect is such a practical platform.,No dome light override. A console rattle had to be found and stopped.

So I'm stuck with theirs. When the rotors get wet and I brake, the entire front panel shakes. I've already repaired it 2x (warranty) and it has occurred again. I don't live in the desert so why have a design that warps when wet? I had a Saturn SL1 from 1995-2001 which sat lower than this car and never had this problem. This is my LAST American car.

Sure, I could have bought a much better car, but not at anywhere near this price (2008 used , 11k miles, under $12g). I have a bad lower back but I can adjust the driver's seat so that I'm comfortable for hours. Mileage is good. Gauge placement is excellent (in my previous sedan, no matter how I adjusted the steering wheel, I couldn't see the speedometer). MP3 connection is a lifesaver on long trips. Visibility could be better. Only 3 cup holders, but I have 5 kids  I can't encourage drinking in the car.

The hhr has done  exactly what I want. It handles great at 75 mph with no wavering behind the big rigs. The steering is sharp and precise however the torque steer is a brute.

I have to admit I first only bought because I nailed the price. The dealership didn't even fill my tank! I stole it and really didn't care that the only gas left was what I had put in it for my test drive.

I see the hard surfaces in the interior as a virtue, since my kids always come back muddy from bicycle sports events and its durable as easy to clean for this purpose. I opted for the SS version that was engineered by GM Performance Division. It handles like a sports car and has the acceleration of a rocket. My experience with actual fuel mileage is about 27.5mpg for combined 70/30 hwy/city with the 2.0L Turbo. I'm very happy with my HHR SS and it fits my specific transportation needs well.","The HHR SS Turbo is so much fun to drive that it is almost addictive. I didn't expect this level of driving experience. The styling is ""love or hate"". If you understand what it represents, you'll be a supporter. I am a hot rod fan and this is a little piece of styling nostalgia that hits the mark.","The standard transmission models do not have center arm rests on the seats.

The test drive was in a loaded LT, which made the car too costly and too gadget-laden to make me leery of potentially costly repairs. My interest in the car held, however, and a year later I test drove an LS with essentially just ABS and side airbags as options (std on the '09s). I liked it. Bought it.

I'm still very happy with the LS model, it may not be as fast or as stylish as the LT or SS models, but for just driving back and forth to work and around town it works perfectly.","I really like the cargo space when the rear seat is folded down.  There are also a couple of extra little cargo spaces built into the rear area that I just recently discovered. They aren't huge, but are a good place to store an emergency blanket, flashlight, etc.","My biggest complaint is the lack of storage area in the front.

4.875,Great for young families.  Love it.,Jonathan ,08/28/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My HHR is an LS with manual transmission. It's comfortable, fun to drive, smooth ride, and with the manual transmission the acceleration is much better than the automatic. I test drove the automatic and thought it was sluggish. My manual is not sluggish. I'm surprised and impressed with the car. It's roomier than I thought it would be. I have a young family and a tight budget, the HHR is big enough for rear facing car seats and front passengers. It's a hard quality to find in affordable cars.","The seats. They are the standard base model seats, but they are suprisingly comfortable. Also, I'm new to driving a manual and it is cake.","Visibility is slightly limited. I think larger windows would help, but that is a style redesign therefore a little unreasonable."
5,I love my car,Patsy ,08/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this car. It rides and drives great. It's fun, comfortable, smooth, and peppy. My mom has a Toyota Camry, and this little car rides just as good. Does good on gas, and is equipped the same as a luxury car. The back is great for hauling groceries, and the seats lay down for hauling larger items. I went from a full size SUV, and I have'nt missed a thing. The extended warranty GM offers is great. I hope to have this car for a long time. I am slowly adding new accessories to dress her up. This vehicle is like a little truck, SUV, and car all in one. Why would anyone want a regular vehicle when you can have one of these. Drive one, love it!","The smooth ride, it's peppy, fuel economy, fun to drive, sporty, and luxury all in one. Great sound system, great features on my LT. Lumbar seats are comfy. Plenty of leg and head room. GM offers a good warranty. I wanted to buy American, and I am glad I did. You will love this car.","The only thing I wish I would have gotten would be the 6 CD player, verses the 1 CD player. I have a lot of old tapes, no tape player. But The radio is great, so I find myself not using the CD player as much. I have the panel LT, had to get used to using my mirrors. "
5,Small car with a big punch,Not your average man ,08/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased my 08 HHR over 2 months ago to take the gas pump burden off my wallet (HHR $55 evey 10 days vs $90 every 4-5 days with my Silverado). I now find myself driving this car all the time and my 07 Silverado may get driving only once or twice on the weekends. I drive 35+ miles to & from work during the week and when I can lock the cruise at 60 the car will get 35-37 MPG. I am a 6'5"" tall lbig guy and I have no problems with leg & head room (no sunroof - have the issue seeing the stoplights when first in line. I get a lot of people askng about the car & the fuel MPG's, the GM Performamce Air Intake makes a huge difference. My neighbor loves my HHR and wants to trade in her PT Cruiser.","Great gas mileage, comfortable seating for a base model, huge interior room for passengers & cargo. I tried several other makes & models, even the Colbalt and this has a lot more room for tall people. The HHR retro exterior looks better, carries more & is way more comfortable than the PT Cruiser.","Center console would work better than the arm rests for a tall guy, they are way too low and block the cup holder.  Lighted window switches, the LED on the ceiling does work that well when you have the manual transmission, the stick is always in the way. More accessories like a OEM woody panel kit."
4.25,Ex-Suburban owner goes 4 cyl,Je ,08/23/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,3,4,5,5,"I have been driving Suburbans for 30 years and finally caved in to the current gas prices. I couldn't face going into a small car, and decided to test drive the HHR and found that I really liked it. The ride is comfortable, I sit a little higher than a car, and the 4cyl engine seems to have enough pickup as I drive on the expressway all the time. After 2 months of driving this vehicle I find it fun to drive and the gas mileage is great!  The only undesirable is the loss of power when turning on the air conditioning.","Easy to drive, great gas mileage, not too much money.",A little more horsepower to counteract the air conditioning drain on the engine.

And many features for the money.The remote start will be nice in the winter. I'm not an autoworker but I would like to see GM make the HHR at the Morine plant that's going to close next year. I think that would be a good move for GM and the people in Morine. ,The retro back end and tinted windows.

I own a computer repair business and I'm absolutely nuts about the shelf in the rear cargo area not to mention the 61 cubic feet of cargo room. I had one problem with a passengers side kick board that came loose sometime right around when I bought it. The dealership took care of it promptly.,"Auxilary input jack, shelf in the back, spacious interior, the car's elevated disposition","Improve rear blind spots, particularily on driver's side. Also, the front windshield needs to be larger. Passengers should have handles on the ceiling for when I make some crazy turns!"
4.125,HHR water leaks,BRANDOGGY ,08/07/2008,,,2,5,3,4,,5,4,5,5,"My '08 panel HHR developed a water leak somewhere in the body of the vehicle. The dealer had it for a week and say they fixed the problem. That is yet to be determined. Problem was found when I took it for an oil change and discovered 3 lights out. I took it to the dealer and there was 2 inches of water in the rear floorboard from where the rain got in. The water shorted out the electrical system. My advise is to keep a close eye on your HHR particularly in the back seat area.  If you detect an oder of mildew or notice any lights out, take it to the dealer at once. Other than this problem I love the vehicle",Outside appearance. Good power and good MPG,Too many blind spots. Interior design is poor.  
5,Awesome car with soul,bubbak ,08/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Was looking for a fun, practical vehicle to pick up after dumping a boring mini van. The HHR is awesome. Old School styling with soul, modern but comfortable interior.  Right on the money for a small family. We took delivery of our hhr just a couple of hours before taking a beach trip.  It was so cool loading up the vehicle with all of our stuff and seeing it actually fit.  Perfect mix of people room vs. cargo room. Quiet, solid ride.  Average about 27 miles right now. Tough but still low-pro design. Chevy knocked the cover off the ball with this one.  ","Cargo room, people room, fun to drive, gas mileage, styling, aux input jack for mp3 player. Solid quiet feel, remote start is awesome. I can start this car up from inside my office",Put some type of console or tray up front instead of the armrests. They get in the way of cupholders.  
5,Good enough to get two!,Chuck ,07/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"First impression of the looks was that Chevy was just copying Chrysler, but  after taking a test drive, I was hooked. I've had it now for 7 months and taken two long distant trips with it (avg 31 MPG AT aprox 75mph). It has a very quiet ride inside. I installed a hitch on mine for a utility trailer (which works great). The wife and I liked it so much I traded the wife's car for a second HHR in June 08! Now we both have one! I don't think anyone can go wrong buying one of these. Even with the entry level model, they pack a lot value and usability into this vehicle for the price range it is in. So go buy one, heck, buy two! You'll love it!","Quiet ride, sound system, head room. Storage room with seats folded down. MPG highway. All the standard gizmos on base LS model, floor mats included. Styling inside and out. Overall value for the dollar is great, and fun to drive too!","Window controls take time to get used to and should be mounted on the doors.

5,What a car! Wow,Richard ,07/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a great car, style, looks, fun. I am a senior who has owned many cars including a 54 Vette, SS396, Mercedes, etc. The HHR SS is a fun car with great mileage and the best thing- It's a Chevy. I am amazed at how well it handles, moves on cue and turns heads. Welcome back GM. Keep making cars like this. I would recommend this car to anyone. ",I like them all. Love the OnStar.,The cup holders could use a redesign. I have rarely used them for cups. But if I did they are awkward. 
3.75,Still too new,Dave Henry ,07/26/2008,,,4,5,3,3,,4,3,4,4,"Only have about 2000 miles so far, but that includes a couple of nice road trips. The first trip was all 2- lane roads of wildly varying altitudes, and lots of corners. The car is very confidence inspiring, with excellent grip, and crisp steering response. I was a bit surprised at this, due to the electric power steering, but hey, it's just my opinion. Maybe the only handling negative is the amount of corner lean when pressing, but considering the car's mission in life, not at all surprising. Averaged about 24.5 mpg in fairly brisk driving. The second trip was 90% freeway, using cruise control.I averaged 28.5 mpg over two tanks with average speeds of 75 mph. ",I like the styling of the exterior the best. Great utility in the interior.,"Needs more headroom. I have to duck down to see traffic lights, and my head bumps the sunroof edge. I'm only 6'2"". It's called ""Heritage High Roof"", right? One touch driver's side, open only? Should be both fronts, and both directions. Steering wheel controls are pretty small;especially the volume"

I've only had my new HHR (LT Special Edition) for a couple of days, so I'm not able to rate the reliability or fuel economy yet. So far, so good!  I love the retro styling - very spunky! Even my style-conscious 20 year old daughter approves! My HHR is very quiet and has a smooth ride. I'm impressed with the roomy seating areas, as well as the cargo space!  It's an added bonus that there are two height options for the cargo 'floor'. The seating is very comfortable; lots of headroom, even with the sunroof! Very enjoyable and fun to drive.  I compared a lot of vehicles - the HHR gives the most for the money!  ","The OnStar and driver information center are great bonuses; also like the extra glovebox. Good stereo system sound, tinted windows are easy to see through from inside, but provide privacy from outside. Seats are comfortable; love the driver's side adjustable lumbar support and fold-down seats.  ","Would prefer a center console instead of the front armrests - this would feel more sturdy and would provide extra storage, as the glove boxes are small. Visibility is hampered when the driver's side visor is being used for the front window.  "

The 2k rebate then sealed the deal. This is a nice car and I am glad I bought it! (But Chevy could have done a much better job with the poor front window vision, tiny glove box, few cup holders and better emergency brake placement ","Pros: good mileage, nice info center with avg mpg, instant mpg, avg speed, tire presure, nice sound","Cons: Hard to see stop lights, a couple inches more of front window glass would really help!

The warranty will ensure good service on major items. Interior is adequate for me. Fun to drive and since I am not a NASCAR driver wannabe the negatives the professionals give it do not matter.

Also, it had to be comfortable & roomy enough to take 2 adults and 2 large dogs on a cross-country roadtrip when needed.  The HHR fit the bill perfectly. Tons of cargo room, especially with the seats folded flat. I love this car, & my wife does too.  ","The passenger seat folds flat so you can fit that really long cargo in. Need to pick up some drain pipe and 2x4's at the Hardware store? No problem.  Also, the 2.2L engine is great.  Silky smooth,  lots of pep, and power to spare.

It has a lot more interior room than appears from the outside and will actually seat four adults comfortably, although if you are going to carry four people on a regular basis the 2.4 engine or turbo would be a better choice. If I had to make the choice over again I would buy the same car.","Gas mileage and interior room, beside which it is just plain fun to drive.",Make the windshield about two inches higher to make it easier to see traffic lights.

It's faster than most SUV's and CUV's out there, has more cargo room than most, and gets between 23 and 26 mpg combined. OnStar, XM satellite radio, and hands-free calling are all standard. For a few extra bucks, you can add the OnStar navigation package. The only two gripes I have about the vehicle are no grab handles and the engine is a little on the noisy side.

We were lucky enough to find an Orange HHR that had a quarter panel (not a full panel). Since we needed at least five seats, the full panel wagon was out of the question. something about the missing side rear windows that make this car very appealing. The quarter panel is a great place for self-expression. The placement of the window controls is a little weird and takes a while to get use to. For some reason I keep hitting my shins on the door when I get out. On the plus side, the OnStar is great, it's American, has lots of room, and it comes with mats.","Styling, MPG, color, interior room, comes with floor mats, good rear seating, rubber rear mat, OnStar, two back up lights.

5,First Impressions,Chad ,06/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I researched many new cars before deciding on the HHR.  My wife and I test drove five cars (Dodge Avenger, Dodge Charger, Subaru Legacy, and a Chevy Malibu) and looked at four or five others. Although we almost bought the Malibu we both agreed the HHR would be more practical for us (we have three kids and the Malibu had a small trunk). I've only been driving it for a week, but so far I couldn't be happier. We bought the 2LT with every option. The standard equipment looked a bit unfinished.  The leather interior really made the difference for me. It's strange but this is the first time I have liked a car more after I bought it than before. I don't know what else to say. It just fits.","Exterior styling, interior amenities, leather seats, good performance with good gas mileage, the head turns I get when I pull up at a stoplight.","I see many people complain about the window controls in the center console, but I don't mind them.

4.5,Fun to Drive,bb ,05/26/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,5,5,"Just bought my HHR a couple days ago and so far I'm really enjoying it. I went with a pretty stripped-down model, but the difference in features wasn't worth the extra money. I would recommend the 5-speed over the automatic, the ride is a lot better and it's really a lot more fun. If you can afford a little more the SS model is awesome, but I didn't feel it was worth 8k more then the basic LS model that I purchased. It's a very smooth ride for a smaller car, handles nicely on the freeway and driving through town, plus they unique style gets a lot of looks and compliments.","Gas mileage. I've been driving around for two days and the gauge hasn't moved.  Sporty looks, even without all the extra features.","The cup holders are in a very awkward location and there are only three of them.

The gas mileage seems like it will live up to its word which is excellent due to the ever rising prices. It seems to handle well. It's pretty sharp looking. I cant wait to take it on a road trip. The cargo area is spacious. Center console is really up on dash which is neat I guess it takes place of non existant middle console. To me it has the feel of an SUV which I like. I feel the value was great for the money.,Body style is unique.Get lots of looks. Comfy ride and good gas mileage!  ,The main dome light is almost clear to the back of the car.

Engine performance impressed me because it does not feel like the if the vehicle is coming apart on hard acceleration, handling and braking are both top notch and they work hand in hand with the engine power. I drove the 2.2L and 2.4L engine's but I will definetly suggest upgrading to the SS.","Overall performance, storage space, smooth and quiet ride, aux outlet for i-pod, bunch of extra features that others don't offer or you have to pay for.

I'm 5' 7"" and if I was one inch taller, my head would touch the roof. The seat side bolsters bite into the side of my back - not too comfortable on long trips. After a 1,200 mile trip last weekend I got 25.2 mpg but the tailpipe got really carboned up and the oil got pretty dirty. Dealer says ""it's normal"" - which I doubt.  Oil was somewhat overfilled from the factory and I'm hoping it just blew out, causing the tailpipe (somewhat oily) buildup - time will tell.",Turbo performance,Make the car a little wider so there is room for a center console.  Also make the front seats about 2 inches wider.
5,Excellent Car for Fun and Economy,James ,05/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased this car a month ago after researching the auto, it is well made and fun to drive.

4.5,Loads of fun to drive,aah ,05/12/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,4,5,"I've had my HHR for about a month. I bought the 2LT model with the 2.4L engine. All I can say is the car is loads of fun to drive. I keep finding excuses to just get in the car and go somewhere.  Performance-wise, the 2.4L engine is decent if a bit slow on initial acceleration. Handling is actually pretty good with the improved suspension that comes with the 2LT package. Brakes are a bit weak though.  Interior room is great.  I traded in an '03 Sonata and the HHR has a lot more room in the driver's seat and is much more comfortable to drive.   Visibility can be a bit of an issue until you get used to its blind spots.",Styling: I like the retro look. Loads of cargo space for a small car. Overall fun to drive.

I keep my office in the back, and can haul material with the rear seats down. And the front seat folds down for a desk for my laptop!

4.75,Forget the other models.....get the SS!,drstein1977 ,04/28/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just bought this car last week, SS models are hard to come by. I have to say I am glad I didn't get the 2lt, this thing blows away the other HHRs I test drove. I have the automatic so there's less HP but the design and features on this thing are second to none. No turbo lag and this thing hugs corners as well as my 2000 Trans AM WS6!  Definitely a good family car with a very sporty edge!  Two tone interior is nice. Extra options I bought: 7speaker pioneer system, sunroof, XM radio, and other cool stuff. Definitely get the SS!","The smooth stiff performance suspension, and the power. You have a lot of power on command when you need it.

4.625,Very Fun Car,HHRfan ,04/21/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,3,5,5,5,"I did a lot of research before I bought my HHR, but I was surprised at just how fun this car really is. There are a lot of extras and small touches that make the car  something special. Of all the cars I've ever owned, this one makes the best impression.  Contrary to some reviews I've read, the handling is fun. The ride is as smooth as glass, and the steering is very responsive. It's amazing how tight it turns in parking situations. I can make u-turns in very, very tight circles. The small windows and windshield give the car a fun attitude when you drive, too. The novelty of the doesn't get in the way, though. It's not over the top. It's just fun. My favorite car ever.",Very nice interior. Lots of gadgets and gizmos. Smooth ride. Excellent gas mileage. Driver information center. OnStar! (my car has a phone number!) even the base audio system sounds great. Very fun to drive and ride in,.

3.625,2.4LT,Matthew ,04/18/2008,,,4,4,3,4,,3,4,4,3,"I would say I am generally happy with the car. The gas mileage is fine (mid 20's), the power is fine (the gear ratios need to be adjusted), the options are very good (I opted for all options) and the ergonomics is good. It is very weasy to get my daughter in and out of the center rear seat, the rear volume is better than I orig thought and the styling is unique.The two things I would change would be the location of the power window controls and the number of cup holders available. The only complaint is the the roof liner glue does not hold with sunroof models and the dealer does not have a clue as to how to fix the issue. I would recommend this car to a friend or family member.","Options, safety ratings, comfort, accessability, styling and ergonomics.","Window controls, cup holders and sunroof liner glue."
4.75,Lots of Fun for Little Money,Susan ,04/16/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I didn't set out to buy the HHR but when I saw everything it offered I'd be foolish not to! My Equinox lease was up and wanted better fuel economy and lower payments.I have been averaging 24 MPG. With gas at over 3.45/gal this is awesome.  Purchase price was low -allowed me to buy it keeping payments in line with my lease. Rides smoother than the Equinox and cargo space is the same or even more.I really love the manueverability - it has a much bigger turning radius compared to the Equinox - I just zip in and out of places. I knew pick up would be slower but it makes me drive safer. It does get a lot of looks - either you love it or hate it. I like different anyway so it's right up my alley,"OnStar, On-board telephone allows you to buy minutes-great when you forget your cell phone. Remote starter, terrific storage features, cute fluorescent night light, map light on the mirror, comfortable seats, cool dash lights, nifty computer readout on the instrument panel - love knowing my oil life","You need to jazz up the console to match it's retro style, window controls need to be on the door, need better outside colors to choose from - maybe some historic colors?

4.875,Proven Wrong,goodsinbad73 ,04/05/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have only had this vehicle 1 week now and I must say I am now on the bandwagon. At over 6'2 lots of room to spare. I love my panel it gets looks from everywhere. There are only 2 bad flaws I have found. Because the front tires are so big they throw dirt and rocks..fix. Get running boards or tire guards. 2nd. Because of my height the window controls for both windows are in a bad spot if you need to roll down while in motion. They should be located in the door. It is flawless other than that. I love it.,Room for tall people. I test drove with 2 large adults well over 6ft and over 300lbs. Easy fit for both. Nice soft ride. Awesome gas saver.

4.5,I really love this car.,Michael ,03/28/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"The styling, accessories, feel, and comfort are great. I do agree that the braking and handling need some improvement.  But all in all, I'm very happy that I bought this car.  ","The chrome package with 17"" wheels sets off the entire look of the exterior. Inside there is everything that you could need. The OnStar and XM radio are wonderful and the extra sound system really set off the need to take long rides.","Braking is weak, it takes a lot of foot power and additional distance to stop this thing.  The handling isn't as responsive as I would like.  Some of the curves on Tennessee roads can get a bit nerve wracking. "
4,SS HHR,dotes ,03/24/2008,,,3,5,3,3,,5,4,4,5,"Purchased a 08 HHR SS and have been enjoying it. Even with the high performance turbo charged engine, I get decent gas mileage. Of course using the various readouts and the cruise control helps too. Of course there are some minor things that I don't like. But at least the window controls are back where they should be on the SS. Having to go through two tire changes when a flat occurs on one of the front tires will be a real big pain. But I have roadside service. I rented a HHR for a week a few months before. So I could see if I liked driving it. I did and waited for the SS model to come out. I got the victory red and have got several comments on the HHR. So far I like the HHR I have.",The turbo charger for when I want power and the launch mode is great too. The overall body style and look of the SS is fantastic. The soverall placement of the instrument readouts isn't too bad. The storage room is just the right size for me. The safety equipment standard and optional I got,A outlet in the rear area would be nice. To be able to raise or lower the drivers seat. Of course the 2 tire changing requirement on the front tires when one goes flat. The center console isn't much to brag about.   
5,So far so good,bernie ,03/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After reading all the brake problems, i hope this will not happen to the ss. I just bought a red ss and cannot tell you how pleased I am with it. With the 260 hp eco tech turbo engine, it is a little rocket. The ss specific interior is comfortable and well designed. The 5-speed shifts firm and quick. The exterior ss specific ground effects, 18 inch wheels with speed rated tires filled with nitrogen, paint finish and door gap fit is the best I've seen in a long time. Oh yes, the smaller steering wheel and quicker steering make this thing loads of fun to drive. It is quick. It also has larger 4-wheel disc brakes that stop great.  so far happy as a clam with it.",260hp of course with 28-29 mpg. Its good looks. Stands out from other HHR's.

I drive it hard and am getting 23.5mpg. But I think 1st gear is a bit low, lots of torque steer at full throttle. It is a handfull if driven very hard.

Went from a Subaru with a very choppy uncomfortable ride to my 08 Chevy HHR which rides smooth has great storage excellent control panel giving all the stats you would want/need.

4.625,Nice Little 'UV Wagon,Boston Guy ,03/13/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"So far so good after two weeks of new-car ownership. I traded an 04 Chevy Astro Van with AWD for my HHR 2LT with the 2.4L 172HP Ecotec engine. Gas mileage is not as high as I was expecting, so I am trying to modify my driving habits a bit and see if that makes a difference. Right now I average about 24mpg between in-town and highway miles. The larger engine gives adequate pick-up at on-ramps onto the highways, and I have found myself going 85mph without trying! Quiet and very smooth ride for a small car. ","High quality interior parts (mostly), smooth ride, solid feel, exterior and interior styling, fit & finish, leather seats, driver's info center, 270 watt stereo, versatile interior.","New cupholder location, relocate window buttons to doors, improve quality of plastics used on dash and door panels, improve lighting for front of cabin (the under-mirror lights should swivel), a control for 'night-light', move gas filler door back to drivers' side!"
4.625,Looks Great,Kim ,03/06/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I have enjoyed the ride but there is a bit of a blind spot at the edge of the windshield and the side window. Take an extra second to watch for pedestrians. I also see they overestimated gas mileage efficency. I'm about 20 mpg not at all near the 30/24 on the window sticker. I drive mostly in the city so I know that doesn't help. The car size is great for the city but I chose stylish over hybrid because the mileage estimates were the same. I would have stayed with the hybriyd choice had I known the mileage was going to be so far off. It does always get a ""wow"" and I never had a car before that did. The double looks it gets have been fun to see.","The car starter and mp3 port are nice as it the central storage over the dash. Not much for storage places, but I like zen in a vehicle, not turning it into my office or spare room.","Only 3 cup holders is odd, work on having a fold down rear seat tray with two cups that become a divider and arm rest for rear passengers.

4.625,Amazing,sirwillo ,03/01/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,The HHR has been a huge surprise.  I paid 14k for a new 2008 ls.  It is far suprior to other cars in its class when it comes to usablility and comfort. The most impressive part of this vehicle is how smooth and comfortable the ride is.  I travel about 30k a year so I needed a vehicle that would get great gas mileage (i avg 33 on highway) and was comfortable enought to drive for 5 - 6 hours in.  On top of that the storage area is awesome. Lots of space in the rear witha great changing configuration.  ,"Avg 33 mpg highway, comfort, storage, and quiteness of ride",More power outlets

Wish I had purchased it in the first place. The Scion was very limited in color selection, had lower MPG, tough to see stop lights, only one back up light, even with a pioneer stereo the sound was not as good as the HHR's. Buying American was nice. I just love the HHR!","Color selection, simple audio and heating controls, rear storage area, smooth ride, plastic instead of fabric in back of seats, the display color, large side view mirror.","More storage, more cup holders in the rear, bigger door pockets, the rear window is a little dark, the map lights need to be brighter, wish gas cap was on the driver side."

The engine is very well powered for a 4-cylinder, road noise is much quieter than a lot of other models, and MPGs are good considering the amount of storage space and the fact you can easily fit 4 large adults in the car.  I read there used to be an issue with stone chipping on previous models, however 2008 comes with a thick protective film on the surfaces at risk from stones and that film seems to work great.  Even the film doesn't show signs of impact.  Only issue has been my auto light sensor failing.  Sometimes it won't allow parking and interior lights to come on with headlights.  Manual override doesn't work.","MPGs, storage space, adaptability, stereo (Pioneer version), OnStar, seating space, looks","Cupholder area is a little tight, but will hold my travel coffee mug fine.

This is an inexpensive, economy vehicle with some flair and modern features. The info panel is fantastic and interior versatility is top notch.

The little thing they put on the dash is very lacking.  The seats are uncomfortable. The space between you and the passenger is almost non existant. Really cramped feeling.  No console between seats and the cup holders are the worst I have ever seen in any vehicle. The arm rest sit too low to be of any use.  Window control location is very poor.
