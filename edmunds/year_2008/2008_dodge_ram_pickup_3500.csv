Engine issues so far started with all the emissions garbage; 3 turbos, 2 injectors, MAF, FRV and Rail Pressure sensor, 3 low pressure fuel pumps, 2 valve bodies, seat motor, both headlight lenses delaminated. Repairs so far have cost about $3,000, just within the last 6 months. Poor fit and finish have also plagued this beast; wide door and hood gaps, door and dash rattles, fragile interior plastics, poor seat padding and more. The Miata of crew cabs; tiny rear cab area.
This past year the truck has been down more than it has run; I don't see how anyone using this truck commercially, can make money. If you pull an RV, look elsewhere.","Comparitively speaking, repairs are easier than the other HD brands; at least I can see the ground and block from the top of the engine bay. Parts are also relatively cheap, if you shop around (usually, big rig repair shop have OEM Cummins parts much cheaper than the dealer). And the engine is the only industrial design of the 3.

Stock, the 6.7 has much more grunt and this driveline is superior in all respects. All the complaints about emissions, fuel economy and injection systems are common across the big 3. Don't harp on Dodge-Cummins builds these engines and Uncle Sam demands clean tailpipes. As for fuel economy; with mandated ULSD I bet you won't get mid 20's out of the 5.9 anymore, either; in fact, I don't remember getting above 20 in my 04'. Don't buy into driving harder to kill C.E.L.-lazy dealer.","Style: always loved the big rig style since the 94 redesign.
Real truck features: Cummins, large coolers, big brakes, exhaust brake, big mirrors
Towing capability: may not be the newest, or flashiest, kid on the block but feels most like a real truck compared to the others. Rock solid towing compared to my 2000 Super Duty. Steering is spot-on and responsive.
Fuel economy: get the same mileage pulling my toy hauler (about 11,000#) as my Ford pulling a 6,000# 26' TT (9-10 @ 70 MPH)
Suspension: awesome ride for a 1 ton 4x4.
Interior: vast improvement over my 04. Fat steering wheel and audio controls.
Voted most likely to last the longest out of the big 3: being more ""old school"" can be good!","TRANS,TRANS,TRANS!!! Downshift WAAAAYYYY too hard when in tow/haul and exhaust brake engaged. I've had sodas come out of the cup holder when towing my RV. Take lessons from Ford-6R140 much better at this.
Build quality: the new trucks seem to be much better, but mine has several panels that don't quite line up and a drivers door that is very ""tinny"" when you shut it. The steering wheel leather is miscolored at the top and damaged. Drivers side carpet missing large chunks beside seat. Radio quality marginal at best (Walmart grade Infinity speakers).

The reason I gave it a ""2"" on fun to drive is that it is not fun to put gas in this truck at the rate that it consumes it."
3.5,suggested improvements,harvey ,06/21/2008,,,3,4,4,5,,4,2,3,3,I noticed that my '08 ram 3500 megacab seemed to have about half the power of my '05 3500 ram. giving it benifit of doubt because it only has 20K on it and they get stronger  at 36K So far no problems used as commercial vehicle towing 30 foot goose neck. dodge has the most uncomfortable seats make with out question. engine brake should be on steering wheel not on dash. Not sure what idiot decided to put it on the dash. i would have preferred dodge leave the 5.9 in these trucks. It's bulletproof all the power in the world. the '08 is a a bluetech  is a very clean burning diesel. My exhaust pipe is still as clean as if had never been started. Never smokes under any circumstance.,"Looks, cummings engine is the only reason to buy a dodge. You need to run you 6.7 hard some time or you will stop up the two converters and burn out your turbo. Mine is on road long haul so no problems if you run short trips or in town you will have problems",design better seats lumbar support built in. For God's sake put exhaust brake on steering wheel where you can reach it;
4.375,2008 Dodge Ram Megacab Laramie 3500,Jason ,05/26/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,2,5,"I upgraded from a 2006 2500 4x4 CTD 6 speed manual. The difference between these trucks is night and day. I feel the build quality has improved over the 06 Ram, interior materials seem to be better. The 08 Ram has a lot more power then the 06 and the exhaust brake is a nice feature.The leather seats are nicer and more comfortable then the cloth. Ride is actually softer in the 3500 then the 2500. The truck handles better as well. Cup holder still sucks. Wish they would improve it. Engine is very quiet, more quiet then a 07 Duramax. You cannot hear the engine at highway speeds, the wind noise is louder! Over all the truck is very quiet and refined. Laramie package is a must! ","Quiet more powerful Cummins, exhaust brake, sound proof glass. Sunroof, Satellite radio, steering wheel audio controls, trip computer, heated seats, power rear slide window. No diesel smell! You can almost stick your nose in the exhaust pipe while it's running, and not smell a thing, Honest!","Cup holders!!, come on Dodge make better cup holders. Improve fuel economy, like the 5.9 had. "
4,still not sold on the 6.7,oilfield trash ,04/02/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,4,3,2,4,"I do a lot of heavy hauling 40 ft float with oilfield tools i cannot say how awesome the 5.9 liter 6 speed manual truck is it was in my opinion the best truck yet this new one seems to have a dead spot in the tranny foot goes to the floor sometimes without a downshift until its slows down 25 mph and it says it has more hp than the 5.9 but the tranny drags it down hard I own a 5.9 auto 05 and work truck is a 6.7 auto 07 I lined them up side by side and the 5.9 ran away from me same thing happened with a trailer even my mpg went down with the 6.7 i was getting 23 mpg hwy with the 5.9 and about 17 with 6.7 with almost 40,000 miles on it my word of advice find a 5.9 liter used with a manual tranny",good lookin truck,don't agree with dodges new drivetrain package its sluggish and i just don't think they did cummins name justice 
4.875,Great truck,james aitken ,10/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We just got our truck last month and we love it. We upgraded from a 2500 hemi to the 3500 dualy with the mega cab and were amazed with the amount of room and power in the truck. The dualy was an unneccesary feature for us considering the most we ever tow is 8,000 pounds, but it is nice knowing that there's not much out there that you cant tow. The only reason I put an 8 on fuel economy is that it only has 1500 miles on it right now so it isnt broken in enough to get more than ten mpg. This truck is so much fun to drive and I've gotton so many compliments on it. It looks so good at night with all the lights on it.",The huge cab -the way the seats in the back fold flat. The interior leather. The towing capacity. All the storage areas in the truck. The bluetooth. Cummins deisel. The engine braking that you can turn on and off,A bigger glove box in the front. that thing it tiny! The chime on the seatbelt gets annoying too. Other than that it is a great truck and I think well have it for a long time
5,I Love My Truck,M Laube ,10/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my 4th Dodge(3rd dually) and they just keep getting better. I traded my 05 Dodge dually only because of the high milage and no extended warrenty.  Being a female on the road a lot with horses, I need reliable transportation. The 6.7 Cummins has incredible power, the truck has a smoother handle, the interior is very roomy and comfortable. I love the reclining/folding back seats. Not to mention the fact that this truck turns heads everywhere I go. The diesel enginge is quieter, but still grunts ""powerhouse"". The exhaust brakes are awesome, although I only hauled 8000lbs which was probably too light for that feature.  I can drive the Mega or the Porsche convertible.  Sorry Porsche!","Exterior looks, increase power, the mega roomy back seat, smoother ride, exhaust brakes, great sound system",I'm having a tough time adjusting to the standard short bed.  It feels likes the horse trailer is coming through the back window.  I'm used to the maneuverability of the lwb to get me out of tight situations.
5,2008 Dodge 3500 mega cab 4wd,Bill Dowdy ,09/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is the third Dodge Ive owned. I traded in my 97. The 6.7 has lot more power than I expected, what a beast,and good mileage considering I'm pulling a 16,000 pound trailer, getting around 10 mpg. The room in the mega cab is outstanding, love it. Dodge you did good on this one, Thanks.  ","Room, radio, power, seating, 6 speed auto.","Built in brake control like Ford has, other than that I'm happy."
3.875,50k and no mud flaps,jdavis ,09/14/2007,,,4,4,3,4,,5,3,3,5,"I did a huge upgrade from a Toyota Tundra for the increased towing capacity for my new camper. I love the truck, the power, and especially the interior size. What a monster....won't even come close to fitting in my garage! This is my first American made truck and was a little discouraged with the cost of the ""extras"" Overall it is a great truck with more towing capacity than I will ever need. ","Cummins pulling power, huge interior and reclining rear seats. Beautiful leather seats as well. Quiet for a diesel and the cruise control works great.","One thing that is so irritating besides getting nickle and dimed on the options ($200 for a bug guard??) C'mon Dodge...no mud flaps on a $50,000 truck? Also could use plastic on top of the bed side rails and the tailgate unless you plan on covering it with a spray-in. Interior carpet is cheap also."
