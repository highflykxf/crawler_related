Looks, comfort, visibility,craftsmanship, paint, raw power, transmission, tow mode - all better then expected.Did I mention the power - a 10 plus! My pick-up is a 4X4 with 1800 miles on the truck, from sea level to 5500 feet altitude in 270 miles, pulling the 5th wheel trailer the trucks trip computer says 8.0 mpg at 65 MPH. In town average 13-14 mpg. I got 7-8 MPG with the motor home and lived in the slow lane. Towing at 70 MPH up hill with my Super Duty is effortless. ","Looks, inside and out.

A very smooth running truck and quick off the line.

Only 9-10 mpg around town. This is not a truck for running errands around town, but met my expectations for a long road trip. I have been told to expect the mileage to improve as the engine breaks in and it seems to be heading that way. The truck ran very well, very comfortable, very quiet and reliable.","Great looks, very comfortable.

Had my truck running near my friend's older super duty with diesel. His truck was much louder than mine.","Improve the mileage. Improve the navigation system. This is my 3rd vehicle with a navigation system, the other two being GM products. The GM navigation system is definitely more sophisticated.

I had to add some options after market that could be standard. Overall, seems like it will be a great truck.","Instrument gauge cluster, large center console, Bold styling, interior space, King Ranch seats are the best on the market. Reverse camera is a nice option. Tow command is a nice option to have with the ""AUX"" upfitter switches.","Needs car seat latch anchors, much larger garbage container (it is useless due to size.)

Not impressed yet with my first diesel. Getting just under 13 in town without a heavy foot. Ordered this with most everything, so very nice. Hard to deal with the lack of throttle response. Seems like diesel is working way too hard to move truck up to highway speed and could be related to base weight and 3.73. Pushing 3.55 to boost economy = dog.
