2,Big Chunky Ride,Dan ,09/13/2015,2,3,3,,,1,5,4,2,,,"Weighing in at 3800 pounds is the reason its big chunky. Its also the reason the car is hard on control arms, tie rods, and suspension. The motor is solid but it revs down real slow for some reason and has a ""hemi tick"" in the winter when its first started. Also a gnarly delay when you stab the throttle and when the rpms actually react to it,,, weird. The instrument panel has awkward half points that don't anything in between the floor / seat / dash air options. When turn the AC off or change from floor to dash position it actually takes about 8 seconds to respond. Full size sedan the corners stretch far on the blind spot beast.

Read several reviews n others complain of the same problem.  Why isn't this a safety recall because I don't like driving a car that no one can fix.  After taking my car to Olive C. Joseph, I had a vacuum leak which they fixed n the Charger is running fine.  Lesson learned to Google problem then you can go to the Dealership and have them check it out.

4.625,Best vehicle I have ever owned!,lyss ,11/16/2011,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,I bought my charger in late 2008 and I still own it. I cannot seem to find myself wanting to trade it in due to having no problems with it.

Got it used so it needs the 60k service soon (at 58k now) but checked out on Carfaxs and we got the go ahead from our mechanic, along with an extend warranty. Handles better then my old Intrepid and much better then the v6 3 ton Pacifica. Best drive on highway 101 I've ever had, and I know I have the power to pass if needed, along with fantastic brakes to stop. No knocks, trany problems or electrical problems but I don't hot rod it or floor it all the time. Very responsive and forgiving at the same time. If you buy used, take it to the mechanic first.

great brakes. ",Dumbest location of cruse control I've ever come across and why must it be a nob now? Miss the radio control on the back of the steering wheel that was on the Pacifica. Bluetooth mic could be a lot better.
3,Update to my review from 8/6/10,jagon91 ,08/14/2011,,,2,4,5,2,,3,4,1,3,Fell in love with the car and my only problem then was the hard shift in the transmission. Now not only does it do that all the time but my mpgs have gotten worse. My steering column has gotten stuck while driving around a corner under a bridge which in turn messed up my turn signal lever. Also the sentry key is a joke. New battery every 2 weeks for that thing. not cheap at $8 a piece. The key died and I got stranded over an hour away from home in a small town that had only had a gas station. Talked to dodge about my problems but they wouldn't do anything to help at all. They wanted me to replace my key for $245! Never will I buy from dodge again.,The styling is amazing and the handling is as well. I can honestly say it is VERY durable. Hit a deer one night going 65 and all we got was a very small crack in the bumper and the grill was knocked a little loose. ,"New transmission, a key that doesn't die so quickly, better quality materials inside, better a/c(I understand its a big car but a Huge Tahoe cools off faster than this thing), smaller steering wheel, better visisbility.
Between the horrid blind spots, poor reliability, and dodges abysmal customer service I will never own a dodge again."

I've been driving this car for about 6 months now & it sill amazes me. Mostly no cars on the road can compete with it (there's only a few that can). Given the aggressive looks on the outside, the blazing speed on this beast, the enormous amount of space in the interior, etc. This car is like no other (its in a class all by itself). Especially when you factor in all the great features and qualities this car has for the amount of money it costs this car is among the elite. I can go on & on about this car but my best advice is to drive one and see for yourself.","The best features of this car are the hood scoop, the half-inch lowered ride height, the twenty inch wheels, the spoiler, horsepower, torque, the amount of space in the interior and the trunk, and the Srt badging on the inside and outside. Overall the layout of this car is bar none one of the best.","This car doesn't need too many improvements. However, when driving on roads that aren't smooth you do feel the bumps very easily. Other than that this car is a beast. Gas mileage is actually pretty good considering how much horsepower & torque it has. It won't hurt to add more power & reduce weight."

I loved the Chargers styling but what blew me away was the handling and the speed, granted I only got the 2.7 but its acceleration, handling and comfort blew away the Mazda 6 and Honda Civic and easily equaled the Taurus SHO (except in acceleration) and the BMW 3 series.

So far I have had no technical issues at all and it has been rock solid so far.","Peppy and excitable 2.7 L V6 is a true pleasure and regularly averages right around 30 mpg unless I cane it everywhere I go.

4.875,No Buyer's Remorse Here,Brian ,12/08/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I ended up purchasing this car after my 2002 Grand Prix was totaled. So far, the Charger has been everything I was hoping for.  The 3.5 engine at 250 hp has plenty of pick up for this heavier car.  It handles very well, the ride is smooth, and from the interior the engine is seems really quiet. Going from FWD to RWD was a slight adjustment, especially in winter driving conditions, but the RWD Charger has held its own, even going uphill on black ice.  The interior is comfortable,functional, and simple, not flashy or luxury-like. To date, fuel mileage has been surprisingly good, equaling or bettering the Grand Prix despite a lower fuel rating. It's a fun car and I'm an very happy with it.","Engine performance, outside styling, interior room and truck space.",Column between rear door windows and back window creates larger blind spots so you need to be careful when changing lanes.

I was traditionally a Ford guy, but I now have 2 kids and the backseat of the newer Mustangs just didn't cut it. It is a perfect nominal for me. There is plenty of room for the kids and plenty of horsepower for when I don't have the kids.I have taken the car on some far trips and have gotten 24 mpg on the highway. I average 15 in the city, but I have a heavy foot.",Horsepower and the my gig entertainment system. Retro look.,Side airbags should be standard. Horrible place to put the cup holders.

All the features you can ask for, bluetooth, navigation, heated seats, power, awesome looks, growling engine! MDS allows the car to cruise in 4cyl when you punch it it goes to 8Cyl. I added mopar exhaust and mopar cold air intake to add some MPGs and more growl and it definitely makes a wonderful difference. I receive a compliment every single day, no lie!

On cruise control at 75 miles per hour the only indication MDS was active was the ""Fuel Saver Mode"" message was on the DIC. The performance tuned suspension on the Charger is more like a touring setup rather than a race car. Probably the most comfortable ride I've ever owned. This car will definitely get some looks around town and it's hard to resist my right foot urges too. It has all the cool toys with  Sirius  and MYGIG infotainment center.","Hemi power-awesome!

Buy brand name and the recommended 89 instead of minimum 87 if you plan on driving this thing like you own it.  I had some hesitation and stuttering at WOT acceleration, cleared right up when the gas shortages forced me to a different gas station than usual and 93 instead of 89 cleared up completely!   Ever since then I've been running 89 from name brand stations and it hasn't come back.  I get so many comments it's not even funny","Performance, price for performance, quality, and semi-retro styling","Go more retro, especially the grille!  There is a great amount of aftermarket parts already available, I'm waiting for a 68-70 style grille to be fitted though to complete the retro look. The Challenger is much more true to form.

When I drove it it felt like my Mercedes, but has the speed of an American muscle car. Its tight, solid fast, and built. It had a mileage problem, but that was taken care of with an air induction system. 3 mpg pickup and 20 extra hp, plus it sounds good! And the transmission is outstanding. Made in Germany! I have had 6 back and neck surgeries, and these are the only adjustable seats I found that make driving a pleasure. Mine's solid black and I tinted the Windows legally black. Wow. I've got an American muscle car in a Mercedes body!","The exterior design draws attention everywhere. I was afraid to park it until a seventy year old gentleman in a beat up old pickup pulled up next to me at a stoplight and yelled ""damn that's a bad--- car!"" at me. The car has the look, sound, the comfort, the feel and the power. Thanks Dodge!","Only complaint is the fuel mileage,but its a little better than my 20 year old Benz. I have every option available.

I do not use it and wont till I am forced to. The car performs very well under hard accel and handles like a dream. I am looking to trade it for the SRT8 as I want to go to 425 HP . I was going to go with Challenger but refuse to fork over 20K extra for availability markup. The R/T will quench most driver wanting high end performance as well as daily driving. I wasn't thrilled about 4 doors but I drive it, not sit in the back. GREAT car for 24K and I think most will be happy.

Gas mileage on the highway is fantastic but around the city is very disappointing I can actually watch the gas gauge dropping as I drive. Chrysler's hidden secrets in their warranty details are a little sneaky. If you have a problem with the car and you take it in to have it looked at if theres nothing found wrong you will be charged labor as they will not cover that under warranty, not a prob with makers like Hyundai.

When the transmissions shifts between 1st & 2nd gear it feels like I am driving over railroad tracks & it does this every time I stop & take off.  The dealership says this is normal and it should work itself out after I have drove it 3000 miles or more. They also say that 1/2 of them do this & 1/2 of them don't. I don't even want to drive it.

In short, just an extreme pleasure to drive!  More features and creature comforts for the money and tied with outstanding performance, its a combination you just cant walk away from.

5,Foxfire!,hombre ,01/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have always wanted to kick myself for selling my 1969 Charger (a 383 with a 4-barrel carb.) but now I'm over that.  I've finally found a car that is more fun to drive than the '69.  The 2008 RT has better performance and handling and all of the luxuries provided by 21st century technology.  Way to go Dodge!,"Understated muscle with a Hemi, AutoStick tranny, Sirius radio, GPS navigation with UConnect system, 6 Boston Acoustics speakers, dual zone automatic temperature control, roomy interior and trunk, reasonable economy for a full-size performance car and at a reasonable price.",The only way to improve it would be to make it as a coupe with tilt-up headlights!
5,I Love It - SRT8,Neferet01 ,01/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Dodge lady forever! I have the ""SRT8"". When you step on the petal, it doesn't ask any questions, it just goes. I love it. I also like the ""option"" of choosing auto and/or manual. I don't care to much for stick shifting and it kinda helps me. Super easy to change shifts only should you choose to. I just love the speed on this monster. It's the best car I've ever had.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Again, be aware...it takes off like an airplane, for real - no kidding. My husband almost missed this flight. Turns out he wants one too...  ","The speed is out of this world, auto/Manual change of shift   ","Driving over a bumpy road the suspension is unforgiving (You really feel it)- just make sure your tires are inflated properly to minimize it. Way too much break dust, rims sometimes scratch on sidewalk if your too close, uses a little too much gas, but it's worth it.  "
4.75,New 2008 Super Bee owner,Girl Super Bee owner ,01/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I just bought the new 08 Super Bee, after owning an 07 Purple Daytona RT. Love this car.  I thought the Daytona was fun.  The new My Gig is awesome, and love the Blue pearl.  Ride and steering feel tighter than the Daytona. I got number 046 out of 1000.",My gig.  Of course the power and sound of the engine. Brembo brakes too. Bluetooth is great.,
5,Love this Car,T K ,12/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I absolutely love this car. I had been driving a Lincoln Aviator for a bit, but test drove the Charger and instantly feel in love. The power is awesome. The interior is very stylish and comfortable. Even though I've only had it a couple of days...I don't think I'll ever get rid of this car.","Stylish interior, plenty of leg and head room, great radio and sound system...and of course the power.",None at this time.
4.375,Bang for the Buck,Captain Midnight ,12/04/2007,,,4,4,5,4,,5,4,4,5,"I'd like to say that this is a great car, but we will go with good for now. The ride is smooth, comfortable and quiet, and I'd be fine riding in it for hours without undue fatigue.  The steering gets raspberries because it's too heavy at all speeds and the chassis is busy at cruise.  The most fatiguing part of driving this car is the constant inputs required, even on smooth, uncrowned roads.  I really hate that part.  The stock 225 60R18 touring tires grip well in the dry and are a menace in the wet.  First thing I did was to get Goodyear Eagle Ultra Grip GW3 snow tires so that I can get through a Michigan winter without ending up in a ditch somewhere.  Recommended with reservations","The HEMI. Plus, it's delightfully sinister looking.  Great cornering grip on dry pavement, minimal body roll for  its size.  Ride is smooth and the cabin is quiet.  Mileage isn't bad at about 18 mpg combined and compares against the 14.6 mpg my 2005 Ram 1500 4x4 HEMI returns","Accelerator is like an on-off switch and needs to be more linear.  Ease your foot into it for low-speed maneuvering, and nothing happens.  Then it suddenly lurches, no matter how smoothly you modulate the throttle progression.  Steering effort is heavy at all speeds and requires constant input. "
5,Best car I've owned,romman ,11/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought this car over the weekend and love it! In fact I would say that this is the best car I've owned. I have owned quite a few cars and trucks over the years including Mustangs, Thunderbirds, Trans- Am, Dodge RAM pickup and most recently a Durango. I have been very pleased on how the car handles and absolutely love the sunroof since I live in CA. The seats are comfortable and Dodge finally did something with the 07 cruise control handle problem. I rented an 07 charger for about 10 days and that lever drove me nuts! Sirius radio is a nice touch and the rear air is nice for the kids! Everything about the car feels solid and the handling is superb. I wanted the myGig system but maybe next time","Power sunroof, handling, comfort and roomy trunk. Sirius satellite radio, iPod (input) jack, Key fob is cool since it does not look like a regular car key!",20GB Hard Drive for the MyGig system seems rather small since most iPods are larger than that. UConnect should be standard on SXT models and above since state laws are changing. 
4.5,Daytona Charger,Mikey C ,11/10/2007,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,3,5,"Wow. I know it's just a pretty version of the regular R/T, but their is just something about this car when you drive down the street in it's orange and black colors. The engine growling, and knowing that everyone can't help but look in interest. Sure, it's no SRT-8, but the mileage difference in MPG makes up for that. I am seeing abour 16 city and a cool 25 on highway. The pick up and go is strong and nice, and the interior is very comfy and roomy. I had a small Trans prob right away, but the warranty took care of that and no probs since. Good job Dodge!","The exterior design. The 350hp engine and enough tourque to twist steel, and surprisingly good V-8 gas mileage.","Too much hard plastic inside, and the blind spots are a bit too big."
4.625,"A Great, Fun Car to Drive",Larry ,11/07/2007,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"I've owned the car for only 3 weeks, but, love it thus far. It's enjoyable to drive, responds extremely well for a 4 dr sedan, but, yet has the appearance of a ""sporty"" vehicle which gets lots of attention from people. A joy to drive! I was disappointed in a couple of things--see below on improvements. I would buy this car again without hesitation.","Appearance is great. Response to acceleration is very good for a fairly heavy sedan. Overall, an extremely nice car to own. The lifetime warranty on drivetrain is a major plus. ","I am disappointed they took away the auto stick except if you invested in the more expensive packages, and, also they deleted the very good Boston Acoustic 6 speaker system....in my opinion these are  major mistakes.  The additions of adjustable pedals, and seris radio does not make up the loss."
5,So Far So Good,Siamese45 ,10/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have been a Dodge truck person since 1993 and when I saw the Charger, I was intrigued enough to drive one.  I picked it up last night and while it may take me 6 months to learn the MyGig entertainment system, I love the way it handles, the acceleration is amazing, it is very comfortable and quite stylish.  It will take me a while to get used to being back in a car, but I can't think of a better car to choose as my first in many years than the 2008 Dodge Charger R/T.","The acceleration would have to be my favorite feature, so far.  I have only had it one day so I am sure I will find many more favorite features over time.",Adding a shaker hood as an original option instead of as an aftermarket option.
5,Love this Car!,Tante Lise ,10/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I only have the base model Dodge Charger, but I love it.  It rides very smooth. I also like how it sits up higher than my old car (grand prix).  It is nice and roomy too.  Very comfortable to ride in. The seats make you feel relaxed and not strained.  I am short (5'2"") and it is easier to see over the steering wheel and dash in the Dodge Charger.  I cannot wait until I can afford to purchase a more ""loaded"" Charger with leather seats (heated of course) and the ""Hemi"". :)","Satellite radio, UConnect, large trunk, and comfortable seats.","For the base model I do not foresee any suggested improvements.  However, for the ""loaded"" model, I hope that they will not come standard with sunroofs when I am ready to buy one.  I do not like sunroofs."
4.75,My second Charger,NCarDebt ,09/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Beats the pants off of my  go mango Daytona!. You have to be careful with these SRT's as they hit high speeds pretty darn fast!. The Daytona was a great car (got totaled by an abandoned previously wrecked vehicle in the middle of a darkened highway, very sad) and a bit more comfortable as well as confident due to the less aggressive gearing and pc. I absolutely love the SRT!.",Power and traction,The rack and pinion could use some fine tuning for bumpier surfaces.
