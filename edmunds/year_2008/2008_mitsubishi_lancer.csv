2.625,"Soured On Mitsubishi By This Car, Money Pit",pxabstraction ,09/30/2013,,,3,4,3,1,,2,4,2,2,"Bought this at 2 years old with 30,000Km. Now has 80,000Km, 5 years old and I'm selling it.Pros: Good mileage, comfortable, everything still works.Cons: CVT autos are HORRIBLE. Transmission is lazy and car is gutless. Engine is noisy. Chewed through 3 sets of 18"" tires. Transmission cooler had to be replaced at 80,000Km, $1,500, should have lasted years more. Rear suspension needed $1,000 of work last year, also should have lasted longer. TMPS system cannot be disabled, does not show which tire is down, cannot remember more than one set of tires, constant paint chips, awful service.Car is a lemon. Very displeased. Will not buy Mitsubishi again.","Stereo is great (I'll miss the factory subwoofer) and the Bluetooth and voice control are very good. Power moon roof is a blast in the Summer Interior design means the car is comfortable for tall people like me, even though it's small. The multi-display unit in the dash is fantastic and if you're a stat nerd like me who's obsessed with your mileage, it gives a ton of great information on that front. Transmission has a fake tiptronic mode that simulates manually shifting through 6 gears and has paddle shifters. It's fun when you're on an isolated, bendy road or want assistance stopping quickly.","-Either improve (i.e. overhaul) the design of the CVT auto or dump it.
-Change the AUX in on the stereo from RCA to a 3.5mm headphone jack like every other manufacturer. Seriously, what were they thinking with this?!
-Allow TPMS unit to be disabled, user reset or at least allow it to remember more than one set of sensors at a time so winter tire users don't have to spend $100 at a dealer twice a year. At the very least, have it say which bloody tire is down! You've got an LCD screen in the dash!
-Have Mitsubishi Canada ""customer service"" actually pick up the phone when people call and return repeated voice mails. Worst service I've ever had from a car manufacturer."
4.25,5 Year Review 2008 GTS,mba0006 ,04/25/2013,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"I've owned my Mitsu for 5 years now. I am trading it in for a '13 Charger b/c I can afford one now. This was a great car! The 150 hp engine felt more along the lines of mid 200's. The cvt transmission is a bit sluggish in the low RPMs but the lancer is a fun car to drive. I am 6-2 and 200lbs. I felt comfortable in the lancer. The back seats were okay, very wide but not much leg room. The GTS is very sporty.The Rocksford sound is great! If youre expecting it to be like the Evo you will be disappointed, but the lancer is still fun to drive and has a practicle MPG and cost. Exterior noise was the one complaint (hwy speeds are noisy) but the RF sound can drown it out ;) For the price range A+","- Rocksford Fosgate Sound!
- 18"" Wheels
- Handling performance for a FWD
- Visually appealing
- I get 28-32 mpg on HWY
- never had any major issues
- low cost to maintain (non prem gas, normal oil)
- Leather wrapped steering wheel 
- Paddle Shifters!(GTS Model)
- Comfortable even for tall people
- Sunroof ","- CVT... Slowwww
- Loud hwy noise 
- Cheaper plastics in certain places (get what you pay for I guess)
- Gas millage could be better in the city for a 2.0L
- leg room in the back (only when the driver has the seat all the way back) if you're 5- something you wont have this problem. "
3.125,Just to let you know about some issues...,fdlbym ,09/16/2011,,,2,5,3,5,,2,3,3,2,"In a nut shell, if you're not impressed with the exterior design, just don't spent time looking at this one. Mileage is okay but not the best (low thirties on highway). Handling is good for its class but you can find other cars handles as good if not better (Mazda3). Leg room in second row is one of the best but is it that important? When it comes to shortfalls the list is longer; Engine noise is something to pay attention. Interior plastics are not better than what you would find on vacuum cleaner (similar to previous generation US cars). Together with weak engine, CVT makes you feel dead.","It's look. Standard safety features are better than most others (ABS, 4 wheel disc break, 7 airbags)","Better isolation for engine noise. Improve material quality (everywhere, from ac nobs to sun visor) "
5,Best car I have ever owned,jgskains ,08/30/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Although the it didn't have the horsepower I was looking for, it more than made up for it in every other aspect. It was more comfortable than other cars in its class. It was quick, fun, and handled like a dream. It never gave me any trouble and aside from the color I got stuck with I had no regrets. I don't recommend the automatic transmission I read lots of complaints about a lack of power. But my 5 speed had plenty of power. In the end it proved itself to be extremely safe. After hitting a retaining wall and rolling mine 3 times I walked away with out injury. I love this car and I will miss this car. Eventually I will come back to this car.","***Handling***
* Fuel mileage never lower than 25 and as high as 33
* Reliability
* Temperature controlled A/C
* Ability to lock the doors with the doors open.
* No trunk arms coming down into the storage space.
* Bluetooth on the steering wheel
* Comfort, the most comfortable car I have owned even on long trips and in the back.
* Plenty of room front and back
* Purchase price and cost of ownership

My blower motor has already went out and we just recently moved and now have a gravel road. I have dust coming inside the car from my glove box, all vents, my cd player, my steering wheel column, and all the doors. I contacted Mitsubishi about this and they will not do anything. It is a nice looking car but very cheaply made. My alignment has been fixed now 8 times (and I drive normally just more than most people). The steering wheel has started shaking extremely bad but the no one can seem to tell me why.

If, and it is a big ""IF"" this car had ANY redeeming qualities it would be the mileage, but who cares about mileage at the great expense of power. If you plan on passing anyone, make sure they are either riding a bicycle (and it better not be Lance Armstrong) or they are a little old lady on a motorized cart, other than that, you'll never make it.

4.25,Decent Car,mike ,08/23/2010,,,5,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I bought my mitsu in 2008 and am very surprised I don't see more of these around. I love the sporty design on the outside especially with the dark gray color looks exactly like a shark. The interior is comfortable and clean looking but some of the interior plastics are cheap. I also don't like the upholstery a kind of felt material that my dogs hair clings too. I find the gas mileage adequate but power is a little low;although through corners it definitely shows a sportier side. The rockford fosgate stereo is awesome as well as the easy to use navigation system. The tires make the car useless in snow because they are summer time ones. Also, starting the car is a little rough in really cold weather","Sporty exterior,and easy to use navigation, as well as the rockford fosgate stereo.","A good pair of all weather tires instead of the standard sport for the 18"" tires.Also, replace the upholstery with something more pet friendly and less likely to attract dust and lint.

4,Could have been perfect!,Eric ,08/15/2010,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,3,4,"Had the car for 3 years now, this car is like bi-polar to me, it can give me the greatest feelings on the road or just looking at it already creates emotions. It handles nicely looks like a shark and is pretty roomy for its size. What's sad is, it is near perfect but mitsu made cuts in bad areas thinking we would not notice. First thing I notice, rattles came in pretty soon, about a month after purchase they came from the road noise and when I turn the music at near half power speaker grills rattle and doors to. And this is the BASIC sound system not even with the sub-woofer in it. And the paint. Where is it? Oh! I supposed they put in more clear then. Nope! That's not what road hazards say. ","I like its stock features, like the 18 inch wheels, skirts and rear wing. Stock seats are comfortable and cabin is roomy. Steering feel is great, the brakes respond nicely and never lack power. The suspension reacts well and gives the car good predictability, the transmission is as good as it gets.","Better Plastics and finish,and why not less plastics.better road noise insulation,More paint and a better clear coat quality.

4.25,Check insurance price before you buy,Tony ,07/30/2010,,,4,4,4,3,,5,4,5,5,"We bought this car for my 16 year old son thinking it would be a nice car for him to drive back and forth to school.  The car looks and drives wonderful, plenty of power and great gas mileage.  Our shock was when we went to get it covered with our local insurance agent.  The price was outrageous!  I now see on the internet, it is right at the top of the list for most expensive cars to insure.  Don't make the same mistake we did; Check with your insurance agent first!",Gas mileage is great. Has plenty of power for a 2.0 liter engine. Handles wonderful.,The Yokohama tires are very noisy.  Change tread design on the tires or install a different brand to make it a quieter ride.
4.625,Great Car,Rob ,07/24/2010,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,4,5,"Just bought it about a month ago, I got it with the mud flaps and hood deflector. The hood deflector looks sexy (adds a touch of design at the front while it protects). No stone chips at all from me driving but it did have 2 or 3 at the front from the previous owner who did not put a hood protector or mud flaps on. It is the CVT auto and I don't know why people say it doesn't have enough power, it's plenty and when I switch to the manual sports mode, it goes well enough. Unless you want to race with this car, it's gonna cut it, plenty. It has more power than my old 96 civic which still had a lot of HP left. The paint job, might be a little fragile but it should technically hold out.",Everything! It's loaded and the Rockford Fosgate sound system rocks!,"More coats of paint and clear coat. Worse case, if the car behaves good and has a good record and new paint job 10 years from now would be well worth its design!"
1.375,Never again,PJ ,05/05/2010,,,1,2,1,1,,1,1,3,1,The most uncomfortable and most underpowered vehicle I have ever owned. Center console might as well be a concrete block. Paint quality is ridiculously poor; and need we even discuss engine power? Or rather lack thereof. While the mileage of the V4 is nice; having a V6 would be much better.  Hindsight is 20/20 and I should never have bought this vehicle. From about day 5 of ownership I tried to get rid of it.  Found some other sucker to buy it; never again will I own a Mitsubishi - stick to televisions.,"I'm glad it is someone else's underpowered, uncomfortable piece - does that count?",Stick to making televisions Mitsubishi.
4.5,For those with good taste,Alfred ,03/29/2010,,,5,5,4,4,,4,4,5,5,"I have owned my Lancer GTS since late 2007 and it is my first car. I did get it keyed by some ******  dog a month after I bought it (hopefully karma got him). Besides that, this car is excellent. I am in love with the 650-watt sound system it has and its navigation system. As for the paint, It has chipping and scratches over the front bumper but that's because I live in the northeast. I have had no mechanical problems so far which is a testament to Mitsubishi's renewed oath to quality. I would recommend getting aftermarket performance parts to beef it up. I think that the 5-speed manual is better since the automatic does not exploit all of the engine's power. No rust so far ha!",The aggressive styling and interior.

However, I am from Chicago so I am very much a city driver. The GTS fulfills my needs. My only after market modification is a K&N cold air, and my GTS is superb.

I added a K+N air filter, and an axle back Flowmaster 40 series exhaust, and noticed a performance increase and MPG increase immediately.  The sound system is great, gives a nice rounded sound without being overbearing.  The transmission is smooth, and the car can be tossed around with relative ease.  I love the interior design, there's beauty in simplicity.  Everything is integrated into the dash, making it flow wonderfully.  The only complaint I have is that after a year, the padding used on the rear dash to deaden rattles has worn out, causing vibrations with the music.  Annoying.","New style, inside and out.

Based on the reviews previously I had read & thought wow this car will have everything I've been looking for.  Afterthoughts of ownership - 1.5 yrs - car is lacking in quality at build. From day one I had asked the tech about engine noise above 2500 rpm. The cabin is always filled with noises of some kind. Recently, the rattles from the doors are killing me.  I warn those who buy this vehicle that any car that gives you a rebate will come back to bite you in the end. When they give a 5k rebate, that means you're now 5k down in what you paid for it.  ","I like the style of the body & the curves/lines. The upgrade from the previous body style really helps to attract buyers who need that ""Look at me"" feeling.","I do not like to say this, but Mitsubishi has always been known for using less than average quality on materials.

4.75,Fun for Teen,Hadeswolf ,09/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Had the GTS CVT for over half a year now, and I have to say, this car is extremely fun to drive. I paid a tad too much for this car, but it was worth every single penny. This car is great, looks aggressive, perfect for those teenage drivers like myself. Although I have to say I'm a little disappointed in the engine power, it's a blast to drive. The 152 hp engine could be a little better, certainly the 09 GTS with the 2.4 L 168 hp engine will be much faster. The fuel economy is rather good on this car. I get about on average 21 to 22 MPG. But for me this is hard to obtain because as a teenage driver, accelerating slowly doesn't give me a rush of adrenaline. ","The navigation system, and the sound package. The 600 watt sound system will give u the thrill. The handling on this car is superb. It can take corners easily. The sport tuned suspension is a great addition to this 08 Lancer. ","Engine power and maybe reduce the engine noise. The noise when accelerating is rather noisy, but that's nothing the 600 watt sound system can't fix."

It lacks a bit of power at first but fast once up to speed, and extremely fun to drive. I have taken it to a few mountain passes and driven it along the California coast and i couldn't be happier with it. The car handles very well with very good steering feel, although with the 18"" stock wheels on the GTS it can be jarring at times. Rockford system sounds great and the sun roof is a plus. Plenty of room for me and three friends. My only complaint is the use of some cheap plastics on the interior which tend to rattle a little with the sub turned up. Overall tho i LOVE this car!","Looks great. Stock 18"" wheels get attention. Handles very well with improved suspension on the GTS and multi-link rear. Rockford-Fosgate system is one of the best stock systems out there. Pretty good mileage (about 28/30 for me)",More power! Use of cheap plastics on the interior.

The car has been holding up pretty well. My only issues with the car has been the stock Dunlops which the dealership swapped out. They had a pulling issue from day 1 & they put on Pirelli P-Zero Neros instead. Now the car doesn't handle quite as well. Hopefully they will be better in the winter. The Dunlops were pretty scary! The paint on this car chips very easily! The front & right behind the rear doors my car looks awful! The Navi system is only current up to 2006! That is ridiculous! Mitsu's customer service has been quite poor. But overall, 10K later, the car has never given me any trouble. A+ for that.","Still the Fast Key system. Navi w/ 30gig hard drive. Looks. Mileage! Doing normally 55-60 on my 37 mile trip to work, I avg. now around 35- 38 MPG! Best so far has been a click OVER 38 for the whole tank. It can be done!","More sound proofing! When u have the moonroof, you don't get a light in back 4 the passengers. Telescopic steering wheel! A center counsel that you can actually rest your arm on.

I love the sound of the mivec when you get on it a little. There has only been a couple things I don't love about my new lancer: I wish the 5 speed had another gear; when I am cruising at 70 and my rpm are just over 3k, I feel like I am straining it even though I'm not. (it does have some crazy response in 5th though, jumping up into the triple digits with just a little push!) and gas mileage could be a little better especially with the way prices are going.

The new forward swept windshield keeps the sun out of your eyes, great feature in Florida. The engine is quick to respond for a 2.0 L, and you're hitting 80 before you know it. The gas mileage leaves a bit to be desired, but it's not horrible. The interior is wonderful, doesn't feel like it was built with cheap plastic parts. And the AUX port to plug in the iPod, thank god. I'm able to carry my entire music library.  Great car!","650 Watt Rockford Fosgate stereo with a kicking 10"" woofer.  Aggressive stance from every angle.  Interior design.

The Nav and sound system alone is good enough for a purchase. The car itself, unfortunately could have have been better. I found it sluggish. The CVT is almost unbearable. It feels like it's being pushed to catch up with the engine. The car screams to get going from a starting position. I think that a regular automatic would have been a better choice. This engine is supposed to be lighter and have impressive HP for it's size. My Suzuki Reno is faster getting to 60. Other CVTs in the market don't feel like this. I crank the radio up so I don't hear the motor. It also gets poor gas mileage on hard acceleration.","Like the Mitsu NAV sys and it's impressive features build in. Also like the sound system, paddle shifters and steering mounted controls. Overall design is good. The 18"" wheels are a great addition.",Either the engine or tranny needs improvement. They do not match. Sheet metal is poor and paper thin. Watch out !! Stay away from SUVs and carts in parking lots. Wider tires are needed. The stance would be awesome.

I can't leave it parked in the driveway, it's just to sexy for that.  It definitely needs to be opened up to get best results.  I have the fully loaded GTS, has nav, blue-tooth, great system and don't forget the paddle shifters.  The new Lancer gets great gas mileage and is extremely fun to drive.  I do enjoy the keyless entry, however, don't leave the car on and take the remote out too many times, soon it will tell you the key is missing even though its not.

Many compliments","On the preselected gear ration of the paddle shifts, 1,2,3 should be a little more defined it feels empty. 4,5,6 have oomph to them.

There was absolutely no traction from the tires and when I called the dealership, they suggested I get snow tires to the tune of $1300. They did offer to mount/balance them at a discount, however I was very disappointed.

I am averaging 27.5 mpg in a city/hwy mix while being rather aggressive with the throttle. Not as good as I could get with a smaller car but I am 6-4 300 lbs and I'm  comfortable in the Lancer.  The car has plenty of HP and torque.  I have found myself doing 90mph on the freeway without much effort. Getting around town is effortless.  At 6'4"" I actually have the drivers seat up a notch which surprised me.  The back seat provides enough room for 2 kids (1 in a car seat).  Seats are comfortable too.  The gauges are laid out well and the car performs all the functions that it should rather well.  I need more room to write the review","FAST Key-I love that my keys stay in my pocket.

The steering wheel controls rock too  Bluetooth is a must have for 5 speed owners  The car is rather zippy and always seems to be in the power curve.",Needs a 6th gear. Cruising on the freeway in 5th puts the motor at a higher RPM (2700-3500) than I would like for mileage but that is right in the power curve which mean no down shifting to pass but you are using more fuel than you would if you cruising at a lower RPM.

Features!,"Don't care for the wheels on any of the models. My biggest gripe is the cloth covered elbow rest in the front, the coarse black fabric shows everything on it!"
4.875,One thing missing,GC ,09/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"The 2008 Lancer GTS is almost where it needs to be. It looks the part, but if it had more juice it could play the part. I have owned several cars and looked at/drove several others prior to this purchase. Bottom line up front: you get your money's worth with this car. The ride is firm and balanced, not too harsh. It looks interesting both inside and out. It is on the verge of replacing the Honda Civic, Scion tC and Mazdaspeed3 as the next tuner favorite. The CVT is a pleasure to have along with the other tech-worthy toys inside. Mine is a daily driver, but will also be my hobby to add upgrades to. My intent is to find the hidden horsepower that Mitsubushi neglected to give the GTS.","18 inch wheels, Fosgate sound system, 7 in navigation system, HD music server, Sirius addition, seats, room, gorgeous looks and best of all the affordability of almost everything in one package.","More juice in the engine compartment, bigger brakes, quality interior, telescoping steering wheel, HID lights, better exhaust, iPod connectivity and a slightly lower stance."
4.875,Definitely built with consumer in mind!,AP in KS ,09/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I was in search for a car that I didn't expect to exist: sporty enough to meet my high standards but would work for a future family car. That is just what I found in the new 2008 Lancer! We added the Sun and Sound package which is really fun for summer driving! Talk about built with the consumer in mind! Everything about the car, from displays and gadgets to handling and mpg, this car meets every one of my needs and wants!! The bluetooth, steering wheel controls, and multi-dash display make for a very safe and forward facing drive. This car turns heads more than my Eclipse! I absolutely love to show this car off, inside and out!","Where do I begin... sporty exterior, roomy interior, and great standard options!",I'm being picky when I suggest that the info button should be added to the steering wheel controls so that you don't have to reach around. Thats it!
5,Features/great looks for not much $$ ,Mike ,09/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I recently picked out this car as we wanted to go from a two vehicle household down to one to save some money.  We sold her 07 Honda Fit and traded in my Nissan Armada towards the Lancer GTS w/ nav and tech package and sun and sound package.  Have not looked back since.  This car looks beautiful and turns lots of heads on the roadway.  For all the features you get (safety and tech-wise) you really can't beat it at all, not for the money anyway. Far too many Accords and Altimas out there, do yourself a favor and at least test drive the 08 Lancer GTS!",Navigation system (beats many aftermarket systems) with Music Server and Hands Free Bluetooth calling.  The exterior design looks far more like a BMW/Audi than it does a Kia/Scion. FASTKey is also a great feature... just keep your keys in your pocket or purse. Looks great in tarmac black!,"Just a tad bit more HP would have been wonderful (as many have noted), but there is enough there when you really need it.  Leather would have also been a nice option to go along with the tech and nav package."
4.75,I wanted a Mustang,Sarahzsmyl ,08/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I really wanted a 2007 Mustang, but I started comparing, and chose this one. I couldn't be happier.  I got an Electric Blue Lancer GTS with the nav system. The car runs smoothly, handles well, and looks great. With 18"" wheels, the ride can be a little rough, but that's ok. The car is gorgeous. I get looks where ever I go.  I've used three tanks so far and get good mpg, about 32 hwy and 26 city. The paddle shifters are fun, but prefer to use the stick to hold it into 2nd gear for acceleration. And so far, that's the only real draw back, it can be hard to get up to speed in auto-mode.  But, kick it into manual mode, and all that goes away. I don't regret my choice at all.","Rockford Fosgate stereo, sunroof, MMCS. Warranty.","A leather seating option would be nice. Better acceleration for CVT in manual mode. A few more horses. Lower the spoiler, it's right in you line of sight."

It has plenty of power to pass slower moving cars, has great design features and has tons of options that are standard.  This is a head turning car for sure!!  I like how it was built ready for after market performance upgrades as well.  Which are definately going on in the near future.  It handles great and I love the sound of the engine when you get the revs above 3500.

I got all the options including the navigation system, Sun and Sound package, and bluetooth.  This car is such an upgrade from my previous car (02 Chevy Malibu). It handles corners with a breeze, and its high speed pick up is very much unexpected.  My brother just bought a brand new Lexus IS 250, and my car has all the same options for less than half the price!  With a few performance upgrades coming in the near future, this car will be a fast, head-turning, teched out piece of automobile art!  Oh and by the way, it looks great in black!","Exterior styling.

The handling is very solid unlike my Civic, and does not float on the highway at all, the bluetooth and fast Key are a big plus.

Chose this over Scion tC and Honda Si because I love the sharp edges and corners of the Lancer, not to mention the extra room inside.  Went with the sun and sound package with the nav system. Everyone is intrigued by the FAST Key and stereo system.  Fun to drive in either automatic or with the paddle shifters.  I only wish there was some more power, but it is definitely sufficient.","Nav system, FAST key, sunroof, spoiler, 18"" wheels, interior room and CVT with paddle shifters.","Like everyone else has said, give it some more HP!!"
4.75,Great Car!!,Dan ,07/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,Love this car.  Ever since I saw this car I wanted it.  Funny thing is I couldn't afford it.  But when my old car was totaled.  This was the first car I went to see.  I just love the look of this car.  Everything about it is great. The gas mileage could be better but other than that its a great car.,Love the navigation and the fact you can store cds on the hard drive.  It's a lot safer when you're not changing cds while driving. Also the Rockford Fosgate sound system is just incredible.,Mainly just the gas mileage.

Looked at lots of cars (Scion xB, Kia Spectra 5, Honda Civic Si sedan, Saturn Aura, VW Rabbit) and just bought this one.  I love the looks and all the features.  I bought nav option with Music server. Still trying to figure it all out, but I really like it so far.  One thing: MP3 CDs will not store in the MusicServer, but WAV files will store, you just have to type in the names of the track yourself.

The electric blue is amazing, it was the very first thing that made me want to look at the car. With the keys in hand I took a 50 mile test drive. The handling of the car was great, almost like my BMW. It is heavy and stays on the road. The sound system is awesome along with the bluetooth, all the info screens and the FAST key - love that I no longer need a key.

5,Lancer GTS looks like twice the price,Geodude ,07/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The Lancer GTS is a lot of bang for the buck! I looked at cars in the same class as well as some upscale makes in the same size. Hands down this car is the best value and absolutely the best looking including cars costing much more money. I've never had so many compliments at stop lights and convenience stores. Mitsubishi may well be on their way to moving up the sales  ladder with this fantastic car with Japanese reliability!,"Navigation, blue tooth, 30 gig hard drive to download ALL my music to, Looks, looks, looks!",Tad more power.

Handles great, stereo system is awesome (Rockford), lots of features for your money.  You do hear a lot of road noise and engine noise.  I think they need a quieter engine.  It sounds like it's knocking.  They took away from the quality of the interior for all of the electronic features.  I love this car, though, it's fun to drive.  As far as power I thinks it performs well. I was doing 60 from traffic light to traffic light without realizing it.

Automatic climate control, bluetooth, and having everything on the steering wheel.","Better quality interior such as the seats, door panels.  Lighted mirrors.  Auto day/night mirror.

4.5,I like this car,Tom in Vegas ,06/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"I was set on buying a Mazda6 until I stumbled upon this car. What I like the most is the comfort inside. It's got lots of room and the seats are comfortable. I really like the radio controls on the steering wheel, they are very convenient. I got a better price and got more than I would have with the 6.

The Bluetooth and sound system are awesome.  Sirius radio works flawlessly.  The CVT is amazing.  Safety features abound.  This car is perfect for weekday commuting and weekend getaways!

You get a lot of car for your money.  Some decent factory equipment (unfortunately mine didn't come with the nav system). Surprisingly comfortable for a small car with a driver who's 6'2 (3 inches of head room).  The new exterior redesign is just awesome.  Really a fun car to drive.  The only real complaint I have is that this car could use more horses.  ","Suspension and handling, exterior looks, stereo, safety features, interior layout and room.",This car screams for more HP.

The GPS navigation is easy to use, the Bluetooth is a great convenience, the 18 inch wheels give this car a fantastic look. I just wish this car, the GTS variant that is, was given more power and I do agree with another reviewer that it should be about 10-20 more horses. Despite that, the car handles greatly thanks to a solid chassis that also is begging for more power. Honestly, with the Electric Blue Pearl color, I am also getting thumbs up everywhere I go.

It handles great, firm and sporty but not harsh, with precise steering and excellent balance with little hint of over or understeer even hard into a curve.  Fit and finish on the exterior is excellent, same on the interior (I question the carpet and 'crushed velvet' lint brush interior cloth).  The NAV system is precise, the stereo very good with lots of power but decent clarity.  Mileage so far is great too.  The MT/Paddle CVT setup is actually pretty good, but almost demands you manage it manually if you want a sporty drive. Definitely could use more HP, 10-20 more.",Stereo and Nav system are class leading.  Excellent safety features.  Surefooted handling and smooth/sporty ride.  Precise steering. Exceptional looks.,"Carpet quality on the interior needs to be improved.  Leather option, not aftermarket or dealer add on, needed.  MORE POWER... the GTS should have gotten 10-20 more HP.

Compared to my 2003 Galant ES, this car is a generation better in technology. However, the Galant is better (fun and comfort) to drive and has better fuel economy. Having said that, this car holds its own in terms of performance and comfort. The interior is basic. Cheap looking/feeling fabrics and hard edged plastics. Not a lot of amenities such as an additional power outlet (option), covered storage, arm rests, seat adjustments (has fore/aft & back tilt), coin holder, etc. I have to step back and tell myself that I purchased this car as a beater to drive to work.",Power - this car tackles tall hills in overdrive without much effort. It easily accelerates for passing (in OD). The suspension smooths the trails and sticks to the corners like velcro.,"The speedo and RPM gauges need to be swapped in placement because the business ends are spread too far apart. The steering wheel placement is too far forward for my 5'11"" frame and strains my arms. The audio system is superb but it rattles the panels too easily. The gearing needs to be fine tuned."

I've driven quite a few cars, and I must say, this is the most impressive part of this car!  Word is, it's fairly close to the suspension that will be found in the EVO-X.  This car has more available features than any car in it's class (I got them all).  The Multi-Communication / Navigation / Sound package is something you'd expect out of a $100k luxury sedan.  Looks!

I am a red guy, so I saw the commercials with the Rally Red Metallic paint job and I fell in love with the car.  I needed the Sun and Sound Package for sure.  The navigation was a little too expensive for me, but the car is great without it.  Within a week of looking at them, I bought one.  I have the only Rally Red Metallic GTS CVT with the Sun and sound package that was available in the state.  It was very hard to find, but the salesman did a great job at getting it for me.

Everything from styling to creature comforts has helped raise the bar for this class of sedan. The car is a joy to drive, and the paddle shifters for the CVT transmission on the GTS model allow you to keep the engine in its sweet spot while carving through tight corners. The car is built tight with no squeaks or rattles of any kind. The optional 650 watt Rockford Fosgate audio system packs a punch, especially with the included subwoofer.

Needless to say I went home that night with the car.  And it has been breaking necks every since.  This car is pound for pound untouchable by Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, ScionTC, Chevy Colbalt, Acura NSX. ",I must say the Titanium Paddle Shifters make the 2.0L 4cyl sing of a mid-engine car.
