5,Own.  Purchased with 3K miles in 2008 at dealer.,Stonebank ,10/09/2016,5,4,5,,,5,5,5,4,,,"Maintaining this vehicle is not cheap, but doing the preventive maintenance is a lot cheaper.  Having a four wheel drive vehicle gives you two differentials to maintain instead of one plus the transfer case.  I have run nothing but Mobil I oil in it, and perform the recommended mechanical work earlier than recommended using the best material possible.  My vehicle looks new, and runs like a well tuned watch even with 157,000 miles.  I have my own maintenance schedule that has kept every car I have owned in great shape for many years with hardly a breakdown (which I blame on ethanol).  Change hoses every three years with a coolant flush, change the battery every three years with the best you can buy, replace any potential defective wiring as noticed, and change oil every 5-7000 miles running only synthetic regardless of climate.  Replace all brakes before damaging rotors, and ensure the rotors are the best duty you can keep on the car, rotate tires with every oil change, and put the best tires on the vehicle possible.  A few extra bucks here can save thousands.  Update mechanicals as noted by a GOOD mechanic.  I use a high quality dealership, and the repair prices are not really any higher, and the mechanics are well trained and supervised.  My only real comfort negative is short seats which is common in most cars these days.  I have long legs and lack of proper thigh support creates a painful butt and hamstrings on longer rides.  My car has performed pretty much flawlessly.",,
5,why don't they build this anymore?,russ weaver ,04/25/2016,4,4,5,,,5,4,5,5,,,This vehicle is a mid size suv on a solid full frame. Handles rough terrain and freeway speeds equally well. I'd buy a new one if I could.,,

5,ENVOY SLT  Solid as Stone Mountain,Bill Poindexter ,07/08/2015,5,4,5,,,5,5,5,4,,,"We purchased our 2008 GMC Envoy SLT with 10,000 miles on it and one year old.  Now we have over 150,000 on it and would not trade it for anything new and free.  The best way to describe the old school, body on frame, straight six SUV is SOLID.  For work I have the opportunity to rent many vehicles and nothing comes close to the solid feel and stump pulling power of GM's Envoy and Trail blazer twin.  My brother in law is a master mechanic and shop owner and rather than purchase a new vehicle (which he could easily afford)  he chose a well cared for Trail Blazer.  He is highly impressed with the bullet proof power train rugged body on frame design.  I can attest it feels like you are driving a SUBSTANTIAL vehicle.  The mass of power available at the slightest touch of the gas verifies what I read.  The truck engine in these SUVs were over built by GM.  The solid axil always stays put and signals when you are adrift in the lane resulting in a reassuring ride and stable tracking regardless of the highway condition.  Newer vehicle designs may give you more storage pockets and cup holders but I value solid construction and indestructible power train as more important for getting you from A to B.  Comfort is exceptionable and everything is quiet and solid inside the car.  Repairs have been limited to a cracked exhaust manifold and wires chewed up by a demented squirrel.  I would strongly lean toward buying a well cared for Envoy over a new vehicle just because they simply don't build them like this any more.",,
3.75,2008 Envoy Winter Driver,phoenixiv ,02/26/2015,,,3,4,4,4,,4,4,4,3,"Just bought the wife a winter driver because the Toyota Corolla Sport can't even make it out of the driveway if it has 2 inches of snow or more. The Envoy is stable, dependable and with automatic or full time 4 wheel drive it plows through snow and ice covered roads well. Most of the time it turns around in the drive with 5-6 inches of fresh snow without 4 wheel drive engaged. The vehicle has a smooth heavy feel on the highway more like a 1/2 ton truck which we both like but it has a softer ride. Great leg room for me for a change which fits my 6' 1"" frame better than most of the smaller crossovers or SUVs. The 4.2L inline six has good power and torque at both low and high speeds.",Automatic 4 wheel drive is nice and the stability control work well together. I actually think I can get to the spark plugs without pulling the engine which is really nice for a change.,Turbocharged inline six might be nice for both power and economy or maybe a small diesel.

Monthly payment was getting to much so had to downsize to a small car again, but looking forward to being back in a FORD Focus again.  Anyone who has mentioned the seats don't fold down flat, WELL THEY DO.  We didn't think so at first either until my husband went out one day and figured it out, reading the manual really helped too.

4.125,Love the Denali but not the Mileage,vallywally ,11/09/2009,,,3,5,5,5,,5,5,1,4,"Hwy mpg is OK but city mpg is very poor. The seat belt cuts into my neck and needs to be repositioned. Denali exterior is an eye turner but the plastic ""woodgrain"" console looks cheap and tacky. Seats are comfortable but would prefer a softer leather. When I'm stopped for a light, after 10+ seconds there's a thud-like jolt & sound from under the car. Dealer has no idea what is causing this but has heard others complain about it. ","Exterior Denali styling is terrific. Smooth ride, great turning radius, easy to drive, on-board compressor, integrated hitch, running boards.","#1 - Need better city mileage!!  Seat belts that don't give me a neck rash, integrated holder for cell phone, pull out door pockets or better designed console that can hold a small handbag, rear seats should fold flat like they did in my old Blazer (loved that feature & fold down gate in the Blazer)"
2.75,Good power but that's where the good end,Milez5858 ,10/21/2009,,,3,3,2,3,,4,3,1,3,"I bought the Envoy as the most powerful 6 cylendar for towing. I turns out I get better milage with an 8 cylendar truck. The air shocks were constantly pumping up, the fans for the climate control extremely loud, there is no vent setting so it was either blowing hot or cold air, wind noise was excessive, the gas tank is configured such that it always spilled over when filling no matter what gas station I went to. Passing gear was great but taking of from stopped was very slow for a 280 hp engine.",6200 lbs towing was great for a 6 banger mid sized SUV. That was offset by only getting 15 MPG. I get nearly 20 in my Dodge Ram.,"Use quiet fans on the climate control and add a pass through vent feature. Gas milage must be improved. Ditch the air suspension in the back, it is just one more thing to break. Impove door seals for wind noise reduction. Change the rear gear ratio so there is some excelleration."
3,2008 envoy,alc13 ,07/22/2009,,,1,5,2,3,,3,5,1,4,"Not sure if I have the SLE or SLT. I rated the gas milage poor because it is extremely inconsistant. I travel 6 hrs interstate/highway time per week and I go the same speed every time.  Some trips I go through a little over a 1/4 and sometimes I go through a whole tank. Thats a huge difference! Also, it should get better milage than a truck 17mpg just doesn't cut it for its size. I rated the interior design poorly also because there is only one cup holder, back seats don't really fold down, console is tiny, and the computer system randomly turns on and off the change oil light.  As far as build quality stuff I had to have the powertrain completely replaced when I first bought it.",Comfortable and easy to manuever,"Put in more than one cup holder so the passenger has a place to put their drink.

I would agree with some that turning is very soft with this vehicle, but some like the smoothness that it gives you. I have yet to tow something with it, but can't wait.

Very pleased with the pricing and is an excellent family SUV. The 8 cylinder gives it more power and does not really effect the gas mileage. Much better than the 6 cylinder in our last one.,8 cylinder engine and its ability to run on 4 cylinders. XM radio is outstanding as well as the Bose sound system.,Seat belts are not the easiest to access. We did not get the nav because it is not user friendly that should be updated.

Yes, there is a learning curve, but once you are proficient it works fine! Save for the XM traffic report - it does not have. I have owned previous Nav systems with this feature and it is great! We get comments all the time on how wonderful the vehicle looks - it looks like GM hit the mark on this vehicle. My wife drives is the primary driver and she absolutely loves this car over the Saturn ION we traded for it. Yes, the gas mileage went down with the trade, but the ride and the sense of feeling safe in a larger vehicle was worth the trade-off!",Interior trim and handling.

It is all that I can do to figure this thing out, my wife gave up after several very frusterating attempts. Save the money and buy a garmin!
