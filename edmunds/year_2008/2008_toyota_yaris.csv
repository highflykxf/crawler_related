5,Feels like it was just built at 108k,Calvin Luchs ,05/19/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,4,5,,,"A hand full of these had intermittent water pump failure. this was pretty rare, but if you're looking used inspect near the water pump for pink crust, it's a dead give away. That out of the way, I am a regular sized college student. I got this to be reliable, hearty, and get good fuel economy. I have slammed 15000 miles on it in the year I've owned it, and It has had literally nothing wrong. No squeaks, rattles, nothing. I put oil in it. That is it. If you're a guy living in america, your buddies may jag you off about this car at first but the fact of the matter is I drove to my friends house to help him fix his Lincoln in my little Toyota. Another friend with a jeep attempted to join us but his car caught fire. You will outlast anything but perhaps old Honda motorcycles with this car. For some anecdotal stuff:-I have driven in one pittsburgh winter and with half life all seasons I had no trouble getting up steep, 4 to 5 inch deep snow packed gradients. AWD cop cars were sliding down the hill past me, but the yaris kept on going. -I put my girlfriend, her dog and it's crate, and a week and a half worth of food in the back (Seats down) and drove 790 miles to Maryland and averaged 39 mpg doing it. coming back i actually got 42. On a straight highway drive at 60 miles per hour i can actually get 49 mpg reliably, with the 5 speed manual. -I learned to drive stick in this car, and even with me buggering the clutch repeatedly while learning, The shifts are quick and easy, and the clutch is a little on the tighter side when new, but it wears nicely and lasts a long time. There is nothing difficult about working on this car, and usually i don't need to jack it up for routine maintenance because it sits rather high on it's wheels, which also gives good visibility. The suspension isn't sophisticated, but it works pretty well, and the seats are awesome. You can take some pretty serious bumps without suffering in this car. Had one minor accident, sun got in my eyes and I lost sight of the road and at about 15 miles an hour slammed into a lady in a big old saturn station wagon. No damage whatsoever. Tires are cheap as dirt, and so is just about everything else for this car. Overall I love it. and If you're worried your more ""Merica"" friends will give you garbage, they probably will, but by the time their dodge has eaten it's 9th transmission in 45k miles, they'll come to love the car of the person who's repeatedly bailed them out and helped keep their scrap on the road :) Comfy, reliable, cheap and easy to fix and run, and everything is bolted together to a german- like standard of build quality, with a toyota- like standard of precision and engineering. Fantastic car.",,

This is a commuter car that is very basic and great on gas. It cost me around $25 to fill up and that last me for weeks. It sits a little lower to the ground so getting in and out is easier. I've had this car for over five years and the only maintenance I've done to 1. Replace timing belt ($20) and 2. Replace the battery ($110). I'd like to make not here that the original manufacturers battery from 06/2008 lasted me until 09/2015 which is terrific, it was a Panasonic battery too. I've driven to car both city and highway and talk about low maintenance. My only complain is there's not enough power to it, perhaps the manual version might be a little quicker but there have been times where I've floored it, and it took a while for transmission to kick in. Also, I've had problems with visibility and seeing out of the windshield and behind me. I've driven it in all sorts of terrain, it does pretty good in the snow with all weather tires and does great in the rain. The interior is basic but it does have a few perks like MP3 port where I plug in my I phone. My 2008 has $70,000 miles and it's still going strong, no surprise though after 70k miles I had to change the battery though. If you're on a budget and want a reliable vehicle that's great on gas, this car is great for you.",,

Just routine  things like oil changes and tires. Replaced the belt at 150,000 miles. It has a timing chain, not a belt so as long as you change the oil on schedule that will never be a problem.My Mechanic says its in excellent shape, it will last me several more years.  I am retired, so I drive it on vacations a lot, it has been in 45 of the lower 48 states. Engine is amazing for a 1.5 I regularly cruise at 80 to 85, and you dont even feel it. Regularly gets 40 mpg combined. Only thing I do not have that I should have gotten is cruise control, and you can get one with it. Great little car, was only 13,000 brand new.

I bought this car brand new November of 2008.  I love this car.  For the price, this vehicle can't be beat.  I consistently get around 40 mpg and that includes stop and go traffic.  I'm also just over 142,000 miles with only replacing the serpentine belt and standard oil changes.  I'm still using the original brakes and clutch.  The paint is still in excellent condition and the interior still looks great.  For a base model, no bells and whistles, great for everyday use, with great reliability, you can't get anything better.

Reliability is bulletproof, low maintenance costs, drives like it is a bigger car. With the right tires (Michelin Defender) the drive is very smooth and quiet. Fuel economy is exceptional. Peppy for an auto with only a 1.5 engine. Surprisingly good room in the back and front seats. The seats are quite comfortable and supportive. Only negative is the small cargo area in the hatchback.

For $13,500 there is no way I could have gotten a better new car than this.  It is fun to drive (had a 00 Volvo before this) and you get great gas mileage. Makes great U-turns and I can actually parallel park with this car. As far as built quality, well that is where it really could do better. Too much cheap plastic and the inside cloth on the driver's door is fading for some reason.  As far as reliability goes, I see it lasting forever.  I've put 17K miles on it and have done only the oil changes.","Cup holders, cute looks, roomy, Aux input, seats high up, cool looking dashboard at night, fun to drive, no blind spots.","The outside is already dented in 3 places just from shopping carts at the parking lot, you feel every small rock on the road, very noisy inside, when turning air on it smells disgusting, original tires are dangerous in the water (mine has slipped)."
4,It's good enough so far,Duder ,10/23/2010,,,4,4,2,5,,4,4,5,4,I bought the little hatch back because I needed it's versatility and high fuel economy. The seat isn't exactly comfortable but supports my back better than the competition. I like it's French Styling with it's typical center mounted speedometer. All the storage bins are great and so is the extensible sun visor. The optional arm rest is well positioned for me and I like that the center console doesn't rob knee room. The thing that irritates me the most are all the rattles and vibrations that come and go. The good side of this annoyance is that it keeps me just irritated enough on long trips to keep me wide awake. In this respect the rattles add to the safety of the car.,Economy and maneuverability and funny looks.,Placing a digital speedometer display in front of the driver just below the windshield and putting a storage bin where the speedometer currently is. Clean up the front nose a little and add telescopic steering like the ones sold in the UK have.
5,This car deserves better press!,Jon ,10/23/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"A great, well-designed little car. Very comfortable for me (I'm 6'2"", 220#) with more headroom than my Dad's minivan and more knee room than my friend's Mazda 3. As a tall person who usually finds the steering wheel partially blocking the speedometer, I actually found the center-mount speedo an improvement. Have driven the car through Wyoming blizzards and ugly urban commutes and found it pleasant, sturdy and nimble. It also holds a lot, like me, my 2-man crew, 2 tool boxes, & 25 gallons of paint (never thought the Yaris would muscle in on my pick-up!). Best mileage I've had was 42mpg on a run between S.F. and Reno. The worst was 25 mpg in urban stop & go commuting (using no freeways at all).","Had no idea the car would be so much fun to drive. Super-responsive steering and quick acceleration in the 0-50mph range (much like a Mini or Jetta). The engine can dog a bit on sustained climbs at highways speeds, but nothing as bad as the Hyundais or Ford Focuses I've driven in similar conditions.","The main issue with the Yaris cockpit design is visibility--the A-pillars to the left and right of the windshield eat a lot of space, and frequently block the turn signals of vehicles around you in multi-lane environments like freeways. Can also create a blind spot for pedestrians in crosswalks."

That's the AVERAGE! It's helping to make the payments with the money that I'm saving. It's cute, fun to drive. If I had to list a negative, I'd say the light gas pedal won't support the weight of my foot and you notice it on a long trip if you don't have cruise control.

Also great in the snow with the skinny tires.  This car shines as commuter car.  It has plenty of go and decent handling.  That is noticeably reduced with two passengers or heavy cargo.

Even though car was loaded, Toyota found ways to unnecessarily cheapen the design.  Middle position instrument cluster is the first tip off. Intermittent wipers are not speed- adjustable. Even the pedal spacing  spacing is parsimonious. The dealer- option speed control stalk is invisible from the driver's position. A height adjustable drivers seat is not an option, nor was satellite radio.

I bought this car for gas mileage and was expecting it to be a compromise in other ways but IT IS NOT!  I consistently get 29 to 32 MPG without trying to maximize fuel economy and have gotten 42 on one road trip. The size of this car is deceiving and there is plenty of room inside.

The ABS was a godsend in those storms too.  I love how solid and roomy it feels for an economy car.

Got it with about 31k miles, and only 1 owner before me.  Paid $8950.  To me that's a crazy good deal.  Build quality is excellent. Reputation for reliability is basically bulletproof.  Gas mileage is great, especially if you don't drive it hard.  Drives, handles, shifts, and brakes very well for an economy car.

4.25,Great Buy For the Money,PG ,12/24/2009,,,5,3,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"I own a 2008 Toyota Yaris Sedan with 62K on it and has been very reliable thus far. I purchased the Yaris when fuel went up to $4.00+ per gallon. Overall, it has exceeded my expectations in regards to reliability and value.  This vehicle averages anywhere from 32-34 MPG per tank with normal city/hwy driving. The MPG does drop a bit in colder weather due to fuel additives put into the gas, you'll lose around 1-2MPG. If you're doing strictly HWY driving, this model will allow you to drive 370-385 miles per tank before re-filling. The return is 37-38.5 MPG, before the fuel light flashes quickly meaning you have 1.1 gallons of fuel available.","Fuel economy, Auxiliary Jack (IPOD) Reliability, Great Value, Easy to drive.","The body of the vehicle is prone to paint chipping on the HWY.  Not sure how Toyota can improve this. The seats are comfortable, but they stain easily. Purchase the Yaris  with the darker interior, dark exterior.  My vehicle is Polar white, with the light interior option. It is difficult to clean. "

Zippy and fun to drive around town, but not a great ride on the freeway (the car is very light and doesn't seem to hug the road well at high speeds).  Definitely go for the manual - you'll get a lot more juice out of it AND better gas mileage.  I test drove the automatic, and it was sluggish.  The base car comes pretty stripped of amenities, but that's probably why the car is so low priced. I put a simple spoiler on mine, and I think it really helps the style.

5,Close to Perfection,Joe ,09/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The longer I have this car, the more I love it. As much or more than anything it is just plain fun to drive. It handles like a go kart around the corners. It gets around 35+ mpg in town. I love the 2 door hatchback because the doors are longer than they are on a 4 door and easier to get in and out of. It is short enough to walk around to the hatch to put things in very easily, especially with the flat floor. If you want cruise, make sure to get if from the factory, as an aftermarket unit is clumsy to reach and it is more expensive since the car is not pre-wired for it like most other vehicles.","Handling is great. Gas Mileage is great. Most fun car to drive. Super easy access to rear cargo area. Turns around in very small spaces, very maneuverable. Did I mention how fun it is to drive?!! Easy to wash and wax. Neat looking car!! I love this car!!","It might be nice to have the rear hatch window go down for quiet ventilation. The steering should adjust in and out. The stock tires are fine for summer but worthless in the snow, get Michelin Harmony's if you live where it snows. Put cruise on all of them at the factory."

Very reliable car, no engine issues, manual is almost... fun sometimes. Air works well, and stereo is not bad. Only issues I've had are the easily scratched panels, very annoying... also the panels where seat belts are get gauged. My Camry had a more resilient interior. Gas mileage is excellent, best I got was 360 miles to one tank on the hwy, and for an 11 gallon tank, that ain't too shabby. The exterior damages way too easily also. Bumpers on this car are horrible and expensive to repair, try not to back into anything, its going to be over 500 to fix.

I am on the road a lot for work (both hwy and city), so when purchasing a car last year, my main concern was reliability and gas mileage. When I first purchased the Yaris, it got around 36 mpg, but now that it is broken in I have gotten up to 41 mpg. I am very pleased with my purchase, and would recommend the Yaris for anyone wanting an economical car to zip around town in.","mpg, comfortable and roomy, reliability",The cup holders are in front of the heat and air vents. 
4.5,Why rate the milage so high?,Rob ,08/25/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"I'm not sure why everyone rates the mileage so high. This is a 1.5l 4 cyl engine that should get at least 35 mpg in mixed driving and 40-45 for highway cruising (50-55 mph). I have been very disappointed that in 50% highway driving at reasonable speeds I can only get 30 mpg when going downhill with a tailwind. Otherwise I'm happy with my Toyota.  I'm 6'2"" and have plenty of headroom and decent legroom. No problem loading the family of 4 (2 car seats) with all the necessary gear in the spacious trunk to head out for the weekend.

He LOVES the car and uses it on weekdays and I get to use it on weekends.  Mileage average is 30MPG with mostly short trips.  Plenty of trunk room.  My other car is an 08 Camry Hybrid and while the ride/performance are not in that league, the Yaris is a competent, safe performer.  Radio reception is weak and it's hard to read the LCD screen for the radio settings - the CD sounds adequate.  If you drive conservatively and like to get good MPG - this is a great car for you.  ","The doors have the most solid feeling when they are closed of any car I've ever owned. The power windows are quiet/quick.  Tight build quality, no problem getting used to center gauges, excellent steering feel, cold AC and adequate headroom for this 6 foot 250# driver. Much quieter than expected.

BUT there are some issues that I wish I had known about before purchase. They are significant enough that I may have chosen another vehicle. 1. You cannot drive with the windows open because of a strange sound effect that hurts your ears. 2. The sounds system is TERRIBLE. 3.Cup holders in TERRIBLE places. 4. Air smells like dirty feet when you turn it on. On last oil change they found NO cabin air filter. 5. Just plain too small. My teens cannot sit in the back seat so we have to take TWO cars on trips.

The same day, I drove home in my Yaris. From my studies, I severely underestimated this car. I love it to death. I get more than double the gas mileage and I'm hoping that the reliability will be on par with my grandmother's '96 Camry, which has NEVER been in shop for anything but wear and tear.

But the interior is so well designed, with many cup-holders, compartments and the hatchback, that I feel as comfortable in it as I did in my 4Runner SUV. It's been years since I had a hatchback, and the accessibility is a wonderful convenience. I have a manual and know how to drive it efficiently. I get between 36-45 mpg, depending on whether the gas station sells 100% gas or an ethanol blend. Can reach anything from the driver's seat except the very back (trunk) part of hatchback. Gets in any parking space. Never had such a convenient, easy access car.","I have so many compartments and holders, and with the hatchback I have real convenience & easy access everywhere.

There is nothing fancy or luxurious about this car, and if you rely on your car to impress your fellow man, this is not for you. But, if your desire is to have affordable, economical, and reliable transportation, image be damned, then you want a Toyota Yaris. This car just keeps running, requiring only gasoline and the 5K mile routine maintenance (oil change, tire pressure check, etc. This is an excellent car and I heartily recommend it to anyone who asks.

Although, I'm a very conservative driver, I am getting upwards of 800 kilometres on a single tank!  The manual transmission is exceptionally smooth and seems to be a helpful tool during inclement weather. Exterior design is beautiful, perhaps a bit of a head turner, but the interior location of the centre mounted instrument cluster took some getting use to.  I wish that cruise control was a factory option as I spend a lot of time on the highway.

I drive this in a mountainous area of Canada which has the highest snow fall in Canada, most years anyway. So it is December and the studded tires are on and the car seems to be fairing quite well. A little noise from the studs but not as much as I thought there would be from a small car. The first gear is a little spongy but actually works well in limiting wheel spin in slippery situations. Other than that, not much wrong with this econ-o-box.","The fuel mileage. With the adequate ground clearance it seems to handle well in the snow, which is why I didn't buy the Civic. My friend gets stuck in her Civic, even with studded tires, to low to the ground. I suspect you will see lots of these in Colorado. I live in a very similar place.","The transmission is a bit whiny, maybe a heavier fluid will help and the gear ratios could be looked at for some fine tuning.

It is SO roomy inside, more roomy than my Civic, and drives very smooth. The body seems solid on the interstate and it hugs the roadway. I was surprised to find how high it sits. There have been many times when I am sitting at a red light and a crossover or SUV pulls up next to me and I am eye level with the driver, and I'm only 5'4"". It makes me feel much safer. ","Body style, perfect size for student and passenger, design, ride quality, height. ","The plastic interior does seem to scuff easily, but it is wiped away very simply with some armor-all or a wet wipe. The back windshield (I think) rattles when I go certain speeds, but it may just be my storage container in the trunk. "
4.75,I love my Yaris,Peggy ,10/01/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I did research before getting this car.  Got it yesterday and love it, love it, love it.  It is like driving a sports car.  I had a lot of errands to run and the gas gauge barely moved.  It is zippy, picks up speed on the highway nicely.  It is great fun!","Handling, gas mileage, appearance.",don't know of any yet
5,Great Little Car,Andy ,09/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I am amazed about this car. I wanted good gas mileage and this car delivers! Great performance for the engine it has. It maneuvers really good. The Yaris gets in places that my Dodge Caravan could never go. I got the convenience package with a great audio system and 15 inch wheels. I am very satisfied with the Yaris!!,I am 6 foot and the Yaris has lots of legroom for me. It handles great. Comfortable. Lots of spaces to place things. ,None whatsoever.

I compared the Chev Aveo, the Smart car and a small Kia.  I felt the Toyota Yaris would meet my needs and I have not been disappointed. The mpg is very good above advertised. The car is comfortable, fun and easy to drive. For a small 2 door hatchback it has a surprising amount interior room. With the rear 60-40 rear seat down it has a great cargo space in the back.  I added a few options for comfort and appearance. As with any small car it sways on the highway in high crosswinds. Overall I am very pleased with this car. It does cost a little more than similar.","My Yaris has auto trans and the power package with electric windows, good radio and rear wiper with heated glass. I like the standard features that come with the base model. High mileage was my reason for buying this car. All Yaris' have a great 1.5 L engine with 4 valves per cyl and VVT.",I was disappointed that the Yaris is in short supply and it is hard to find what you want on this car. The Toyota web site says that the car comes with quite a few options. You cannot order a car from the factory with your desired features. You must take what comes off the truck carrier. Bummer.

My explorer was only 2 years old, but the gas prices were killing me and it was just too big. I enjoy driving now. I never have any backseat passengers anyway, so i put the backseats down and it's like a mini-suv. I even fit a desk and chair back there. I love all the cubby and stash places. I don't like things loose in my car. The doors are big it's alot easier to get in and out than I thought it would be. Didn't realize it tells you what gear you are in on the computer screen. Mom drove it in 3rd. Now we got it figured out. It has a great turn radius so 3 point turns are a cinchOutside. They put a lot of thought into this little car!","All the gloveboxes and cubbies.

4.875,Awesome little car!,Jen ,09/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,I bought this car when ending my senior year in high school. I was looking to get a fuel-friendly affordable car and I got just that! I recently brought the car to NH and I was averaging 45 mpg  on the highway. The car is big enough inside where I don't feel cramped and it is usually the car my friends and I take to the beach because it's great on gas and the trunk is huge. (My cousin and I can both fit in the trunk together!) The car can definitely hold its own on the highway and definitely makes for a comfortable ride. I would highly recommend this car! I love my Betty Boop =),The speedometer in the center took getting used to but I tend to see how fast I am driving now. The placement of the cup holders is also different but definitely works. ,"For being affordable and great on gas I can't complain much, but the car does seem to lack highway pickup when comparing to my old 97' honda civic.

On the good side I average about 34 MPG with around 70/30 city/highway. Another plus is the design, cute and well made. Unfortunately, the car has quite a few downs... such as the acceleration. It truly feels economy car like. If you really want any type of hustle from this car, you need to darn near floor it. It is also not that great to drive. The small thin wheels and comfort tuned cheap suspension don't make for very exciting backroads adventures. It is decently comfortable for front passengers and has a reasonable amount of space in back. But that driving position is just weird.

There is no front seat console unfortunately, but I found a website where I can get an aftermarket one that will fit my little car. I got the hatchback SPORT edition, and although that wasn't what I initially set out for, I'm so glad I got it! It's so fun, and people are always smiling at it and saying things like ""sweet""! The hatchback is great for a single person like me, or just a couple, but if you have kids, the hatchback really isn't as practical as the sedan would be. This car has a lot of pick-up and power, it can climb steep hills with the best of them, especially with that 3rd gear.","It's so spacious inside, the passing 3rd gear is awesome and fun and easy to use, and it really gives the car extra power when you need to pass. MPG! I love the extra glove boxes on the drivers and passengers side of the dash board. It's a breeze to park and get out of tight spaces too.","A center console with storage and a fold out cupholder that could easily replace the existing cupholder between the 2 front seats. At least offer Cruise control in this car! A choice of interiors would also be nice, tan is a nicer option than black for hot locations."
4.625,Loving the fuel mileage,Brian Young ,08/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,4,My wife and I really enjoy our Yaris S 5-speed. The lowest mileage we've gotten is 44 and the highest almost 49. Have driven it nearly 7000 troublefree miles and are impressed with the ride and quietness for such a small relatively inexpensive car. There is plenty of passenger room and the trunk is amazingly large.,Wife likes the center gauges - on all our previous cars she has had difficulty seeing the gauges through the steering wheel because she has to have the seat as far forward as it will go.,Auto headlamps would be nice and trunk release needs to be added to the remote.
4.875,Fun little car,Buddy ,08/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I traded in my Ford Excursion for this little car.  After driving a monster SUV, I find this car to be nimble and quick. It's the only cheap car that a 6'2"" man can slip in and out of easily. It's noisy on the freeway but handles well enough that I don't feel I'm in a death trap. I drive on Houston's busy interstate system, even in the rain and my lil' Yaris holds its own which really surprised me! I miss my monster SUV, but hey, get over it! I'm averaging 41 mpg which is almost 4 times better than my Excursion with it guzzling V10 engine. I've gotten lots of compliments and questions from strangers. This car will pay for itself in gas alone. I don't like the ""cute car"" comments though.","Comfortable for a cheap car and GREAT gas mpg. Interior is ""different"" with speedometer in the center but I like the extra glove box behind the steering wheel. It helps make my economy car seem a little different than the rest of the cars in its class.  ",My hatchback has a funny feeling automatic transmission when I'm on the interstate. It slows down pretty fast if I let off the gas petal at 65 mph. The gas and brake petals are too close for a man with a size 14 shoe.

This car is not a Camry, but rides remarkably well for a small car.  I was surprised at the noise level in the car.  I was expecting very noisy, but find the sound level to be tolerable.  I have achieved 45 mpg on the highway which is amazing.  The car is rated for 37 highway, but I have run thru 2 tanks of gas and registered 44 & 45 mpg.  The only secret to my success is driving no faster than 60 mph.  The car is quiet enough at that speed and it is also the sweet spot for MPG.  If you want great MPG drive this car gently and you won't be disappointed",MPG - A/C works great. Seat is ok on comfort.  Power windows and door locks. Inside space is large for such a small car.

Manual transmission/engine is zippy.  Fit and finish is excellent.  Nice trunk size.,"I like the center guages, but would love to see toyota put a holograph on the windshield (in front of the driver) with just the speedometer read out.

We went almost 100 miles before it moved from the full mark. We've driven almost 200 miles now and still have 3/4 of a tank of gas. Handling is great, and it has a tire pressure monitoring system. Controls are laid out logically and are easy to operate. Air conditioning will put icicles on your nose! The center gauges are different and take a little time to get accustomed to, but are nice.

I have a heavy foot and my daughter found that she was driving around in 3rd instead of Drive.  Very roomy feel in the drivers seat.

However, in the month and a half I've had it, it's now been in the shop twice. When the car was 3 weeks old the keyless entry stopped working.

I've been outstandingly happy with my Yaris.  I average 38 mpg (mixed driving, both city and highway) and have a record of 41 mpg.  While not the Yaris is not the quickest accelerator, I do not feel out of pace on the freeway. Not recommended for tall consumers. I am 5'5"" and feel that this is the perfect sized car for me.  The Corolla feels slightly too big, for comparison.  The center gauges do not take long to get used to, and are not as distracting as you would think.

I regularly get stopped by people who are curious about the car and I tell them all the same thing . . . BUY IT!  I was a little concerned when I first bought it regarding the size.

5,I Love my new Yaris,Deca ,06/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This little Yaris is the coolest car on the planet. I just am amazed with it. People look at me more than when i drove my Xterra . The gas mileage is awesome. My only concern is how this car will take the winter and sleet/snow. The S package does come with bigger tires so you do lose some gas mileage but the handling is better. The AC is great. The interior room is plenty. I do give Toyota lots of credit for making a peppy 1.5 16 valve . The Yaris should pass every test possible that my BF will put it through. I look forward to the east coast winter and see if it really is all that. Oh I did add my own GPS and Sirius and tinted the glass. Let's rock this Yaris.,I love the colors Toyota offers. Mine is blue as the review. The ability to park in nyc anywere is the coolest.  ,The driver seat needs more features. Dual 12V outlets would be nice.

I got about 380 miles out of the first tank (11.1 gallons) and I think that once I'm more accustomed to it, I'll do a bit better (I had a 94 escort, so this has much better acceleration than I'm used to). It drives better on the interstate than I thought it would with enough passing speed. Turning radius is tight, handling is better than expected and the ride is smooth for a sub-compact. Interior is roomy, I'm 6'2"" and have no problem with leg/head room, but it sits me a little too high. The cargo space is amazing for its size, having 3 glove boxes is nice.

Before my daughter saw the car, she suggested that I get tint, so people wouldn't see me.  After I got it, she thought it was pretty cool.  I went to a major public event, when I came driving out of the parking lot and my window was down, people walking by started asking me questions, about the car.

I am 6'4"", 280 and have more than enough room, actually pretty comfortable for a car in this class. As a matter of fact it is really roomy in front as a friend (my size) and I commuted around the DC area running errands and found it surpisingly comfortable for two guys our size.

Its got phenomenal gas mileage- almost as good as my inl-aws hybrid civic, and for half what they paid for it, so really its a better deal. Way bigger inside than it looks, really attractive body style (I especially love the front, it seems to smile at me whenever I walk out to it), and it doesn't feel or sound like a tin can which is often the case which cheap cars. It feels like a much more expensive car.

It has a slightly asthmatic sound when driven at only 30%. I think the car should keep the low weight but get the 1.8 from the scion xd/corolla. This would give it a more acceptable rate of freeway merging. The interior finish seems kind of cheap although better than the Chevy Aveo. And the rear defrost must be switched off manually, sort of annoying. ",Average 32 mpg with 90% city driving. Low curb weight.,"More power, add either a 6th gear or a taller 5th.

Most of my driving is highway and the Yaris has no problem going highway speeds and has plenty of acceleration to get up I-70 in the mountains outside on Denver.

I just like the idea of being able to travel more than 300+ mi. in 11 gallons of gas as opposed to +/- 300 mi. in 16 gallons of gas in my Vue. That is 5 gallons less and 100 more miles. My last fillup, I got 38 mi to a gallon. You can't beat that for a reliable, inexpensive non hybrid fuel efficient car. It drives pretty decent, acceleration from 0-60 is sub par (under 10 sec) but I bought it for it's fuel efficiency in mind. Since I installed an SGII, I am more conscious about how I drive and how much fuel I use. It can be fun to drive with the manual but the automatic is not bad once you got it going.","Essentially, it's fuel efficiency and lowest cost of ownership. It's compact size is perfect for parking in downtown where parking is limited. It's an inexpensive commuter car for people who are tired of paying big bucks in the pump.

The Yaris does a pretty good job of that for me providing close to ideal basic transportation. Gets you there fast and does it comfortably at a respectable fuel consumption rate. My biggest disappointment has been no place to hang a couple of clean shirts and pair of slacks. A fairly easy problem to fix but a real annoyance the dealership should have made sure was looked after. Seat belts work better than most cars but you need to make sure they are in place before you begin moving. I've had mine for 6 months and have 23,000 kilometers on it. Nothing has broken and no rattles. ",It is difficult to keep under the posted speed limit because it is so zippy and responsive at both the throttle and the steering. ,Another top end gear in the manual gearbox would be nice. Some additional soundproofing would help reduce some of the road and engine noise so prevelant in the 60 MPH plus range. Another inch of leg room would be a real asset to us tall people.

So I tried easing up on my ""hard driving"" and my last mileage check came in at 42 mpg. Maybe he was right or maybe it's just starting to get broken in.

The engine is fairly quiet for a small car with plenty of pep to make it move in city traffic and on the highway.   ",There are storage bins everywhere you look making it easy to keep things organized and clutter free.  Brakes work well even on wet slippery roads.  Seatbelts are comfortable and do not have the tendency to climb up your chest.,Driving long distances can be a challenge as you keep shifting to find a new comfortable position.  The huge windshield lets to see out clearly though you cannot see the hood and it feels kind of strange like there is no front end.  The rear window is small but the rear wiper keeps it clean.
5,2008 Toyota Yaris,Moonlighter ,03/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Japanese build quality is scarily worth considering over any other country, YES that good. I drove a 2008 4 door automatic during a service visit and got 40 mpg.  After driving the hatchback, I purchased it instead due to a more sporty demeanor, again getting 40 mpg. The build quality and quietness of this car has shocked many of my skeptics.  I am 6 foot 2 inches tall, weighing in at 235 pounds, plenty of room and love the front seats.     ","Fast steering, easy to park, peppy engine, build quality, reasonable price, styling, better than rated gas mileage, lots of aftermarket upgrade parts available.  ",Cruise control and ABS on the base 5 speed model without the power package upgrade.  Rear wiper/defogger and 15 inch wheels should be standard equipment.
5,A sweet compact car,a carpenter ,03/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,My Tacoma was getting to be about 8 years old and my commute was averaging around a hundred miles a day.  I needed to do something about rising gas prices so i bought this litte car.  The MPG is absolutely awesome averaging about 41 mpg.  I was concerned about the size of the vehicle but it is surprising how much room is really inside.  I even have room for all my tools and equipment after I fold down the back seat. Simply awesome!,"The MPG are the best, all of the storage is very cool, pretty quick acceleration, plenty of room, and great handling on the road.","Cruise control would be nice, lining of some sort in the fender walls, but nothing really takes away from this car!"
5,The Yaris is great ,jd6102 ,03/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I went from driving a full size trick to the Yaris and I am perfectly happy with the size my kids actually have just as much if not more room in the Yaris. And my gas bill was cut at least in half.,I love the mp3 jack. No more cds all over the inside of the vehicle. ,One more cup holder for the back seat. Maybe in the arm rest.
4.5,Cool little car,Phil ,03/15/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"This is an exceptional little car. Nimble, smooth, comfortable and quiet. Peppy at city speeds and adequate on the freeway. Engine noise typical for the class, but road and wind noise are hushed. Front seats very comfortable, though steering wheel a bit too far from driver. Large trunk. Adequate leg room in back seat for a 6-footer. Center gauges not a problem. Stylish interior. We liked the Honda Fit, but thunderous road noise and slow acceleration were deal breakers. Yaris somehow felt more solid and substantial. Professional car reviewers are enthusiasts and write reviews from that perspective. We found many of their complaints to be exaggerated or bogus. Give this car a test drive.","Reliability, comfort, ride quality, muted road & wind noise, fuel economy, decent acceleration for class, side-impact safety ratings w/side airbags. Came loaded w/everything except alloy wheels.","Short-person driving position, engine noise, lacks interior versatility of 5-door hatchbacks."
5,Great little car. ,wolfgang ,03/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I decided to go with a Yaris after driving a Camaro for 13 years. I love this car! It is peppy enough and sticks to the curves just fine. I am also 6'2"" and a large guy and I have plenty of room, in fact this car has more room than my Camaro. The back seat also has plenty of room for me to sit comfortably. I am also averaging 37 MPG and that is a mix of city and highway driving. I would highly recommend this car. Go out and get on the Yaris bandwagon! ","The aux input, the large amount of cargo space, the gas mileage and the amount of room inside the car. ","Only thing I wish I had is a tach, it didn't come with my car, but it really isn't needed.

Great handling, good gas mileage, which is so important in todays market.   Priced right.   It is well worth a trip to your Toyota dealer to test drive this vehicle.  ","Good gas mileage, Fun to drive.  Nice little subcompact car overall.",Only improvement I can think of is maybe a different spot for the cup holders.

5,Satisfied Yaris Owner,Commuter ,03/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I replaced a 1981 Toyota Starlet with a 2008 Yaris S Hatchback.  The new car is superior to the old one in every respect.  Fuel economy over my 20 mile round-trip commute in moderate-to-heavy traffic has ranged from 35 to 39 mpg thus far.  The car is tremendously fun to drive, and has plenty of power for freeway maneuvers.  Thus far, after 3 months -- no complaints!","Driver's side glove box, fold-flat 60/40 rear seat are favorite features.",Rear hatch lock should lock the passenger doors when locked with a key.  Would like to have an engine temperature gauge in place of warning light.

I LOVE DRIVING IT!  I never drive my large luxury sedan any more. I may be pushing 57, but in this little pocket rocket, I feel like a twenty year old zipping about in Europe.  I feel so smug when I pull away from a fat, super duty truck or the like. My first (not my last) Toyota.","Big stereo, unbelievably tiny ecological footprint","room for 20"" rims"

4.875,What a great car!,HappyYarisOwner ,01/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I have to say I was a tad hesitant to buy such a small vehicle, but after having it for a week, I can honestly say it does not feel small at all, either in terms of interior comfort, or the way that it handles and feels on the road.  I normally drive cars with manual trans., so switching to an auto had me a little concerned, but in test driving them, I found that the auto seemed a little quieter on the highway.  I do not regret the switch to auto at all, in spite of my reservations.  The car feels just quick enough to get it where it needs to go (passing, climbing hills etc), and offers great fuel economy. I have filled the tank 3 times, and have averaged about 36mpg 50/50 city/hwy.","Driver's side glove box, bottle holders, interior is surprisingly roomy, center speedometer.","power windows/locks/keyless entry, ABS, and side airbags should be standard if you ask me.

4.625,Great Car!!,Erica3737 ,01/07/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,I love this car. The only down side is the storage space on the dash. The cup holders are right in front of the vents so it melts a cold drink when the heater is on and there is only a center console and golve box but no other storage space available. Other than that I LOVE IT!,,Find a better place for the cup holders in the front so that they are not right in front of the vents. Add more storage areas

Excellent mpg (41 in the WV mountains), great visibility, great driver position, comfortable seats, well placed controls and gauges, plenty of torque, smooth ride, lots of rear seat room with the back seat slid back, and oh so cute.  I am 6'4"" and 280lbs and I have more leg, head, and hip room than I need. It hugs the curves so well that you will go much faster than you should.  I have owned SUV's that cost triple and I didn't like them as much.  You better buy one now before the price skyrockets.",I feel superior to all the Escalades and Navigators when they sit by me in traffic and blow by me on the highway.  I love knowing they envy my mpg.  The stereo is surprisingly good for a car in this price range.  The electric steering is amazing.,Some lining in the rear fender wells.

Mine is the ""Sport Model"" and has very comfortable sport seats (and I'm 6'3"") allow wheels, power pkg, rear spoiler, electric door locks & mirrors. The instrument cluster on the center of the dash is great, no looking down through the steering wheel. The hatchback design provides tremendous room for hauling things, with the split seats folded down. It has a high roof line which allows comfort for back seat passengers, truly a 4 person car.  I have three other cars and purchased this because I wanted something with good mileage for city driving. Little did I know how smooth and fun this car would be, freeway driving returns 45 mpg and 39 mpg in the city.","Sporty looks, fun to drive. Comfortable sport seats, speedo & tach easy to read in center of dash, easily seats four. Super gas mileage. Great performance from 1.5 liter engine. Hatchback offers lots of room & versatility.

5,Drive it/buy it,mike ,12/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I wanted a commuter car as my truck gets 15-16 mpg.  My choice was a Honda or Toyota.  The Yaris fit the bill. Good fit and finish, turns on a dime, 36-38 mpg around town/freeway and 40+ on freeway driving alone.  I figured that in a few years I could drive to work -55miles daily- and purchase a new vehicle with the gas for the same price of just putting gas in my truck and wearing it out. The oil companies will make minimal off my driving.  I purchased the arm rest-dealer installed for about $140.  This has been great!! worth the money.  Car is a blast to drive-co-workers say it reminds them of a remote control toy car.  Great value, great car- I've owned other Toyotas.","Styling is unique - sorry to say-""cute"". 3  glove/storage boxes are great.  MP3 hookup works great.  Power package is worth the extra money.  I wanted optimum safety so I got the ABS and side curtain airbags.",Make the arm rest an option instead of dealer add-on.  I'm constantly beeping the horn due to my driving-hand position and the large horn button.
4.875,Incredible Value - Great Car!,casqueiro ,12/27/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I cannot believe the quality for the price. The car is almost perfect, its extremely roomy and comfy inside, runs quiet and smooth and is super fun to drive with hands down the best turning radius of all time. I have gotten between 37-40 MPG on each tank with a 50/50 combo of city/freeway driving, except on one tank I got 35 with 5 people in the car the whole way. I haven't had it long enough to really judge reliability, but having just gotten rid of a lemon, I know what bad quality feels like, and this is a different world. Love this car!","Fuel economy, turning radius, tons of space in the interior, smooth ride, iPods sound GREAT running through the iPod jack. ","The knobs on the front console look like a 5 year olds toy truck, the panels in between driver and back seat are thick and sometimes make it hard to see other cars - look carefully! Stereo could be slightly better quality but how can I complain for the price of the car?"
5,I love this car!,Shana ,12/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am so happy with this purchase.  After reading literally hundreds of reviews and doing my research, I finally settled on the Yaris Hatchback.  I think it's  a great size - one individual driving to school or work fits extremely comfortably.  There is so much room. The car is very tall, and fits groceries so well.  The higher clearance works great for living in Fargo, ND.  So far the handling has been awesome.  It's been such a pleasure this winter since it's so reliable, gets so warm, and is overall so much fun to drive.  I'm beyond happy with my purchase.  I've been raving to everyone I know.","The handling is my absolute favorite part of this car.  The turning radius is so great that I'm not used to how easily it spins and turns and fits.  It fits into literally any parking spot.  The mileage is great, the ride of smooth, and I am even happy about the cupholders  - I think they are handy.","I would love if ABS was standard. However, the regular brakes have worked well so far on these icy roads."
4.75,Fun with sport,rwmech ,11/29/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I could only wish that it had a turbo.  This thing is fun to drive and handles great.  I drive a huge amount of miles and needed economy.  This car fit the bill and provided some sport as well.  For a subcompact it is very roomy.  Handles well and has all the basics.  Even without the power package this car satisfies the commuter needs at a fabulous price.  I love filling up for 1/2 the cost of my minivan.  The sport model gives you a little more in the way of handling.  Just a great all around car. ,Fuel economy is great.  Get at least 36 on my highway drive doing 70+ .  Handling is great and it's quite perky for the fuel economy.,Just a bit more horsepower.  The sport model should have a turbo or more power.  I think there are fuel efficent ways to do this.  It could have just a bit more room inside but it is a subcompact.  Power options should be standard.
5,An excellent little commuter car.,Chris from MI ,11/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've owned my Yaris liftback for about a week now.  Just finished my first tank of gas and got 38 mpg.  That is a combination of city and highway. I spent a lot of time researching all the options, including the Civic, Fit, Aveo, and Scion xD.  I was mostly looking for a second vehicle that was affordable, reliable, and got exceptional gas mileage.  The Yaris, I believe, provides the best combination of these things.  Just like every other Yaris, it is made in Japan.","All the little nooks and crannies for storage, including 3 glove boxes. Exceptional gas mileage, probably the best gas mileage of any non-hybrid. Manual transmission makes the vehicle rather peppy and fun to drive and offers better mileage.","Offer cruise control in the hatchbacks.  I would really like to have this option.  Also offer a 4 door hatchback, like in Canada.  It makes no sense that it is available there but not in the States.  "
4.5,This is a great car.,scb ,11/20/2007,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,5,5,"I bought this car just over two weeks ago and wanted to write an initial review. I replaced a Honda Accord because I wanted something smaller for the city and because I wanted better gas mileage. I am really impressed with how safe I feel in this car. It is also very fun to drive - it won't win any drag races, but it's perfect for me.",The aux jack is great if you have an mp3 player. The gas mileage is one of my main reasons for buying this car and it is great - I get around 31 mpg with mostly city driving.,The upholstery is not the best although it certainly isn't a problem. The steering wheel does not adjust front to back which would be nice.
5,Fun to drive & great mileage too!,ToyotaFan ,11/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After having several new Toyotas of all sizes, the Yaris 2D Hatch is the most fun to drive. I road tested the competitors and none handled as well, or were rated as high in mileage. This car rides very comfortably and the small turning circle makes it a real pleasure to manuver around in town. I've had mine 6 weeks and average 36 mpg in city only driving. A 300 mile trip on the freeway returned 42 mpg @ 70mph. The interior is very well thought out with lots of cup holders, 3 gloveboxes, & many small storage areas. Mine has the sport seats which have high grade material and are very supportive & comfortable. I could not be happier with my new 2008 Yaris.","Great acceleration for an economy car. Nice styling and alloy wheels. I'm 6'2"" tall and find the interior very roomy, with the sport seats. Great handling and fun to drive.","None,"
5,Small but mighty!,Scott ,11/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Yaris is a dream for long-haul commutes.  I get over 40 mpg on the highway, and well over 30 mpg just tooling around town.  Although small, I never feel cramped inside, and I love the control of the manual transmission.  This car has zip when you need it and is sporty for such an inexpensive car.  I commute 50 miles per weekday, and find I am filling up about once every 8-11 days.  And that's a $30 fill-up!  You can't beat this car for price, economy and style.  I love it!","Gas mileage, comfort of the cabin, multiple storage compartments and cup holders, roomy and adjustable back seat, MP3 jack!!!","Better stereo component, it drifts in high winds, alloy wheels should come standard, needs a hatchback latch on driver's side floor."

A little shifty, left and right on the freeway at high speeds (over 70 mph). Interior great quality and instrument panel good.  I like the ""free"" driver side so I can put a gps.

4.875,Really happy with this car,AK ,11/08/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I'm only averaging 42 mpg, but that's probably because I haven't been driving to maximize mpg - this car is very zippy, and I can't resist!  It's also very maneuverable, with an incredibly tight turning radius.  It's also darn cute, like a cross between a VW Beetle and a Camry.  Complaint: the transition from park to 1st gear is very jerky (and means I stall out a lot if I'm wearing other than my normal sneakers).  I highly recommend the manual transmission with power package and ABS brakes, giving you maximum control over the car.  (That way you also get a radio.) This car will last ten years no problem, and will carry me in style all the way.","Aside from the mileage, there's a surprising amount of room, and the driver is sitting up high (better visibility), both of which were unexpected and nice to find.  The interior is also much more nicely appointed than I expected.",1) shifting gears (engaging first gear from full stop). 2) Lumbar support. 3) Cup holder should not be located in front of air vent. 4) Rear wheel wells should be shielded somehow.
5,Best Compact Yet,zeeno ,11/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love my Yaris 3dr hatchback. It's fun to drive with an incredibly small turning circle which makes u-turns a snap. The mileage is fantastic, the automatic transmission is very smooth, plus I can choose to shift it when I want and the ride quality is great.

4.75,This is a wonderful car!,Tim ,10/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,I love the body and interior style.  This car really stands out with its cutting edge looks.  This car is very solid and handles well for a small car.  When on the highway I don't feel like im in a small car.  The inside door and dash material does scuff too easy.  I got the power package that includes ABS and a tachometer.  The basic dash without the tach was too plain for my tastes.  My backseat passengers have been suprised by how much room this car has.  The trunk is good sized.  Things are easy to get to in the engine compartment also. ,The stereo sounds wonderful.  The car is fun to drive and has great zip for a little car.  The gas mileage is definitely the best feature. ,The front seats could use some re- shaping.  I use a small pillow to fix this. The valve stems that monitor tire pressure need to be made of metal and not hard plastic for durability.  The steering wheel needs to be adjustable to move foward and back.  The rear wheel wells need gaurds. Still love it!
4.75,The Best I Ever Had,Sam ,09/28/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,4,"I bought the 2008 Yaris 9-14-07 and went on vacation. 44 mpg on the interstate, 41 mpg city and interstate. 3500 miles and not one problem. Am I happy. The only thing I didn't like was when you drive on dirt roads, the rear fender wheel wells have no guards and the road noise is bad.",Gas mileage is great and the duel trip meter makes it a snap to monitor gas mileage.,"The wheel wells on the rear need plastic guards to prevent wear and noise. and maybe some undercoating. Bells and whistles I don't need, road noise isn't needed either."
5,Solid!,KK ,09/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I needed to buy an economy car and I'd read a lot of good things about the Yaris (I did a lot of car research!), but I was concerned about getting something solid and safe; I didn't want to drive a ""tin can"". When I finally tried the '08 Yaris sedan, I was happily amazed. Surprisingly solid for an economy car! Has all the extras (side curtain air bags, ABS brakes, power everything) which pushed up the price but still was a great deal. Gas mileage is the best I ever had on a car. I've driven it almost a week and the tank level has barely moved. I'm surprised this car doesn't get more attention.","I find that having the console in the center makes it easier than having to look at it through the wheel!  Adapted to it immediately; I don't have to ""adjust"" to see. Also love: solidness; gas mileage; ""good looks"" factor; roomy interior and trunk; good quality sound system.","For the price, it's a great investment.  I've driven four other cars and this is my favorite yet.  I plan on driving it until it's run into the ground, and with a Toyota, that should be years and years from now!"
