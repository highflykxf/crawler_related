5,"8 years, 85k miles, 0 problems",Greg ,05/18/2016,5,,,,,,5,5,5,,,"After eight years and 85k miles, I've not had a single problem with my Aspen. It has not a squeak or rattle, and the engine still runs without a trace of vibration. The interior still cleans up like new after detailing even after eight years of kid/dog abuse. Our dog goes on the leather seats a lot and her nails haven't so much as scratched the leather. My factory brake pads lasted past 60k miles. The 5.7 Hemi doesn't exactly sip fuel, but it sure does tow when needed. Other than seeing the trailer in the rear view mirror, I can hardly tell I'm towing at all. Off road handling has been good on mountain dirt roads and beach sands. Other than scheduled maintenance and battery changes, I've not had to shell out a dime's worth of maintenance for the Aspen. AC is still as strong as ever; no seals, gaskets, belts or hoses have needed replacing; no degradation from wear and tear yet other than cosmetic items. As the original owner with a lifetime power train warranty, I don't see much incentive to replace the Aspen any time soon.",,

So far I've driven it 40k and it has NEVER had any problems of any kind!  After owning it for 2 years I bought 2 more.  The ride is extremely quiet and smooth and seats are comfortable. Leather interior is VERY high quality. Gas mileage is great at 22 mpg on the highway.  This vehicle does VERY, VERY well on snow and ice.  I tow a large boat and haul 6-7 adults with it regularly.  Handling is SUPERB!  When I found out they were going to be discontinued, I bought 2 more.  All 3 have never had any problems.

We put 37K miles on our Aspen, and it has never had 1 problem of any kind. We have had Nissan Armadas in the past which only get 16- 17mpg on the highway whereas the Aspen gets 20 mpg.

They have replaced everything that rotates and spins from drive shaft, trainy, front end, rear end .. now the steering wheel vibrates.

We are in litigation for a FULL BUYBACK.  stability on the SUV is very poor and now with the over extensive work done I'm sure the integrity of the vehicle has been compromised.  The latest noise since it's last return from the shop )kept for 30 days!!) is a very loud clunking sound from the rear end.

My wife saw an Aspen at a dealership and asked if I would test drive it so I did and I purchased it the next day. I got the fully loaded limited. We love it. I don't have a heavy foot so when I drive I can get in the city 17mpg, on  the hwy going 70 mph got 25 mpg. I think that is great for a big SUV.

We love the heated leather seats, navigation system, rear DVD, Sirius radio, and roomy third row seats. Gas mileage not great, but we didn't expect it to be.

I love the luxury of the Aspen over the Durango (lots of cheap plastic in Durango) but the Aspen is not as nice to drive as the Durango.  For some reason my Aspen feels sluggish at times. It also doesn't seen to handle as well as Durango. Aspen's looks and standard equipment are great for the money.

One of us is 6'5' one 5'11' and one jumbo sized. I got the cool vanilla exterior color an it looks beautiful.  I love the heated seats, back up camera, and gig touch screen radio and gps.",with the powerful hemi engine I can pull about anything I want.,none
4.875,Chrysler's Best Kept Secret,Linda ,04/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After 6 months of researching all of the crossovers, I stumbled upon this great find.  My previous car was an Expedition; rode like a truck.  This is a smooth, comfortable, classy vehicle.  All the bells and whistles you can ask for and absolutely affordable.  Plenty of leg/head room for adults; comfort measures for the kids.  Navigation system and media center is a great perk!  Able to download CD's to hard drive and eliminate clutter in the car.  Looking forward to taking it on long trips!","Luxurious interior; smooth ride; navigation; remote start, etc...",Absolutely none.....better gas mileage in the future.
4.5,Nice Ride!,ESA ,04/17/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,4,5,5,4,"Replaced my 300C with the Aspen.Definitely a better fit for a family who doesn't want to go minivan crazy! Seats adults and kids comfortably and makes its presence known on the road. Although the Aspen comes with some pretty cool standard features, only adding minor upgrades has been hard to deal with after the purchase (Nav. and entertainment system would have made this a nicer buy). Chrysler should also think about moving the body style further away from the Durango..I know as an Aspen owner I get a little peeved when people say, ""oh, you went and got the Durango?"" - NO! Overall, it's a sweet ride. ",Luxury look and feel and 2nd row bucket seats are easy to operate with the kids.,"Interior-  Paneling a bit flimsy, some have already detached. Weird noise also coming from somewhere in cabin that dealer cannot locate. Also, radio face was scratched from mere paper towel. Exterior - Accessories are not really available yet to customize."
3.875,Aspen Limited,Brian ,04/15/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,3,4,I have owned a number of Dodge/Chrysler products. I really like the Aspen. The MyGIG Nav system is great. The Hemi is strong and overall he looks are outstanding.,"MyGIG /Navigation, remote start",Try to get away from common shared controls IE: Durango
4.875,Love the Aspen,Nickie ,04/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love the ride it looks great, has everything you could possibly need in a vehicle for about $10,000 less than other SUV's. I got the one with the hemi to pull a travel trailer. Top of the line w/o 4 wheel drive msrp was $42,500 can't beat that.","Dvd, Navigation, 20"" chrome wheels, everything",Needs a darker leather and wood grain. We need options on the color of the interior. Don't like the manual fold up and down seats need to be power. Other than that nothing else.
4.875,What a super ride,Bobby Price ,03/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have owned 4 cadillacs, 2 chevrolets, 5 chryslers, 1 pickup, and now my second suv.  This 2008 Aspen is by far the finest ride I have ever owned.  I would recommend this Signature Series to everyone.  Yes, a little rough on the pocketbook for gas mileage, but it's worth the sacrifice for the comfort and the ride. This ride makes everyone stop and take a second look!","The head room and leg room with the interior are my favorites.  But, you can't forget about the driving experience.",
4.875,Great Vehicle. ,agist ,02/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just purchased this vehicle and am very pleased so far.  I have recently owned  Lexus and Nissan vehicles(both cars and trucks).  This truck makes me wonder why I ever payed the premium price of owning the other vehicles! This thing is great, quiet and smooth ride. A ton of features for the money and really quick. I got the one with the Hemi, Nav, My Gig etc. Anyone looking for a great vehicle at a great price, this is the one! Great job Chrysler!   ",Huge cargo area in a vehicle that has a relatively small footprint.   ,Power folding mirrors. Better job of advertising by Chrysler about how great this vehicle really is.    
4.875,I love My Aspen,Mrs.Thais ,02/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I traded in my 06 Pathfinder for my Aspen and I have to say that I love my car. When I drive it just glides along the road and parking has always been a challange for me and now with my back up camera its a cinch! The Aspen is roomy and luxury to max for the money . As for the gas mileage its great. If you're going to complain about gas then a SUV isn't for you. Not only is it a fun car with the ability to just plug in your I- pod or download some personal pictures but it's a classy car and I agree that this is one of Chrysler's best kept secret. ,My favorite freature would have the be my gig system myine came with. I love the fact thati can park this baby with out breaking a seat. The leather interior is also my favorite along with the drivers space. ,My suggested approvement is well..... none
4.875,Great Full Size SUV for the Money,Soccer Mom ,01/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought my 08 this month. There were only 2 left on the lot and this one had all the extras. Love it. Love it. Love it. Best SUV for the money and I haven't found a flaw yet - other than the gas mileage, but I knew how bad that was going in and was willing to make the sacrifice. It wasn't any better than the compact 05 SUV I was driving, but it was certainly better than some of the other full size models I was shopping for. ","The style inside. The spaciousness even though it has a slimmer body than other SUVs, it doesn't feel like it when you're inside. ",Hybrid. 
4.875,"Way better than Tahoe, or Expedition",tnvol ,01/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Got the 2008, with the hemi variable engine displacement engine. Extremely smooth ride, excellent handling on highway and in city driving. Not burdened with a lot of useless luxury items, but is loaded with very functional and fun stuff. Carried 4 adults and 2 kids  very comfortably. Gas mileage is what you would expect for a vehicle of this type. Love it and would recommend it highly. ","Fun to drive, viability, and ease of exit and entrance. It just plain looks good.",None
5,You won't be disappointed,shemadeitinaz ,01/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Chrysler won't let you down with this one either.  I have been out looking at SUV's for over six months and overall with interior and exterior features along with the Hemi under the hood I couldn't pass this one up for the what you get for your money.  I am not trying so seet 7 adults so the kids have plenty of room and are easily distracted by the DVD system anyway.  Definilety go with the 28J package there just isn't anything left on the wish list that isn't covered.,"Everything, the easy to access controls on the steering wheel, the wood grain accents through out, the heated second row captains chairs, the number of cup holders.  ",There is nothing I can think of that I would change about my new amazing Aspen.
4.125,Nice Truck,bak ,01/07/2008,,,5,4,4,4,,4,5,2,5,"I have been a big fan of Edmunds for a long time- but I have to disagree here. I have a 2005 Durango and recently purchased a 08 Aspen (because we enjoy the Durango so much).  While I agree that the trucks look very similar there is a huge difference inside the two vehicles. Even though they are similarly equipped, it is obvious that they went to great lengths to differentiate the two vehicles. The gas mileage is worse even with the same engine (hopefully because its new).  ","Touch radio/nav system, seats, smooth ride.",Hope mileage gets better- 10.5 Mpg in town.
4.875,Well kept secret,jmcolosimo ,12/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Chrysler doesn't advertise this vehicle as it should.  This is a fine, quality SUV especially if you buy it with the 28j package.  With this package, the Aspen is far and away the best bargain...when compared with Toyota, Ford, or the GMC products of like kind. This vehicle is way beyond the Durango.  It's quality is as good, if not better, than the aforementioned SUV's, but about 8-10k less.","Overall quality for the money.  Ride and quietness.  all the features you'll want.  Must order with 28j package, however.  Few other options needed.",More seat adjustments for passenger seat.  Better gas mileage(common problem for all suv's)without having to order the hybrid. (I've been getting between 15-19) with the hemi.
5,Impressive,MOPAR1 ,12/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is the only SUV I have ever owned that gets better and better each and every time I drive it.  The HEMI engine has power to spare. Consider the 20"" wheel group as it seems to have a much smoother ride and suspension. Luxurious, sharp & very inexpensive to lease for a 45K vehicle.","Hemi, My Gig, auto start, rear park with camera.. where do I start?",None
