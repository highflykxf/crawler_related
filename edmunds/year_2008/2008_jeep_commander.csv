1,WORST VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED,Lorelei ,03/20/2016,1,1,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,"Computer tells me I am getting ""8.9"" miles to the gallon, and that is ACCURATE. I spend more on gas for this hog than a mortgage payment every month. HORRIBLE RESALE!!! NOT dependable, despite regular maintenance from an accredited dealer. Horrible family car. I have four children, and they always have friends ride with us. Seats are hard and extremely uncomfortable for short drives. I would NEVER recommend this vehicle to anyone. Other jeeps seem to rate better, but as far as this model....big thumbs down.",,
2,Way too small for a family.....,Charlie ,03/08/2016,3,4,1,,,4,4,4,1,,,"I purchased this truck a year ago. As soon as I put car seats in the back, I couldn't sit comfortably in the front. You need touch the dashboard in the passenger seat, you can't even open the glove box. Driving the truck, I can't even see the gauges without sucking my head down because I was so close to the dashboard. And my sons feet are against my seat. And I'm not a big man, just 6:40. The rear storage is not big either. For a big SUV, the layout of this truck is terrible. The transmission was garbage. Had to put a new one in and 100000 miles. Seems like something breaks on it every other week. And the Jeep dealership near me needs at 2 to 3 week appointment to get service done. So if you want to go to the dealership, you need to make an appointment after you break down. Not very convenient. I will never own another jeep again!",,
5,"Wow, impressive.",Jeff ,01/04/2016,,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"We bought our 5.7 Hemi Overland Commander with about every option available in 08 brand new.   I was worried we might have problems with so many options down the road.  We now have 180k miles and besides normal maintenance like brakes or tires, we have only replaced a starter motor and that is it.   We have it serviced regularly and it has been amazing.  More than half the miles are highway, but we also use it to also pull our motorcycle trailer, and a 24 foot travel trailer in the summer.  It is starting to use a bit of oil now, about a quart every 2000 miles, but acts like it has a lot more life in it.  I have owned Acura, Mercedes, Jaguar, Ford, Chevy, Mazda, Honda, etc.  So far this one beats them all for it's reliability and lack of trips to the shop for any repairs, or check engine lights like my Mercedes routinely has.   My Acura Legend ( a fantastic car) is still in the family with 270k (still original motor and trans ) on it, but by 180k it had a lot more work done on it than our commander, like new radiator, AC compressor, etc.  I also had a Jeep Grand Cherokee with a 4.7 V8 and it was great, with few problems until I sold it with 130k miles on it.  My personal experience is outstanding with Jeep as a brand with reliability in comparison to any brand out there.",,

Started the vehicle, drove to the back of the house, to picked up my utility trailer. As I was leaving the drive way, the accelerator got jammed. The vehicle went out of control (live on dirt road) and raced full speed ahead. First reaction was to hit the brakes... that helped a little, quickly put it in neutral and turn the key off. Got my conposure, and started the vehicle again. It went right back to a very, very fast acceleration.

We have no need for the 3rd row seats, so that isn't a issue.  I highly recommend this vehicle if you want comfort & fun driving.  The downside, which I was surprised about, is the cargo space.

3,Great Intention/ Bad assembly,Bill  ,10/30/2009,,,5,4,3,1,,3,3,2,3,I bought 2008 Jeep Commander from Used Hertz car sales with warranty 14800 miles.

Four months later while going through Iowa the top of the windshield seal blew off for under head winds of about 40mph.  Jeep dealership tried to say windshield had been replaced.

It is truly one of the most enjoyable vehicles I have ever driven. I love the look and feel of it. The windows make visibility the best I have ever experienced except for the rear window view when the 3rd row seating is in place. The whole family loves it! We have had vans for most of our ""family"" years and wanted to get away from the whole van thing. This was a GREAT choice and I would definitely recommend one to anyone else.

For a family of four, the Commander has been awesome. The kids love riding in the third row because their feet reach the floor - only suitable for little ones because there's no leg room. The front is very spacious and controls are easily accessible to both the driver and passenger. I don't much care that there isn't much storage behind the third row when it's up, but it wasn't a deal breaker by any means. We look forward to our road trip next month because we'll have plenty of room for comfort and storage. Overall we are very pleased with this vehicle.",Third row for the kids - keeps them out of adult conversations. Stadium seating allows small children to see out the windows better. A/C vents and control in rear are a MUST have in Texas. Middle row three way fold down is very convenient also. Back up sensors are great when 3rd row is up.,"When 3rd row is up, it nearly blocks out entire back window so you can't see out your review - must depend solely on side mirrors and back up sensors.

My prior 06 commander had the 4.7 V8 and was underpowered. The HEMI is just right. I purchased a loaded overland model as it is truly the ultimate Jeep. The rear camera is helpful especially when using the third seat. It is a very solid vehicle. I like the styling as it reminds me of my first 1993 jeep cherokee country. I average 16mpg and on a round trip to Cleveland from Albany NY my average was 18. I drove around 70 mph. I really don't know why the press beats upon Jeep products so much.

But the plus side is how well they drive. Quiet, handles very well for its size. Acceleration with 5.7 hemi is awesome. Buy the hemi!  This thing can accelerate from 50 to 100 in a heartbeat. And is just as quiet and confident at these speeds. The equipment included is awesome. The sound system ( Boston accoustics ) is audiophile quality.

4.875,big power and huge fun,bigpower ,07/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I have a 2008 jeep commander 4x4 limited 5.7 big hemi v8 its power is simply amazing and is very fun to drive. the drive quality is the best even better than my grandmothers 2006 caddy dts and there is no road noise, I had a 2007 Nissan Xterra and the commander is by far the better suv on and off road plus better fuel economy. When I drive my commander I feel safe and in control it's a great big safe suv with an ample amount of power thanks to the HEMI!","No doubt the plush, luxury and rugged looking interior plus the the third row seat and hemi power.",Better leg room in the second row seat it can fit 3 large adults but not comfortably when it come to leg room but shoulder room is ample
4.75,It's a Jeep Commander Limited  5.7 Hemi,dr burke ,06/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I am very impressed with my Jeep.  It's fully loaded and roomy, for a single guy.  It has a 5.7L Hemi with variable displacement engine.  On the straight away, I drive on 4 cyl in 'power saver' mode and get 24 mpg @ 50 mph. I've found the sweet spot to be around 1500 rpm, if you aren't in a rush to get somewhere, it will increase your mpg by 5-10 mpg. I expect after more break in to average 26-28 mpg on regular gasoline.  I am happy with my MDE.  A few suggestions:  When taking off, when you reach 25 mph, 'Resume' cruise control.  And run on 1/2 fuel to increase mileage.  Use Quaker+Slick50.  ","Everything.  The way it slides over to the other lane, with no noticeable body motion and it's all where drive acceleration, leaves the dust behind when passing. I got the 'Let's refuel America' and hope the price of gas goes up to $6!  Anything over $3 I get a credit back to me, so gas will be free!","I would like rear tailgate seal to be tighter.  Dust collects in the bottom corners and is a pain to remove. Paint chips/ harden front window against rock chips. Don't like fog light covers, collects bugs. Engine under the hood, work light would be nice.   "
4.5,3rd Jeep Commander,dr burke ,05/19/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"Impressive.  Always inspires other drivers.  Envy. Gives you a safe, comfortable I'm in control feeling. Ok for married couples, but nix for kids.  Plush!  Right up their with a Caddy, but more beautiful and off road.   Got the 'Lets refuel America' deal for $2.99 @ the pump for three years or 800 gallons for $2.99 per gallon, for a total of 2400 gallons.  Deciding factor. No telling what gas is going to cost later this year or next and they credit you with the difference.  Say $5 bucks at pump, you get $201 credited back to your credit card.  Money in the bank.  Oh, they have a May sale going on $2,000 + $1500 + Gas card, if you push and ask to see 'special' rebate for dealers, to give you","The looks, the ride, the fun of driving a Jeep.  I like the power saver indicator for Multi displacement engine.  Put in cruise, 1500 rpm and go for fuel savings. Last hemi Jeep 25 mpg, this one 17, but still new and not broken in.  Expect more. ","When I have sunroof vent open, is rattles when I go over bumps, but close it and noise goes away.  2008 is best yet.  Everything I've always wanted in a Jeep. "
4.75,Great SUV,aangelovic ,05/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I have the 2008 Rocky Mountain package. It has the 3.7 V6, it's a little underpowered, but it's not too bad on mpg. On the highway it gets about 20 mpg and in the city 15. The one thing that I don't like about it is if it rained and there is still some water on the roof and you open the windows the water pours into the truck. It's even worse when you hit the brakes it just pours all over the inside. Thats the only thing I can say is an issue. Everything else is great, rides like a caddy, and is really roomy.","Ride Quality, interior room, and looks.",Fix the problem with water pouring in from the windows if the window is cracked open. Design better drains on the roof.
4.875,Best vehicle i ever drove,citygal ,04/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I enjoy this vehicle more than i can say;I miss not driving it, I can not wait until lunchtime at work to get in it. I have owned it for three weeks now. I had a Toyota 4 runner before that did not get good gas mileage. It is flexifuel so i can put ethanol (e85) gas in it; that was a bonus for me along with everything else it had to offer. I truly enjoy the my gig system with navigation.  I get about 15 mpg in city, and about 19-21 on hwy.","My gig system with nav, and bluetooth capable.  I like knowing i can drive safely not holding a phone.",tint the front windows a little bit.
4.75,Luv this puppy!,kerstuff ,04/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,This is our first Jeep. We replaced our BMW 525i with it. My wife needed something for her tradeshows to carry displays. It has plenty of room and is pleasure to drive. We keep our vehicles 15+ years and expect this one to do the same. We opted for the lifetime additional warranty that covers everything other than the lifetime drivetrain warranty. ,"MyGig Nav, no doubt. Being a computer type I love to load MP3's and have the GPS. The 2008 models are user friendly when it comes to software updates for the MyGig. We also love the backup camera and backup sensors.","As previously stated I wish it received better MPG but--let's face it, it is a real SUV and I would expect that. No matter what your personal feelings are about E85 flexfuel, it is nice to have the option in these times of uncertainty."
4.75,Luxury... Power... Style... Hi-tech,mekadeeg ,04/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,It is everything you could ever want from a vehicle. It is the 2nd 08 Jeep Commander in our family...(1) 4X4 and this one. The 5.7 V8 will never leave you in a tight spot...press the gas and your off...suddenly everyone is in the rear view mirror. The luxury details inside are right there with the best of them....and more. You can spend 80K on a luxury sedan and get half the features this Commander offers...and talk about a smooth ride. ,"EVERYTHING! The more you drive it...the more you feel like taking long road trips. Satellite everything...luxuries with Wood and leather accented interior. Smooth ride. Like I said... Everything! By the way, the remote start is wonderful...you always step into a nice cool car. ","The only problem you are going to have is that everyone in the family is going to fight over this car...that's all. I mean, if you're buying this jeep, you are not going to expect amazing gas mileage..but unless you're looking at a smart car..it is right there..plus it only requires regular unleaded"
4.75,Not driving my Benz. And don't miss it,H.R.B ,04/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,Purchased the Jeep Overland as a 2nd Car to have a spare SUV. My Benz has been sitting in my driveway since the day I drove the Jeep. I am selling my Benz and won't miss it! Every luxury in the world...power...and such an amazing ride. Never thought I would own an American Car much less rave about it. I would buy a 2nd one a 3rd one and a 4th one. Daughter loves the satellite TV and Daddy loves everything else. THANK YOU JEEP.,"The drive is my favorite feature. Smooth but very controlled and stable. The interior luxury features can easily compete with some of the finest sedans. Satellite TV, SatRadio,Hard Drive. You have a top-notch computer at your fingertips with an engine that will make you proud as you pass everyone.",Love to have steering wheel button that would answer BlueTooth phone calls. Not that stretching arm 6 inches is a problem...but this car spoils you. Gas mileage....I guess it's expected... But would not sacrifice engine power for gas mileage...and this car has the power.

3.75,Where's the sunroof wind deflector?,Atlanta Mike ,04/02/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,2,4,"Overall I love the Commander.  I have 4x4 Limited with the Hemi.  I live in the city so I only average 9.2 mpg but that's ok, my commute is only 1.8 miles.  On its one and only expressway trip (60 miles) I average 17.2 mpg - which is more than the EPA rating so I'm good.  There is only one issue I have with it.  I've never seen a factory sunroof that doesn't have a pop-up wind deflector.  It's impossible to drive with the sunroof open over 25 mph.  Am I going to have to go buy an external one?","MyGIG navigation, rear sensors, everything in the interior.  Power",Sunroof needs pop-up wind deflector.
4.75,Fantastic Jeep,Old man Jeep ,03/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Our Commander is a replacement to 2 previous Grand Cherokees and a Cherokee. We've been a Jeep family for many years and love the feel and drive of Jeep products. This one surpasses all others. It rides high with excellent front visibility and the seats are very comfy. The engine (4.7) gets about 13 mpg around town and about 19 on the road(not bad for a V8!) and has lots of power. The side air bags are a great safety feature. We heard the Commander might be eliminated in 2009. This would be a huge mistake, as this is the only full size (7 passenger) SUV that Jeep offers and is competitive with most larger family type SUV's. Also it is one of the few full size SUV's that is offroad capable.","The Mygig entertainment system, which was free, is awesome. Voice commands, a hard drive which holds hundreds of our MP3 songs and CD's, a touch screen GPS, Sirius  satellite radio, and rear camera!  Climate control has a separate rear heater and separate control. The power tailgate is very handy!","Improve the entry to third row seats, which is difficult. (We rarely use though anyway.) The jack storage compartment just inside the tailgate makes loading objects a little difficult as it sticks up too high.  "
3.125,Jeep Commander limited,MIchael ,02/29/2008,,,3,3,2,5,,4,4,1,3,"Going from a Toyota to a Jeep makes me realize how far Chrysler still has to go. The Jeep has been reliable and steady through the first 2000 miles but uninpressive.In reality, this vehicle should have seating for five not seven. It's just not big enough and because of this the ergonomics of the interior suffer.Instead of competing directly with the Grand Cherokee, I don't understand why jeep wouldn't ditch the Durango/Aspen and make this their full size vehicle and make it world class. ",Rear sky lights. Loaded with features. Pleasant and comfortable ride.,Gas mileage is atrocious. Chrysler has to improve this or this will be my last. Exterior fit and finish is sub-par. 
4.75,Love my Commander Overland w/Hemi,KmanCommander ,01/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"This vehicle is awesome The more I drive it the more I like it. I actually miss it when I am not driving it, and we are talking about a vehicle! It is unique looking, not like all those crossbreeds currently flooding the market... It is fast and powerfull I doesnt do to well with gas mileage, but what to you expect with a vehicle that is around 6k lbs?  With a huge 8 in it?  It has 330+ HP and always in 4.. I have been driving around looking for piles to drive this thing over.... It has so much power that nothing is intimidating. The electronics a cool.. nav, rear monitor, sensors, automatic window sensors.....etc I would buy it again","Powerful engine, comfortable ride, large viewing areas, windows in the roof for front and rear passanger. Camera and sensors in back. Light sensitivity. Never ever get stuck",Rear room could be 2 inches larger.. But the car is so nice that it doesnt really matter....
4.875,Jeep Commander is 2nd to none.,heartrok ,01/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We purchased a Limited model with every option.  Kids love the Sirius backseat TV.  MyGIG Nav with VES is simply fabulous.  QuadraDrive II makes driving in 10 inches of snow a breeze.  Build quality is top notch and overall this Jeep feels solid.  Backup camera is very useful in this vehicle as rear visibility is compromised with 3rd row seat up.  Too many useful options to name...UConnect bluetooth, Smartbeam headlights, hill ascent and descent assist, ESP, traction control, rear sky windows, etc.  If you are looking for a great SUV with tons of options for a fair price and not sacrifice quality...I strongly recommend the Jeep Commander.","MyGIG Nav, backup camera, tons of safety features, plenty of power with new 4.7L V8, sure footed in all weather, seating for 7, Jeep tough!","Fuel mileage is always a concern with today's gas prices, but the 4.7L is decent enough for a vehicle with this kind of power and performance.

I average around 14mpg with an occasional ""floor it"" moment. ","The 4.7L V8- very capable. The driver's seat- when it's accended I feel very in control of this 5,000lb SUV. I'm head over heals about the power liftgate, partly because I'm lazy, and partly because every time I let it do its thing there is always someone with a dropped jaw.","Put the MDS (Multi-Displacment System) on the 4.7L V8- It'll improve fuel economy by at least 3 or 4 miles, and in this day and age, that make a world of difference."

The Commander is so rich looking, inside and out and everyone who gets in it is very impressed.","The styling, both interior and exterior.",Gas mileage.
