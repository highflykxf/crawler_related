I'm tall and the car randomly squishes me up to my short wife's positions and I have to readjust EVERY part of seat position and mirror settings.  Memory seat setting buttons forget the settings.  CD player died (after 8 years).  All that said, the driving experience is great, good power and road feel for a vehicle this size.  Seats (esp 6-way power driver's) are very comfortable.  Easily carries 2 bikes and gear to races w 4 people.  Crams in 4 bikes and people with more bike dissasembly.  Goes fine in snow w good tires.  Great veh for long family trips or short hauls w lots of stuff.  NO problems at all with the OEM sunroof.  A/C and heat are both really good.  Love the heated seats. At 116k miles now my mechanic says it needs a new steering rack (leaking) and power steering pump (killed by leaking steering rack.)  Over $2,000 repair bill.  Yikes.

Everything is where it needs to be - cup holders, nooks, comfortable seating & decent mileage. My only gripe is AM radio reception which is limited to only local broadcasts - no distant stations can be rec'd where any other radio would, easily.

Gas mileage could be better but since we only travel 5000 miles per year, it's not a problem. Interior cargo space is plentiful.

Looked at the newer Chrysler mini-vans, and they are truly dreadful (that's why we kept the '97 for so long.)  Thought I would have to spend $$$ for Honda or Toyota, but I am very happy with the Sedona.  I have never checked fuel economy.  I drive it 1 mile to the train station for commuting, otherwise use it to carry lots of people and big things.  So fuel economy does not matter much for this vehicle.","POWER!  You have to be careful not to burn rubber, which is embarrassing behavior for a mini-van (even though it is red.)  ALL seats are comfortable.  Extra deep space behind the 3rd row seats, which fold down easily.","The removable 2nd row seats are tricky.  Took a few tries to figure out how to remove them.

I love how this car gets up to speed so quickly, I mean, I am ultra confident getting onto the freeway.  Transmission shifter is nice on hills, although I don't often have to lock into gears.

I was impressed with their customer service; it made an annoying issue easier to deal with.  Once that little problem was solved, the van has been a dream. I took it on an 1800 mile trip last month, and it performed flawlessly and was so relaxing to drive. Normally that kind of trip tires me out, but the driving comfort is so great that I was able to drive lots further in a day than normal. I can't wait to take more trips.",Very comfortable.

We have 4 small children and the Sedona is hands down the most convenient and comfortable auto we've had. I love almost everything about it. Almost. There are only a couple things to bring up. The interior cloth is cheap looking. Wish we got the leather. And although it seats 7,if you have to seat 5 kids I wouldn't recommend this car for you. The back bench seat is narrow so 3 kids in the back is tight. And the poor kid who has the middle gets an uncomfortable seatbelt",Looks nice and drives awesome. Love all the extra storage everywhere and huge glove compartment. LOVE the huge floor mats that basically cover the entire floor.

It has been working great, drives well, works perfectly.  It gets decent highway gas mileage (23.5 or better hwy).   The middle seats are so comfortable; much better than stow-n-go seats.

For $6000 less than the other two cars and a 5 yr bumper to bumper compared to the 3 yr, it was a no brainer. We were able to afford the power package and are very happy with the purchase.",Power Package,gas mileage
5,"Best Buy for Safety, Comfort , Handling ",Retired  in Midwest ,12/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Purchased in South & drove back to Midwest. 1st city tankful @ 17 and next 3 hwy tankfuls @ 22-23 MPG. Should improve. Handling, comfort & performance exceeded expectations. Seats are firm yet supportive.  One day drove 500 miles and we were not fatigued. Visibility is good. SWB is right length for grandkids. Sedona is rated ""safest"" minivan of all and key influence of our purchase. Price was also a leading factor. Similar sized V6 Toyota, Honda (Sienna, Pilot, RAV4) out the door in low 20s. Ours was in lower teens. Nice riding safe vehicle. Ride quality and feel better than its MSRP. Great buy w quality & warranty TBD. Now has 1,700 miles. We do a lot of driving and feel very confident. ","Safety. HVAC system is very effective. Heats up in a hurry. Can also be controlled in 2nd row seats, nice feature. Surprisingly responsive. Handling is very good given 4,400 lb. Gold color has gold flecks in paint, nice touch. Exterior doesn't look like lower end priced vehicle w many compliments. ","Sedona s/offer few options since few other SWB choices available. Radio controls in wheel, radio s/have RDS (vehicle slows down, vol. lowers), 6-CD option, 2nd row seats move back & forth, 2nd bench seat option, power sliding doors & back quarter windows, air compressor in rear, & Alloy rims.

5,Great Buy And Full of Value And Safety,Douglas lower ,11/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I previously owned a 2006 Sedona and loved it. I traded it in on a 2008 Dodge Gr Caravan SXT. I was very unhappy. I purchased a new 2008 Sedona LX w/rear DVD system. It comes very well equipped in LX trim. Extended wheelbase is the one to choose over the short. Safety features are the best in the industry. I would prefer power seats, but it was not worth the extra money of the EX. The powertrain is fantastic, powerful and smooth. It possesses confident handling. Braking is excellent. I chose Midnight Black w/Beige interior, the interior color is very soothing to look at. My 2006 was White w/Grey. I became tired of the grey w/the grey skies of Seattle. I love all the room, especially the headroom. PLEASING !  ","SAFETY, SAFETY, SAFETY! Roomy, comfortable seats, roll down windows in sliding doors, all the power features on the LX, visibility, looks in and out, fold-up table between front seats, ergonomics, driving it.","I would prefer a little extra seat travel for legroom, seat height is perfect. I'm 6,1 1/2"", but then they would need a telescoping steering wheel. I am happy the way it is though. If the car sits more than a year before being bought, have them Sand the rotors of rust."
4.875,Best Value on the Market,Steve Ice ,10/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have been shopping for a while and done much research on the Sienna, Odyssey and  Sedona.  All are great vehicles but I just couldn't justify spending $5K more and for less features on the the Honda or Toyota. Plus not to mention the 10 yr warranty. Kia dealers are giving employee pricing (you must ask) plus huge rebates on 2008's.  This is a great time to be in the market. Kids love it and can't wait to take it anywhere. Kia Sedona is the best value for the money on the market today.","Rear Park Asst, Power sliding doors and tailgate, Rear windows roll down, Michelins, on/off power door control on center console, Drivers view, auto side mirrors go down in reverse, storage capability, sto-n-go 3rd row seats, Side air bags for all rows, Highest Safety Rating, stopping ability.","Satellite Radio, GPS but easily get them cheaper aftermarket.  Everyone wants better fuel economy but the Kia does very well. Sto-n-go and swivel 2nd row seats instead of removable. TV/SAT reception on DVD monitor. Coin storage."
5,second time around,Allison Jones ,09/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is my 2nd Sedona. I had a 2004 model and traded it due to high miles for a new cross-over. Big mistake! After the first week I wanted my Sedona back. I just bought my second Sedona Ex a 2008 model. I already love it! My kids love it. It has an even better look and the inside is even more comfortable. I love all the storage space it offers .I feel confident I will be driving it for many years to come. It keeps getting better and better.,The easy control panel. DVD player. Room for children and all their stuff. Storage. Good looks. Blue/grey color Quality of ride in town and on highway,
4.875,More than expected,Jeff733 ,09/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Why buy one of those Japanese brands, when you have equal quality, less the damage to your checking acct. This car has blown my wife and I away (plus 2 kids). We traded '04 xterra and are pleased with our decision. We have a fully loaded EX, Black, leather int, ALL packages. We went to see it and were surprised at the luxury the Sedona has; the standards and extras were bonus. I can't imagine what car an negative reviewers drove, but this car is mostly quiet, smooth, and Fast! The sports mode, ""stick-shift"", adds to the fun! plenty of room, great visibility, great handling. Very nice! why bother with the Japanese high priced vans?",Sports Mode drive option. Sunroof. Engine power. Interior space and compartments. Infinity system. and many more.,"every van needs fuel mileage improvement. So, no improvements needed at this point. Kia has done a great job!"
4.875,Outstanding Van for an Outstanding Price,GVGiant ,07/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased the Sedona mostly because of price - it already was at the top end of what I could afford.  But having at least comparison shopped the other vans, and having driven it now for a few months, you will not do better at any price.  The look of the new Chrysler is downright repulsive, and you have to spend thousands of dollars extra to get the only competitive powertrain of the bunch.  The Toyota is priced hopelessly high, the Nissan has given too many people trouble, and our local Honda dealers do not have good reputations.  But even without all of that, there is nothing this van lacks.  It gets far better mileage than my last one as well.  Maybe THE best value in the industry.","Safety in abundance, and anything that you would want that may already be in other minivans, but you can get for less money.  My personal favorite is the EX cloth - incredibly comfortable, but I guess rather rare (most are either LX cloth or EX leather).","Obviously, everyone is looking for even better fuel economy.  Kia would really set the industry on its nose by coming out with the first minivan hybrid."
4.875,"Great Van, Great value",acher ,06/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Purchased a new Kia Sedona ex with all the bells and whistles. The more I drive the Sedona the more I love it. Jd power rates the quality better than Honda Odyssey. I've done a lot of research before I purchased the Kia. You are not going to find a better van which is safer, great value for the dollar than the Sedona. Plus the sports triptronic transmission is a nice feature. The Sedona also puts out 250 horse power, giving it a lot of power for a minivan. Gas mileage is on par with toy/Honda. The interior is very nice in leather with the heated seats, dvd player, sunroof, automatic door opener, abs, ets system, 5 star crash rating and the list goes on. Plus a great 10 yr warranty.","Leather interior, exterior finish, sports shifter, side windows go down, dvd player w/ wireless head sets, lots of storage especially behind the 3 rd row. Seat position memory, saftey features galore and 10 yr warranty. ",My only suggestion is that the dvd player needs to be thinner. Sometimes you can hit your head on the unit if your not careful. Would like to see plastic covering on the lower body panels and bumper to prevent scratching.
5,Best Van We've Ever Had!,workinmom ,06/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We do a lot of family driving and think we know mini-vans pretty well. We have owned Dodge, Chrysler & Chevy Mini-vans and when it was time to replace our last thought we really did our homework! One of our neighbors recently got a beautiful looking van so we while talking to them we discovered it was a KIA. They loved it and bragged on about it. So we did even more homework and found we could get everything we wanted and save 4 to 6 thousand over Honda & Toyota! And that 10 Year Factory Warranty was more than twice that of the others. It became a no brainer for us. We love our new KIA Sedona. ",The extra money we had after making a smart choice!,
4.875,Great find,Amy  ,06/01/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After test driving and researching other mini-vans, we found the Kia Sedona to be the best performer and the best value.  I gave up my SUV- loving ways and purchased a minivan in preparation for the birth of our first child.  I can now safely say that I don't miss my SUV at all!  With a baby on the way and two dogs to transport, this van really is the most convenient and fun vehicle I have driven.  Great handling and features like the stow away third row seats have made us thrilled with our decision.",Fold flat third row seats Fold down center console Roll down windows in second row Rear Heat/AC controls,Seat fabric could use an upgrade - tends to attract fuzz from all around.
2.125,This Car Is Horrible,Dave ,04/23/2008,,,1,2,1,5,,1,1,5,1,"This car is not what I expected. It looks good in the pictures, but is totally different in person. It's very wide and fat. The blueish color is disgusting, if you get this vehicle don't get the blue color. The interior is also bad. The fabric used for the seats looks and feels horrible. There is also not a lot of leg room, or storage. The vehicle drives like it is very stiff, and jerks every few seconds. I recommend getting a different vehicle, anything but this.  ","I do have to say I like all the buttons you can push to open and close the door, or open or close the trunk. Other than that nothing else.",Better exterior and interior design. More storage. Better performance and more options available to the car.
4.625,A happy surprise,prlady1 ,04/12/2008,,,5,4,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just weeks from giving birth to my second child, I have been experiencing problems with my 2000 Volvo S40 and feel it's time to do the minivan thing. My husband and I were not expecting to enjoy our test drive of the Sedona, but it has tremendous pick- up and was actually kind of fun to drive, relatively speaking! Its styling, convenience features and functionality are all worthy of minivan-style praise, and it feels like a great value for the money. ","powerful acceleration, functionality",armrests and some cup holders seem likely to display effects of wear and tear
