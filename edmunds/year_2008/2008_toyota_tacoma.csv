5,My 1st Used Toyota Tacoma,Winston ,12/02/2015,,,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I sold my 2011 Silverado v8 with 31k miles on it and brought this 2008 used Tacoma (4 cylinder 2.7). I drove it off the lot with 42k miles. I love this little basic truck, it's comfortable for my 6'1 350lb frame. I brought it to drive back and forth to work (40 miles round trip) and to fool around on the weekends. I barely use my other truck at home. I'm sure I'll get 300k miles out of this truck. It's fun and basic and easy on your wallet at the gas pump. I get about 23 mpg on the highway which is better then my Silverado. Perfect little truck!",,

4,Mixed bag,rmw288 ,06/23/2014,,,4,,,5,,4,5,,,"I bought my Tacoma used in 2011 with about 25,000 miles on it.I drove it for 3 years and 55,000 miles.I never had any kind of trouble with the engine or drive train, as far as reliability.It never broke down.My complaint was the truck always revved a little high while at idle.Also, the shifting was always weird.At low speed it would stay in low gear too long and rev high before shifting.Under load, the engine would knock.3 of the 4 automatic door locks eventually quit working.The compass/thermo stopped working.The A/C fan would intermittantly stop working.Car was totaled in an accident in 2014, and I replaced it with a full-sized truck for towing.",,
4,"Good truck, disappointed in 6 speed gearbox",gazzbc ,04/26/2014,,,4,,,5,,4,4,,,"I bought this truck second-hand to tow a 23' trailer, weighing 5500 pounds loaded.The truck is underpowered for what I'm asking it to do, but gets the job done.Just don't expect to win any drag races.The Sport package handles extremely well for a 4wd live rear axle truck, and is stable towing even with P rated tires.  *Update* - upgraded to LT tires.  Towing more stable and the effect of the stiffer, heavier tires on handling is barely noticeable.My only real beef is with the 6 speed manual gearbox.It is the slowest, clumsiest tranny I've ever encountered.Forget quickly flicking through the gears - each shift is a two-stage affair with a forced pause at neutral.And it's not just my truck - I drove several examples, and they are all the same.It's a pity, because it is fun to drive otherwise.",,
3.625,Disappointed,richiew13 ,03/07/2013,,,4,4,3,4,,4,4,3,3,"I bought this truck in May 2011, hoping it would be a reliable and economical vehicle for me to keep for a long time, eventually becoming my #2 vehicle.Ever since I got it, I haven't been happy with the way the engine idles.It sometimes revs fast, and sometimes wavers up and down.I also dislike the way the transmission shifts.It can sometimes be harsh and/or wait too long to shift.As of now, 3 of my automatic door lock mechanisms have quit working.The A/C blower is noisy, and will occasionally stop working.(If you kick it, it will work again.)I hate the way the brakes make a ""clunk"" sound the first time you hit them after going in reverse.Other than that, I've enjoyed it.",,
4.25,Love it!!!!,fatvette ,04/08/2012,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,4,3,This has been an awesome truck for what I use it for.I bought it new in 2008 and it currently has 31000 mile on it.Although the miles are relativity low I have not had any failures of any type.The truck has been flawless.The truck is very comfortable considering the bench seat but I did add an aftermarket center console/armrest.Having a place to rest your arm made a big improvement over holding it in your lap or resting on the seat.Engine power in more then adequate.Brakes are a little spongy and road noise on this base model is noticeable.,"This is the base model so features are somewhat limited.
I added as options an automatic transmission and air conditioning.",Intermittent windshield wipers and a standard center console/armrest.

Unfortunately, the quality of the 08 Tacoma is disappointing and Toyota's response to documented suspension problems has been unsatisfactory. There is a widely known noise problem with newer Tacomas' suspension that the company has not addressed.The truck is now an embarrassment to drive because it groans so loud.Toyota Customer Cares does not at all!

5,Great truck!,George ,10/31/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The 4 cyl does all I need it to do and more. It's been up and down the mountains, through tough places, hauls loads, pulls moderate trailers and just keeps going without problems.

It has class.","Style and power, very roomy inside.",Gas mileage. Come on people. And when put into drive it jumps forward with out touching the gas. Seems like that would be a recall issue.

5,Functional and reliable,dinola ,04/08/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have had many toyotas over the years and the prerunner has continued to be a reliable vehicle.  It gets good gas milage for a toyota tacoma and is a safe truck to drive.  I expect to have it for many years.,The hooks in the bedliner are very functional.  The look of the truck is very solid.  It is also fun to drive.,The access doors are a pain for costco runs or anytime you need to load something with a car next to you. You need to open both the front and access door to get to the back.

4.625,Great in the Snow,Kevin ,03/26/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,We just ended a record-breaking winter in Washington with about 70 inches for the season (normal is about 8 inches). The Tacoma was unbelievable--even in 15-20 inches on unplowed streets it never quit.  We took it out about eight times the first day just for fun while the neighbors were trapped. The truck has also been great on trips and has much more power than the 1998 Taco it replaced.  Toyota bought back the old truck because of frame rust and made it easy to buy the new one. ,"Sound system (added an Ipod interface), access doors, composite bed and the 400 watt AC plug that keeps the wide screen TV working even during power failures!",Built in Ipod interface.
4.5,Typically reliable quality Toyota,Steve ,03/21/2010,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"Nice truck. Reliable, quiet.  4 cyl has enough power 95% of the time. I don't tow loads.  Manual transmission helps with both power and gas mileage.  Access doors are just right.  Don't need the silly looking full rear doors.","Quiet, comfortable, almost carlike ride.  Good Gas mileage (for a 4wd truck--23 mpg lifetime).  Plastic bed won't rust. ","The only 'improvement' relates to the upsizing of the Tacoma nameplate.  Toyota should go back to the pre-2004 size of truck, and make all of them hybrids.  35 mpg, please."
4.25,"Great Truck, But...",Steve from Wisconsin ,01/24/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,3,4,2,5,"I have the 2-wheel drive PreRunner with the TRD offroad package and locking rear differential, 4-wheel ABS with electronic brakeforce distribution and brake assist.  All in all, I rate this truck the best-engineered vehicle I have ever owned--a wonderful piece of work. It is sheer pleasure to see the intelligence used in its planning and execution.  But I have traded it in after two years of ownership (for another Toyota) because it is dangerous on slippery roads. I have had multiple spinouts on snow, even when proceeding slowly and carefully. (The only other minus is the mileage, but I was fairly warned, so can't complain.)  This 2WD isn't for snow country. ","Great engine, handsome styling.","I'm tall: 3 or 4 more inches of legroom would be nice.  Once seated in the cab the headroom is fine, but I have to duck to get in.  The grips help, but a higher doorframe would be better yet. Track-and-cleat tiedowns in bed are a good idea, but a bit flimsy: series of tough D-rings would be better."
3.875,Good not Great,Vantrader ,12/29/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,4,3,3,4,"Overall, a good truck, but not great like I'd thought it would be.  Anti- lock brake system makes a ""doosh!"" sound when the vehicle is initially started and begins to move.  Brought it to the dealership and was told it was the brake system doing a ""self test"", hmmmm.  Annoying more than anything else as it was a 30k vehicle.  Find myself keeping the tranny in D4 around town as it is quick to upshift into the highway gear but slow to downshift.  Should have gotten the limited slip option as it slips pretty easy in loose gravel or greasy hard-top after a rain.  Have not towed with it yet but have used the bed and it performed well. ","Best looking mid-size out there, period (are you listening Nissan/Chevy/Dodge?).  Lots of torque present but tranny is slow to respond especially at higher gears.  Brake pedal way too close to the gas pedal, my size 10 shouldn't come close.    ","Change tranny for more high end torque, limited slip standard (think this was changed in 09).  Get the brake away from the gas pedal!"
5,"56K miles down, 944K to go!",Tango6 ,12/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Yes I do expect a million miles out of this truck. I bought it just before I retired from the Army. I used it in the field transporting troops and gear, daily driving around town, and hauling a lot of gear across the country. I change my own oil every 5K miles(Toyota filter & Mobil 1).  I've added a K&N air filter and a tri-fold toneau cover. Took a trip up to New Mexico and checked the mileage. I got 24.8 mpg. This included highway & city driving as well as a lot of hills. The truck is very comfortable for cross country trips. In addition to changing my own oil, I change my own spark plugs.  Maintenance on this truck is easy due in part to accessibility. It also has tons of great storage!",Great tie down system in the bed.  Great storage area under rear seat.  Huge console storage and door storage lets me keep plenty of stuff at the ready.  Has great 360 degree visibility for driving.  ,Make the tailgate lock standard. I used an aftermarket after no dealer had a truck with one.  Cup holder between gearshift and console needs to be bigger.  Maybe offer a power sliding back glass. Not much room for improvement on such a great truck.
4.75,Love it,jeff ,11/23/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,Love the truck for the price. Got the base model with automatic. No complaints. Would have been nice if Toyota would have added wiper delay as part of the BASIC package like almost everyone else. That part is annoying. Have bench seats. Would have liked bucket but like I said I got the base model. It was priced lower than any other truck in its size. And hey it's a Toyota. It will run forever. Nuff said,new body design was a major plus,Put more in basic package like tilt and delay wipers. 
5,It doesn't get better than this,The Tom ,11/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this 1 year old truck used at a dealer. It gets 18 plus mpg. The access cab area doors open. It has way more room than my 98 Tacoma. It is quiet. It commutes well. Composite bed is genius. My 98 Tacoma was bought back by Toyota in 6/07, for a defective rotted frame. I was heartbroken.

4.75,Best truck on road,Kristen Ohler ,08/31/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I owned a 1990 2 wheel drive Toyota extra cab for 18 years.  Best vehicle I ever owned.  I sold it with over 300,000 miles on it.  I wanted a 4 wheel drive new p/u.  I love this pick up more than any vehicle I have ever owned or driven.  It is a fast and good looking p/u.  I love the stereo system/cd player.  It has a lot of pick up and contrary to reports I've read my pick up is very quiet. I've had no problems at all in the 14 months I've owned it.  Although the running boards look great, they are in the way trying to get into and out of the p/u. I would never own any other kind of mid- sized truck besides the Toyota.

3.75,Never Buying Toyota Again,perfect-storm ,08/27/2009,,,5,5,1,2,,5,4,4,4,"I purchased my 2008 Tacoma 4x4 intending to keep it a long time as they are supposedly known for reliability.  Mechanically, the truck was fine and had no issues.  I liked the truck and enjoyed driving it.  Fuel mileage was OK with an average of 17 to 18 mixed city and highway driving.  On the highway, it would get 20mpg if you stay under 70mph.  I recently got rid of the truck as the frame was rusting excessively.  I have never driven it on a salted road and I did not park it anywhere near the coast.  Toyota's rep was extremely condescending and absolutely refused to do anything. No treatment, no coating, NOTHING!  Check toyota frame rust issues and realize the problem still exists in '08.",Fun to drive and decent fuel mileage.  Lots of interior room for a smaller truck.  The truck won't last though.  ,FRAME QUALITY!!!!  Absolutely unacceptable that a 1 year old truck that has never seen salt would rust to the point of being able to chip rust flakes off of the frame.  Toyota knows NOTHING about CUSTOMER SERVICE.   There were EXTENSIVE frame rust issues from 95-2004. THE PROBLEM WAS NOT CORRECTED.

Put 24k miles on my '08 so far and no major complaints. The SR5 4.0L V6 has more than ample power. Roomy interior. Gated automatic shift lever does not have locking button so that the lever can shift at anytime if it is accidentally bumped. The downshifts could be smoother and less often, but aren't that big a deal. Wish I'd gotten the stick shift instead, but at the time I wanted to try an automatic after 15 years of my old truck.  Love the suicide rear doors on the access cab. But rear seating is cramped and should only be for short trips or kids. ","Tons of power. Roomy interior. Composite bed liner (seems like plastic but it's supposedly stronger than steel). Bed storage for ropes. Adjustable tie down cleats. Storage under rear seats. Looks great! Fun to drive! Safety features standard, like ABS and stability assist. ",Weak braking - should be rear disc brakes instead of drums. Improve gas mileage with cylinder shut offs when cruising. Low seat height - should be powered seats with full adjustments. One rear speaker vibrates plastic inside the rear door.

I have the 4.0L V6 PreRunner & which ever one is the 4-door. I absolutely love it. Used to own a Dodge ram 1500, and I'm glad I got a Tacoma, though I wish I had gotten a Tundra.  Pros: Good & Powerful 4.0L V6, Somewhat good fuel economy (depends on how you drive, as with every other vehicle), Great off-roader even though it's 4x2 (just no mudding or something of that sort), I got 0-60MPH in about 6.5-7 Seconds. Cons: Side Curtain air bag became standard on 2009 model, iPod connection became standard on 09 model (big deal for me), Somewhat jumpy if you don't have any load.","-The Biggg 4.0L V6, lots of power! -In my opinion, this truck is overpowered -Stock radio and speakers sound nice, compared to the ones in my old RAM.","-Should have made the Side airbags standard on the 2008 model -Same goes for the ipod connection, I'd like it more if it came standard, living in a city (Houston) where the FM frequencies are clogged, makes using an FM transmitter useless and (or) unusable."

My roof leaked because of a defect on the factory- installed roof rack (took them 3 times to fix). They replaced the outside seal around the windshield because it was making a ""whistling noise"" at 75 MPH. Truck wouldn't start sometimes and they couldn't figure out why. I just gave up on it and let somebody else worry about what else could go wrong with it. GOOD BYE TOYOTA FOREVER!! It's the end of an era.",Comfortable ride.,Exterior panelings need to be in line with the high price of this vehicle. Don't build it cheap and sell it high. Need proof?

While crawling up hills though several inches of mud, the Tacoma tracked very well where other (much larger) trucks had slid off the road and torn up the brush.  My Tacoma has forded many streams and climbed over rocks without developing any problems.

4.875,First Toyota Truck,Kevin ,11/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is the first Toyota truck I have ever owned. I've only had it a few weeks but could not be happier. Plenty of power for passing and a very comfortable ride for a pick-up truck. The interior of the truck was set up very nicely with no gauges being blocked from your view with the steering wheel. I've seen several reviews from professional websites that claim the seating position is too low. I'm 6'2"" and I say the seating position is too high. Other than that an overall exceptional truck.","Roomy interior, comfortable ride, powerful.",Should be able to adjust the driver's seat up and down.

Traded an '03 Dodge Dakota for it, and what a difference.  Not all good, sadly. As some have said here, the brakes are horrible and Toyota should be ashamed of them. The peppy 4.0L V6 makes the 3.9 in the Dakota seem like a 4 cylinder however, with excellent torque and high end power. Ride is good... it's a truck, after all. Much more comfortable than the Dodge, and I love the dash/control layout. Once I wear out the atrocious stock Dunlop tires and replace with something decent handling will be great.","Reputation, reliability, looks, power.","Better, all around disc brakes.

When you are stopped the RPS are ~ 900 when the truck is rolling and not in gear the RPM go up by them self to ~ 1300? When you are moving in gear and you let off the gas the throttle does not close very fast, it feel like it closes part of the way then in 2 sec it shuts completely. All of this I think hurts the gas mileage 16-17. May be the auto would be better. Yes the cd player need to play MP3s and the 4wd low in trick (but when you learn to push the clutch first it is fine) and the stock tires are low grip. One more thing the plastic bed is very slick.

The ride is way better even with the TRD offroad package my 04 did not have. The 04 wandered all over the road, the 08 stays centered better. Every gripe I had about the 04 seemed to be fixed by Toyota in the 08. Don't get me wrong the 04 was a great truck, with absolutly no mechanical issues in 38,000 miles of use. I'm sure this 08 will be the same. I just wish I had opted for the top line stereo. Was told it was only available in sport package. This truck tows my 2200 lb boat effortlessly.

Although I have been  sold on the overall quality of Toyota, I am somewhat disappointed with my present truck. I get vibration in the steering wheel between 55 and 70 MPH. After three trips to the dealership and replacement of two tires,I still have the vibration. Now the metal framework in the seatback on the driver's side is coming out through the fabric. The A/C fan motor would only work on high speed (resistor replacement required). The transmission shifts rough, the door speakers buzz when the bass is turned on step 5 (volume is only at medium).

I live in Northern California, and like to go camping, and snowboarding.  I went with the TRD Sport 4x4, and it drives like a car.  No body roll, or jarring bounces like other trucks.  Very smooth ride.  I used to drive a Volvo, which is notorious for having the most comfortable seats, and the comfort factor is very similar in the Tacoma.  It has tons of interior storage space, and is very well laid out.  I also installed a new exhaust system, and it gave me an almost 20% increase in MPG.  17 to around 19 city, and 19 to 23~24 hwy.  Overall, incredibly pleased, and would buy again.","Exterior styling.  Steering wheel controls.  Seat comfort.  Toyota maintenance plan (free maintenance and car wash).

Pickup is smooth and the bench seat okay on long trips.  Don't care for the Dunlap tires; they're smooth, but sure don't have the quality of Michelins.  I added a factory cruise control and 2 factory 'D' ring tie-downs to the front of the bed.  This little rascal ought to come stock (or at least available) with intermittent wipers & cruise.  It rides & handles just fine. For a basic 4x4 under 20 Grand pickup, I don't see how you can beat it.  Tight, no rattles, easy to do maintenance, pretty dog-gone good ride.  I'm a bear to satisfy...and I'd buy this one again in a second!","Ride & handling both very good;  bench seat is okay, gas mileage okay; build quality great; good both as highway and off-road rig and maintenance is a snap!","Need options list expanded to include intermittent wipers, automatic transmission & cruise control.

With a camper cap on the bed and at 69 MPH I get a solid 30 MPG on trips.  Around home I still get a respectable 25MPG, although I drive with efficiency on my mind.  Performance is adequate and the handling is mushy compared to my old Pickup, but the ride is much better and the interior is much more comfortable. ","The gas mileage is excellent for a vehicle of this size.  The 6'1"" bed is important to me as I sleep there camping and on long trips.  Most other small pickups have beds an inch or two shorter which is real important if you want to sleep back there.","I would like to see a a more aerodynamic hood shape.

The wind noise overpowers conversation and the radio, the wipers make an irritating thunk/thunk noise, and the outside temp/compass indicator is difficult enough to read due to a reflective glare. The seat bolsters are narrow and uncomfortable. Gas & brake pedals are too close.

I was about to get another truck but when I tried this one, I had no choice but to take it. It is simple, reliable so far, and looks sturdy.","Good low rpms above 60 mph compared to my old V6.

The 08 Tacoma is a solid well built truck with all the features I could want.  Six speed is fun to drive and gives a little better engine break control in the snow.  The TRD package provides some great seats and other features.  The truck runs solid if not a little rough but it is a truck and with the bed loaded it smooths out considerably.

The GMC had a smoother ride on the highway, the toyota is bouncy. Offroad the toyota has the advantage with more ground clearance and absorbs large bumps better. The edge in handling and turning radius goes to the Toyota. Body roll is alot less on the toyota. Fuel economy is only slightly worse on the toyota then the GMC. 20.7MPG Toyota vs. 21.4MPG GMC, in my standard work to home route. Fit and finish on the Toyota are way above the GMC.

Had really been looking at Colorados but after seeing how sharp the black Tacoma w/Rugged Terrain package looked, reading lots and lots of reviews, and doing extensive research, I was hooked. I am glad I spent a couple thousand extra dollars to get too many extra features to count over the competitors, not to mention Toyota reliability.  The truck rides smooth, almost like a car, but can turn into a mean mud-flinging machine off road. I have had it in the mud once and I was really impressed with the off-road ability, even in 4x4 high.  The 4.0 liter V6 is amazing... extremely powerful throughout the power range, tons of torque.","Sharp looks, very solid feel, quiet car-like ride, comfortable/suportive sport seats, large access doors, off-road performance, towing capacity, excellent heat & AC, rear AC power outlet, storage under rear seats, great floor mats with the TRD, and lots of cubby holes to store stuff in.","Gas mileage is much, much worse than I expected.

As much or more interior room as a Honda Civic. On the down side, the truck rides a bit like a truck. Ford and Chev both rode more smoothly. Also, box is pretty tiny, so consider getting the long bed. I went Toyota because, well, it's a Toyota. I'm getting quality and I don't like spending money at the auto shop. VERY happy.","Leg room, interior space, cab design and layout, instuments and gauges. Toyota quality.  ","Small bed on short box, so consider the long bed.
