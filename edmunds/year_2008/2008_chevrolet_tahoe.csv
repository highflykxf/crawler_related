1,Stay away!!!!!,Donald Peacock ,08/02/2016,,,5,,,,,,4,,,My family and I love the room and the features.  The eletrical issues are crazy.  While driving the truck will shut off in the middle is the road.  I figured out if I wiggle the negative wire the power may or may not return.  I contacted GM a waste off time.  The only thing they told me was to take it to the dealership and let them run a diagnostic.  I told them that this has been done before and they could not figure out the problem.  Leave GM products alone!   And the rear differential went out at 75000 miles.,,

It's got 130k+ miles and going strong if I had a front end that didn't clunk.  Won't take it on a trip unless it gets fixed and I'm not sure the car is worth fixing.",,
4,08 Tahoe LT,Bryce Holloway ,10/09/2015,5,4,4,,,5,5,5,5,,,"Starting with the cons, the front end clearance is similar to a car, I recommend a leveling kit, the locks are garbage. However it is a very smooth ride even with the 20"" wheels. The fuel economy has not gotten worse or improved, still sitting at 15mpg city/hwy combined. Towing is acceptable, strong power while towing and transmission stays cool during long hill pulls. I recently camped in the back of it for a weekend for a race event and was impressed with the cargo room (me being 6' tall) I slept comfortably. My only recommendation is to life the front end and beef up the brakes if you'll be towing quite a bit. Also, expect to replace faulty locks. Overall, I'm impressed with this purchase.",,

I never bought before dude to styling of interior - the 2008 styling is really nice and ALMOST up to European standards but still a little ways to go.  The towing capability with the air adjusted ride is amazing - the truck literally will adjust itself based on the amount of weight added.  Gas mileage is ""OK"" but what I'd expect in a large V8.  not sure the ""switching to a V4"" feature makes any difference.  The review states it's a chore to take out the rear seats - I think anyone in general good health will not have issues removing the rear seats - I've never found it a bother. how often do you need to take them out, really?",Interior design - NAV - stereo is great.

We should have just bought another Tahoe, it's now the only car we will own.  We prefer the 4.8 L engine since gas mileage is reasonable considering the size of the SUV. We also prefer the LS since it doesn't have the cumbersome cup holders between the front and passenger seats - we prefer to have the area open.

This is my 3rd ""current generation"" Tahoe...had an '01, '04, and now the '08.  A few ""fit and finish"" issues with seat covering pulling away from cushion...but nothing too tragic. They did fix a service bulletin item on my first service visit...problem with spring over left rear tire being slightly eskew caused a weird klunk when you went over speed bumps. Fixed at no charge...about 1/2 hr work. We've been very happy with the car. Gas mileage is better than a Honda Odyssey with lots of room, comfort, and luxury.  Recommend highly...but haggle cause everybody's dumping their SUV's these days.","XM integration, rear seat DVD with wireless headphones, power liftgate, remote engine start, auto folding middle seats (got the Captains Chair second row...highly recommend).  Rear seat heaters. Navigation is easy to use","BlueTooth! Navi doesn't allow waypoint changes while vehicle is in motion, must pull over...what a pain in the backside."
4.5,Fun Ride,hammer760 ,05/05/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"I've had my LTZ now for about 2 months and am pretty happy with it.  Had an '03 Sequoia and was about to pull the trigger on an '08 but decided to test drive the Tahoe...thank God I did.  Better looking, more features, and a better price than the Toyota. Only thing the Seqouia had which I wish the Tahoe has is fold flat 3rd row seating and a little more rear storage room.  I've towed our boat and the automatic rear leveling suspension (which I guess is only available on the LTZ) works great.  I wish I would have bought this a few months earlier to try the 4x4 out.  By the way the guy who wrote that he's getting 18.3 mpg 70% city is a liar.  I'm getting 14-15 mpg in 50/50 city/hwy driving.  ","Overall exterior appearance is beautiful! 20"" wheels (although they are a rip-off at an option price of $1500), Nav, DVD player, XM, power rear lift gate, comfy seats, overall power but GM needs to ditch the old 4 speed and go with a more modern 5 or 6 speed.",Terrible front storage room with no dividers inside the middle arm rest. Where do I put my change? Ipod jack should be placed at the bottom of the center console. No bluetooth is a joke. Verizon wants $15 for 100 minutes. Backseat windows only roll half way down. Plastic woodgrain looks cheap.
5,Extremely Impressed - '08 Tahoe LTZ ,Mike ,05/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After 1.5 years of SUV research and actually targeting the Denali, we  found the White Diamond LTZ and were totally impressed over the Denali! Purchased this beautiful SUV w/White Diamond Pkg, 20"" Wheels, Sun/Dest Ent Pkg, Titanium Interior 2 weeks ago for my wife and we both absolutely love it! I cannot say enough about being so impressed with how far GM has come in their interior design, dead-silent cabin, feature rich appointments, and overall comfort. With 2 kids, bags/laptop cases, a  stroller, and almost daily trips to the store, this SUV is the most awesome and fitting vehicle we have owned to date. We intend to use the OnStar, as it will incoporate family shared plans on Verizon.","Customizable settings set by driver for pwr locks, pwr mirrors (curbtilt in reverse), daytime lights, driver seat exit feature - just to name a few. Bucket seats offer excellent comfort and pwr options, int door panels appear to be made of excellent, long- lasting materials (no fade or peel anticipated)","Seriously cannot think of any, as I continue to be impressed every time I climb into this american made SUV."
3.875,Now we go in a Tahoe,dwightex ,04/29/2008,,,5,4,4,4,,4,5,2,3,"Bot this car since we commute 1x week 200 miles back and forth from home to work through the mountains of western Maryland. This truck is a dream to drive on the highway. We bought the car because of 0% finance and GM rebate. The $49,000 sticker was really the same price as a $36K car, so it was a good value.  We are pleased, except that the car is so big and heavy it is a little tough in the city. Gas mileage for us is 16.9 combined over the past 5000 miles. ","Comfortable drive, just like first class on an airplane. Great seating position, sound, XM, visability.","3rd row seats are taken out manually and weight a ton. I never would have bought them, except they were in the car. We hate them, they are in the garage. Also, storage area has plastic rails and slots for the seat, so you need a plastic cover for them. Also, Nav system screen is too bright, won't dim"
4,08 Tahoe purchase,D S W ,04/22/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Compaired Tahoe and Toyota Sequoia, bought the Tahoe. A lot more equiptment for the money, nicer interior and better gas mileage. New 100K/5yr warranty also helped with decission. I have the LTZ with all the toys and they all work as advertised. Ride is very smooth,the V8 to V4 modes are seamless. Biggest negative is rear seating, especially the 3rd row and the lack of independant rear suspension. The Toyota is the winner in these areas. The 08 Tahoe appears larger than my 03 Tahoe Z71 , but it has the same dimentions. The 08 is less truck like than the 03 with a lower dash. The 03 did have more storage areas than the 08.      ","OnStar system, nav system, rear backup sensors and camera, side airbags for all passenger areas. ","Better 3rd row seating, also should have independent rear suspension. More storage areas would be welcome. Needs a 5 or 6 speed auto transmission like many of the other makes."
4.75,Sweet!,Chris ,04/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Just got my wife into the 2LT with the Sun & Entertainment package added in. It's basically an LTZ without the chrome and the heated rear seats. We got it black with cashmere (tan) interior. It's super sharp looking. The wife loves it.  Our goal was to have our three kids fit across the 2nd row bench seat, leaving plenty of cargo room -- or room for other kids. It's no problem. The kids love the DVD, and the wife is loving the sweet Bose system with sat radio, nav, and the rear view cam. I can't wait to start trying the OnStar, and try towing my boat with it. This makes our old (loaded) Pacifica look pretty lame. If you need the full size SUV for the family, this ride is truly great.","Bose system, tow package, ride","Fold flat rear, power liftgate."
4.875,Great American SUV,ajayboyapati ,04/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,i just bought a black LTZ and sure it is a head turner with the chrome package being standard. It came with the 20 inch wheels and love the way they work with the shocks and suspention. All together they give a very comfortable ride.,Touch screen navigation is easy to operate. Remote start with preset temperature controls is a great feature. Tire pressure monitor. Heated windshield washer fluid. The little strip on top of the console between front seats is perfect for cell phone. Power folding outside mirrors. Park assist is very nice,Not having a bluetooth is my serious concern. I have an ATT phone with a new contract and that would not help cause Verizon is the service provider for OnStar. I am stuck for 2 years without bluetooth. GM should consider bluetooth as it is illegal to talk on the phone and drive in some states.
4.75,The new family car,ChrisThe SpaceCowboy ,04/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"My family recentley bout a white diamond edition LTZ Tahoe 2wd. The vehicle is excellent its luxurious but we still can tow our boat with it! The navigation system and power tailgate make for easy loading and directions. The OnStar system is also handy. My mom already got locked out, and they opened our doors right up. The car has some Escalade bling to it as well. The 20"" rims accent the metallic white diamond paint well. The chrome grille makes the truck look more powerful. And it gets fairly good mpg for a full size truck as well!","Navigation system, XM satelite radio, OnStar, power tailgate, DVD player",Better mpg's

I purchased this vehicle with all available options including the Z71 off road protection. Have had it loaded with 3 hunters, 25 geese decoys, 3 duck blinds and all our gear, and could've added more, can't wait for turkey season. This vehicle handles exceptionally well and is an absolute pleasure to drive, always comfortable ride and has felt safe to drive in all of our weather conditions- rain, ice and snow.","Love the new exterior and interior changes with this model. So many features to enjoy from auto-start, auto-rear hatch opener, touch screen navigation/stereo/dvd display. Bought to use for hunting/golf trips, but passes for ""Sexy Sport"".

4.75,Best SUV I've ever driven,Greg Rank ,03/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Growing up as the son of an executive in the auto industry, I started at a young age having the opportunity to drive many different styles, and types of vehicles. My first personal SUV purchase was a 1991 Chevy Trailblazer. From there, I've owned, leased or at least have driven every GM style SUV, both full size and mid size. In December, my company decided it was time for me to turn in my 2003 Chevy Tahoe as it had 167,000 miles on it.  Picking up the new Black 4wd LT was very exciting, however, I didn't realize just how exciting it truely was going to be. It rides better than most cars I've driven.

4.375,Huge improvement!,mark ,11/17/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,1,5,"2008 Tahoe w/ 2LT. Compared to my 05 Yukon SLT, the new Tahoe is a huge improvement.  Interior, specifically the dash, is now luxurious as opposed to looking like a cheap truck. Leather is much better quality.   3rd row seats still don't fold flat, have to manually remove.  But now the 2nd row doesn't fold flat. They tumble forward to allow access to 3 row. Nice if you need it, but I'd rather have the 2nd row fold flat like the older version that made the cargo area cavernous. Yukon was loud, lots of wind noise. This Tahoe is quiet and has a very smooth ride. Expert reviews complain its too soft and unresponsive. I'll take soft any day. Not doing slaloms in a 5500 lb trk. avg 16 mpg",Great looking SUV. Much nicer interior. XM builtin. improved Leather.  Rear parking sensor a plus.  Smooth quiet ride. Actually like new front buckets without the armrests better. Flex fuel is useless.  Fuel mgt seems to be a gimmick. same mpg as yukon.  Doesn't stay in 4 cyl mode long enough. ,Add blue tooth.  Add flat folding seats.  At least provide option to have 2nd row flat. Center console needs an organizer. It's like a woman's huge purse - you'll never find anything. At least give an ashtray or coinholder.  Would like to have parking assist on front bumper for parking in garage.

I am very satisfied with the choice and I saved $25,000 over the others.  The Tahoe so far exceeds anything I experienced in testing out the BMW or Mercedes.  The fuel economy should improve as I break in the engine.  Recommend this awesome car!

4.875,Previous Ford owner,Leanne ,10/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"As a previous Ford owner, we are trying our first Chevy. So far, it has been great.  OnStar and navigation systems are a very nice asset.  The comfort is comparable to the Ford Expedition, possibly more room in the front seats than the Ford counterpart. Ride is what you would expect from the SUV vehicle market.  Interior is roomy with rider's comfort in mind.  Third row is tight and Chevy needs to take a lesson from Ford in this area.","Rear camera and dual controls for the AC/Heat for driver and front passenger are a welcome addition.

My Tahoe LTZ is very well built, comofortable, beautiful and drives every bit as well as any import.  I recently bought my wife an Audi Q7 and, with the exception of the Audi's Ipod interface, I enjoy the Tahoe hands down over the Audi.  I only wish that Chevy would finally put in fold flat seats in the vehicle.",Great looks.  Great build quality.  LTZ has every feature you could ever want and some.
