I am so disappointed that they have chosen not to continue manufacturing them. That is a real mistake, as the FJ is a fabulous as well as unique SUV! I am currently looking to possibly trade mine in for a new one, only because I want to be able to own one longer! Toyota rules, and it is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned.

That is, they are not flush.  This makes it awkward to load/pack/carry some items.   Fuel consumption roughly 17-18 for highway driving. Not as bad as I'd expected.

It is a disaster of design. The interior is dark and visibility is terrible. I can get by these issues however, It's the worst SUV I've ever driven when it comes to performance in snow. We hit the slopes whenever it snows and this vehicle is brutal. Regardless of tires, it's not safe to drive. Coupled with it's nervous anti-lock brakes it's a dangerous vehicle to control in a blizzard. Our Xterra performed much better, with the Jeep being the best.

Although the average sized woman will never be able to put a bike up there. It's very high and you can't use underground parking if you have any racks on it. Looks good... but it's a sheep in wolf's clothing. ,Stop focusing on aesthetics and improve snow performance. Rear seat belts are very slow to recoil. Improve seat cloth so it doesn't trap lint or dog hair. In-ceiling speakers distort with any volume or bass. Redesign rear for better visibility. Doors trap you if trying to exit by parked car.

It is a very capable off-road vehicle. I have had it off-road on some rough trails and the FJ performed like a champ. Visibility is not that bad and it is something you can get adjusted to.

It was time for a new vehicle and I had decided to buy another Honda. The night before I went to buy it I was on the computer researching cars and read the reports on the FJ Cruiser. I decided to go and give it a test drive that next morning.  Thank goodness I did.  I knew the minute I drove it this was the SUV for me.  I love it!  I have only had it for a short time but it feels safe and I love the way it handles. Oh, did I tell you how great I think it looks?",Everything!,I would love for it to have back doors that open like the front ones.

It was big purchase for me because I wanted a vehicle that was going to be truly reliable and not in the repair shop all the time and I have worked previous at 2 GM dealerships, even all my mechanic friends give it 2 thumbs up! I've driven in some pretty crazy 4x4 zones with it and it's performed excellent, and a truly fun truck to drive. I don't find the blind spot a big deal and everyone that has sat in the backseat has found it easy to enter and exit. I would suggest to all, to take one for a test drive. They grow on you... they are a different driving experience and different is good from the norm.","I love the suicide doors, easy access. The stereo is great..it's neat how you can change the colours on the display panel. The interior is so easy to keep clean and the cargo area door lock feature (for wind) is awesome. I love the windshield washer vessel.. it's huge. My #1 is the Balanced Engine!!!",The windshield does chip easily.

Have a friend with a Jeep Wrangler and goes toe to toe off road with it and is much more practical.  A few things I would improve would be the seats do not have a forward track for the people getting into the back seat.  You have to manually move it forward from the front.  The rear windows do not go down.  Does not seem like a big deal, but the wind whips through the truck like crazy.  Last thing would be the back window would be nice if it would go down like with the 4 runner.  But all in all I would highly recommend this vehicle!!  BUY IT!

I drive conservatively (coasting in neutral when I can), taking off slow and planning for stops ahead of time - right now, I'm getting better than the advertised MPG (25% city driving). It's a pleasure to drive and very comfortable. The only problem is getting into the back seat - Toyota should have provided some kind of handle to help pull yourself into the back seating area (my youngest struggles to get back there, clawing at anything she can to help herself in).",MPG - 20+ and climbing,better entry to rear seating area

Major blind spots, but nothing you can't get used to, no worse than in a pick up truck. Engine really scoots. Gas mileage isn't great, but acceptable for suv. Not a vehicle for everyone. I find there is more that I like about it, then there is that I do not like about it. Lots of great after market accessories available, but have to wait until warranty is up.

The 6 speed FJ is a joy to drive, performance is commendable & the off road capability is amazing. As a daily driver I'm getting 17.2 mpg with 50% in town travel. The Trail Teams treatment is well thought out, all the off road goodies in one package, and the Iceberg White monotone paint with black accents is very attractive as well.",Fun to drive. Shift action of the transmission when coupled with the TRD short shifter option. The TRD exhaust note is throaty & pleasing under throttle yet quiet while cruising. And my FJ just makes me smile.,"A supercharged diesel in the 200 HP, 325 Ft Lb range would be a killer package in the FJ.

Every time I drive my FJ I fall in love with it more and more. I'm 40 this month and driving it makes me feel 21 again. Sure the blind spot everyone talks about exist, but it is not hard to get used to. As for the gas mileage complaints, I am running regular unleaded in my FJ. It runs perfect and I'm getting a combined 19 miles to a gallon right now. That is great for this type of vehicle. Really great leg room in the front. I purchased the sandstorm color, and love the color more every time I look at it. ",Driving the FJ is my favorite feature hands down.

It's easily handling the current No. Indiana winter. No problem, from mushy slush, to blowing thru drifted-over county roads. It tracks and runs well. Could use better visibility but you'll learn to drive with the mirrors. Ventilation could be better. Having a small issue with the paint job on the hood.

Unlike some of the 4wds I've owned, this FJ allows me to engage/disengage the 4wd therefore allowing me to save money on gas, 20mpg.

4.875,Not Your Average SUV,Randy Vorster ,12/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"If you plan to go off-roading opt for the All Terrain Pkg. It comes w/ very nice 16"" wheels (diff look from the 17""), great shocks, locking diff, A- trac, pre-cleaner & multi-info display. I ordered the TRD exhaust which I think is a plus, cool ellipse tip and sound. It came with blk running boards which will not work as rock rails, but will save you from car- level door dings. Ride quality is great for a 4x4. We have gone on fun adventures and seen things that would have required some serious hiking. With the right mind-set the FJ will make a great primary vehicle. As a 2nd vehicle to our German sedan we could not be happier. Hard to imagine the sedan is now a 2nd choice when driving to work!","Classic looks, stands out from the cookie cutter SUVs. Its a Toyota with the heritage of the original Land Cruiser. Seats with water resist fabric. Skip the carpet and get the serious rubber mats (you will not be disappointed).

I have traveled the far reaches of the western Utah desert and the close reaches of the Buckhorn draw desert. I have gone up hills and over terrain that I have never been in an SUV, only a honda 4 wheeler. The heater and music are a lot better than the 4 wheeler.

Nothing radical, just steep and rutty stuff, and it handled great. When changing directions after a stop, you seem to get time to go from brake to throttle before you start to free roll much. I loved going back down Jones Pass Rd, jamming into 1st gear at 20 mph and doing a 180 down to the next switchback. The FJ felt real stable, and handled the bumps like a pro. On the pavement, the ride is nice and not ""trucky"". 20 mpg highway/city/mtn is great. My 2.9L Ranger was no better than that.","Knobs big, good with gloves on. Not fancy, just practical. Not a ""soccer mom's"" car (thank goodness), more of a ""guy's toy"" vehicle, although it's my one and only. No carpet to stain. Nice sound system/aux jack. Room for the grandkids, too.

Off-road capability is top notch. Rocks, mud, water crossing - the FJ has pulled through for most. Personal experience has proven that if you take the vehicle off-road, or add after market wheels and/or bumpers, the warranty is voided. So, either buy it for city driving or buy a different vehicle for off-road use if you need a warranty.","The capability, style, and uniqueness of this vehicle put it at the top of my list. Simple engine layout, easy access, and Toyota quality.","Additional power outlet would be nice, the one outlet limits cell phone/iPod charging.

The driving position is excellent, and the seats are comfortable.  One can't help but feel safe with all the standard air bags, stability controls, and just the sheer size of everything. The FJ says cool simplicity vs. sophisticated.  Fuel economy is not great, but is better than many SUVs.  While not for everyone, the FJ is easily the best car I have ever owned.
