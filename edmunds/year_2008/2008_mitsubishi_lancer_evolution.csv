4,1 yr later with the Evo X MR. Still fun!,X MR Owner in LA  ,04/07/2010,,,3,4,4,4,,5,4,3,5,"Update after 1yr w/ the X MR. The X is a fun Daily w/SST; I use Manual more than AUTO. My commute is more city than hwy; MPG avg 14.7 over the yr. Interior scratches easily, esp the trim around the glove box & radio. Rear vis with wing is poor. SST autoshifts slow when cold. Storage space: It is what it is. Trunk for wknd trips is ok (two carry- ons); big items need to go in the backseat (dog carrier). Leather is easy to clean/just wipe down. Front seats are comfortable on long road trips. Perf in bad weather is confidence inspiring. Track (Willow Springs) perf is excellent! Turn off ASC and it's Point and Shoot. Helmet clearance is not a prob-I'm 5'9"". This X is way better than any XBox. ","The X MR is really a wonderful driving experience. The Stock suspension is good for commute-not harsh. On the track is a dream. Best feature is ""ASC OFF""! Easy to control; stable at high speeds (thank you wing!) Stock tires offer great grip; Brembos had little fade. Wife loves to drive it too. ","Remove the fogs-will help with SST and oil temps for track, but will need larger tranny cooler for longer sessions. Stock Brembos are OK; upgrade to better pads & SS lines for better braking feel. Larger sway bars help tremendously with body roll. A simple drop-in K&N air filter makes good power."
4.875,Amazing Evo X,grayevox ,02/21/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This AMAZING car is my daily driver and our family car for almost 2 years now. It's very reliable, safe, and SCARY-FAST around the curves, due to it's superb AWD system. It has an extremely responsive handling on asphalt and is very nimble in the pouring rain. It truly is a great TUNER'S car and the 4B11T engine will easily handle 400hp to 500hp:) The interior is mediocre and the trunk is tiny, but the Recaro seats and RockFord sound system are excellent. Gas mileage isn't too bad, my average is 24-26mpg on the hwy. Draft behind an SUV within my 40 mile commute and my 450hp Evo can get 26-28mpg.

It still has the cheap interior, thin paint, and bad gas mileage, but the X is a MUCH more comfortable car overall. I'm not a big aftermarket guy, but a tune really goes a leap ahead of what is already an excellent car performance wise. The S-AWC makes the new safe Evo even more safe than it already is by letting you turn the car suddenly without it even batting an eye. Like others have said and will say a strong 6 speed manual would be nice, but I don't drive fast where I live... the speed limit is still 55 and with the tune and a bit of added timing I can get 24-26 on the highway.","having a display to let me know what's going on, controls on the steering wheel, S-AWC","6 speed or a longer 5th gear, better paint and interior made from a little better materials.

I don't even drive hard or launch the car, but around 12k I had to change out the clutch. I ended up getting aftermarket clutch and new flywheel because of the warp. Beside that I enjoy the car and the fun that comes with it. I joined a local car club and ended up mod a bit out of the car... Gas stinks, but it is a 2.0 pushing out near 300hp on a 3k pound car...

It's by far the fastest car I've ever driven and for the money it's a steal.,The power/speed is by far the best part.  The handling is a close second.

At first, I will say that we were very excited about our purchase.  That was until we waxed the vehicle for the fourth time 1 1/2 weeks ago.  My husband noticed a massive amount of paint chips above the rear tires on both sides of the car and also on the hood.  I searched the web, and found we are not alone!  Tons of people have this affliction, and Mitsubishi has done nothing for most of them.   Do not buy this vehicle unless you want your paint to chip off, or your windshield to chip with 3000 miles on the car.  Very poorly made and will not last. Worst purchase we have ever made as far as quality.  Huge regrets.",,Fix the paint chipping issues and do not blame road conditions for the cars design flaws.

The car handles amazingly well.  We were torn between the Subaru WRX STI and the Evo.  After driving the Subaru, we felt a bit ""lost"" with the six speed.  I would agree that this car having a sixth gear would not be a bad idea.  I also say that these ""all over the board"" quarter mile times that they are reporting are completely inaccurate for the car. Haven't has the chance to romp on it yet as it only has 200 miles.

I have owned BMW to RX8's and sedans/SUVs in between.  It was a toss between the RX8 R3, 350Z, G37, MB or BMW.  For the cost and driving fun I think it is a great value PLUS it seats 5 and I can take the kids and wife every blue moon to keep her content.

The handling is outstanding; I am amazed at what this car can do on winding roads.  The transmission in this car must be driven to be believed.  In Sport mode, the shifting is crisp and firm.  The downshifts are perfectly timed, and are done better then I can run a clutch after 20+ years of driving.  The logic that controls the transmission is very well set up; I haven't even touched the paddle shifters.  The car is always in the gear that I need.","Looks; this car turns a lot of heads, and I always have people asking me about the car.  Transmission is excellent; I will never buy a manual again when this typr of transmission is available.  Technology package was worth every penny, as well as the body kit.

Most fun car I have owned. Just like the last review, I had to replace windshield at 800 miles.  BUY the clear 3m paint guard, especially front, and rear rocker in front of rear wheel.  Great stock stereo, but no steering wheel control, seats are great, if you fit their ideal size, because they hardly adjust, plus the material is cheap, and wears quick.  This isn't my only car, so it fits me perfectly.  Personally I could use it as a daily driver.

(front, rocker panels, and trunk deck)  Second the windshield is wafer thin. Mitsu did this to save weight. I got a minor chip in mine and the windshield split when trying to repair it. I'm replacing it with a standard lancer windshield which is thicker, but heavier.

The handling is truly the best thing about the car. The steering is telepathic, and the brakes are excellent. Power is fair, but the second factory reflash helped smooth things out and helped the upper rpm range. I fixed a rattle in the glovebox, other than that the interior is quiet. Tire noise is high, but the upgraded satellite radio/audio system is superb. Aftermarket parts and tuning solve the power issues quickly and easily.","Handling, brakes, audio system, cruise control (A first on an Evo). Recaro seats are nice, and the car truly has great looks especially from the front. ","Interior quality is still only fair, clutch is soft, tranny is notchy and needs a 6th gear for the highway.

I was planning to get a reasonable car, like an Acura or something, but figured you only live once, so I got the Evo.  I have a perma-smile since I drove it off the lot.  The few things I don't like, the driver seat is not very adjustable, the shifts into 2nd and 3rd are kind of clunky until the clutch warms up, the trunk is tiny (not big enough for golf clubs w/ sub, and no fold down seats for snowboard) and the road noise is loud on rough surfaces.

It is such a different driving experience than the torque monsters I am use to, but I love it! It takes turns and curves like it is on a rail. I miss fish tails and power slides, but being able to take turns at speeds my Camaro SS could never achieve makes up for it. I would recommend the Sight Sound and Spoiler package for potential buyers. The bad, seats are a little uncomfortable & need more adjustment options.

It's a bit heavier than my IX was, but it makes up for it with a vastly superior chassis and substantially better handling potential.

No more timing belt!  Fueling is just pig rich stock.

I thought  I would have said the suspension and handling, because that is where all the hi $$ stuff is, but so far I am impressed with the thrust.","This is my first car in 15 years where the lights don't turn on by themselves at night.  The MR has the feature, but I bought a GSR."
