2,Doesn't drive as good as it looks,Mark ,07/28/2016,15,,1,,,4,3,2,2,,,"After owning this car for two years and driving it 15,000 miles per year, I have to say that I am quite disappointed. It’s a very beautiful looking car and has stood the tests of time very well, and hasn’t needed anything yet. Granted that mine has very low mileage for its age, I can always count on it taking me where I need to be without fail. But the driving experience is lacking in so many areas. Compared to other cars on the market, it feels very “amateurish”. Kind of reminds me of Kia cars during that initial phase when they were trying to make the brand more appealing to consumers but still weren’t tuning the driving dynamics right. The 2010+ G37 coupes and sedans are better vehicles, but as for the 2007-2008 G35 sedan, there were numerous kinks that had to be worked out. The car just doesn’t feel confidence-inspiring. The whole thing is just too unpredictable and I never feel like I have proper control over the vehicle. It’s stubborn in the way it behaves on the road and the vehicle never listens to driver inputs. The thing that probably bugs me the most about the car is the transmission. The 5-speed automatic is counterintuitive, sloppy shifting, has a tendency to hunt for gears, and rarely puts you in the correct gear required for the situation. I guess I could have went for the manual but my options were limited at the time of purchase. The gears are all spaced very close together and it always shifts too early, cutting off power and denying me a large reserve of the advertised 306 horses. In stop-and-go traffic, the transmission shifts through its entire gearset during the 10 feet you’ve moved up in traffic and annoyingly holds the gears long after you’ve let off the accelerator, like you’re “stuck” in the gear. On the highway it revs at over 3,000 RPM because of the tight spacing between all the gears, making you think you were driving a 3-speed automatic. The shifting can also get pretty violent which makes driving this car a headache. Another thing that bugs me is the engine performance. Doesn’t have a linear or predictable torque curve. It’s very soft on low-end torque and needs to be revved out a great deal to keep up with other cars on the road. Engine is very loud and course sounding and because of the sloppy powerband it’s not really so much of a joy to ring out either. Most mainstream cars have more smooth, predictable acceleration and meaty grunt off the line. G35 does not have that and other cars on the road will be going faster from stop light to stop light than you. Often times I find myself missing that smooth, seamless, meaty, refined feel that my old Volkswagen had even though that car had a fraction of the horsepower. The steering feels artificially heavy, like they tried to go after BMW’s chunky/hefty steering feel but instead they put effort over feedback. Steering doesn’t feel predictable or communicative..just simply difficult to turn which hampers the maneuverability. Doesn’t have a good on-center feel and the steering doesn’t always give you a good idea of what the front tires are doing. Turning radius could definitely be better. The brakes are soft and don’t provide much confidence or linear stopping power. They feel like Sentra brakes...or maybe even a step below that. I’ve tested the brakes and the car the stopping distance is very long compared to other cars I’ve had in the past. You need to keep a big distance from other cars in front of you because the brakes probably won’t save you in a panic situation, which I find somewhat unacceptable in any modern day vehicle, especially a sport sedan. The cornering abilities are disappointing. It feels very heavy in the corners and makes you (along with your loose items in the vehicle) feel like you’re being sucked into a vortex around a slight bend in the road. After exiting the turn and getting back on the gas, literally 99% of the time the transmission won’t put you in the correct gear to propel the vehicle back up to speed.The car just drives very amateurish. While everything operates as it should going down the road, the car behaves very stubbornly and leaves much to be desired. On top of everything, the gas mileage will empty your pockets. While the vehicle has made it to 60,000 miles, I could see it needing transmission/drivetrain and suspension repairs in the future. These components of the vehicle simply feel very low-rent feel to them and I don’t see them standing the tests of time. Material quality and ergonomics are also seriously lacking. I’ve seen car interiors from the ‘90s hold up better. Storage solutions are lacking and the armrests are practically useless. My advice if buying this car is don’t be fooled by the advertised 306 horses. The car certainly doesn’t feel like it was built properly for that kind of power, and you rarely ever get to use them. Maybe skip the “X” and go for the RWD “S” model with the manual and the active 4 wheel steering...",,

5,I made the best investment,nadia ,11/17/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I was sketchy about the price but i test drove this car once and bought it the same day. I love everything about the car! Feels like I am in a grand luxury car whenever I drive it. I have leather seats and a sunroof which is great for the hot and humid Florida weather. The exhaust sounds like a bad ass (: when turning on and driving off with the car. The power is strong. Gas mileage is horrible, but listen to the other posts, its WORTH it ! The tire to road frequency is great. Tires grip the road beautifully. Boast and sound system is not that loud hearing music from the outside, but the inside sounds good. I get about 20-30 mpg on the hwy and about 19-20 on the road. I'm a female so I don't drive harshly or roughly. My car has black stripes and is silver and I get so much compliments from it. I have 99665 miles on it and it drives like new. Maintenance is so expensive that is a con! If u cannot afford it, don't buy an Infiniti! Repair is not a big issue because I have not replaced much yet except for my hoses and battery  which is about 140 altogethor And that's it. After 100k drive belts and fluids are needed to be changed 8 years later and that's it.  Hopefully it will last another decade. Brakes don't last very long and they are very expensive when u go to the dealer !!! But other then that once u drive you'll feel very confident with the car because its so perfect.  I shoudlve gave the car interior three stars because the steering wheel chips and looks nasty so I put a cover on it and the doors are chipping and scratched on the drivers side so be gentle when it comes to cleaning products. Water works just fine.  The seats are so perfect. I wipe them with water and that's it. They are so climate controlled but I think because its leather and thseres a switch to warm up that seats when its cold . A/C works beautifully . another con is that my car is sooooo low !!!! When going over bumps, u must be cautious because I could hear the scratching noise under the car! Even when going slowly. Thank god under the car has a covering. After I'm done financing I'm going for a q45 or q50 which is an extension of g35/37",,

4.75,Exactly what I wanted and more,av125009 ,02/11/2015,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"Got this car to replace a totalled '02 bmw 325xi. Shopping for cars was a real disappointment, everything was either too underpowered or too expensive. Infiniti's value blew me away; I test drove a 2008 g35 and bought it later that day. Sure, the Germans make a smoother ride, but the g35 is quicker. The 306HP V6 is a blast to drive and its interior is feature rich and well designed. The nav system is very intuitive and well designed, especially the steering wheel controls. Rear wheel drive gives it a great sporty feel but is useless in the snow without proper tires. The gas mileage is terrible, I get about 13 mpg in the city. oh well, its worth it.","The infotainment/nav system. Its so good that Infiniti uses virtually the same one in their new models. Backup camera= Awesome. You can keep the key in your pocket at all times; it has a proximity sensor that unlocks the ignition when the key is in the car. I know the ""sport mode"" is kind of a cheesy feature but its a lot of fun on windy roads.  If you take traction control off you can do a burnout; the best feature of the car is honestly the engine. The embroidered Infiniti logos on the leather seats and the silver trim give the interior some nice touches.","I can be very picky about sound and the Bose system didn't really do it for me. It's not bad by any means, but its not mind blowing either. The ""subwoofer"" was punchy and lacked depth. Its other shortcomings were the standard complaints about bose. My suggested improvement is to install two 10"" JL's which is what i did. having a proper sub in it was night and day in terms of sound quality.   "

5,My first real investment pays off...,ebbandblow ,10/22/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"First of all, WOW. This car captured my eye from the moment I spotted it during my search for the best car in my price range. At first what really got me into it was it's stock 306hp V-6! And good thing because if it were not for it having a more powerful engine than the Acura TL Type S, I would have never even considered this car as an option. Now moving onto the inside (where I really fell in love with the car) you see a gorgeous speed/tach gauge setup with a barrage of buttons all with the perfect touch of accent lighting. Not to mention just about any tech feature you can fit into a sport sedan (even if you don't opt for the tech. package.) Continued below","As for the trim on the inside, it is fantastic. You get perforated leather bucket seats in the front. And a darn comfortable rear leather bench seat for consideration to your passengers. The aluminum trim on the dash is just sexy, period. Basically, the interior is tops for a car in this price range. And last I give you the performance... hehehe. Let's just say, 0-60 no problem! 0-100 sure, why not?! Pass this guy doing 30 in a 60mph zone with a steady stream of cars zipping by on each side. Just look for a minor gap and hammer it down. You'll get in :) I'll be using the ""Suggested improvements"" section for more positives... ","As for the ride comfort, well my neck has been getting used to the power in this car so I have been straining a bit. I am used to a 93 honda accord so this is a HUGE step up. The seats are just wonderful though. You sort of mold into them when you get up to speed and it just feels, right. Then there is the cars handling. Even at high speeds this car just grips the road as if its life depends on it. And the steering is sharp and responsive but it will get very stiff when you get up to speed. So my advice, if you want a fun and sexy car, look no further. Turn your traction control off and enjoy the ride. Last thing, if you are heavy-set, DON'T get the sport package. The seats are very narrow."

It is comfortable, quiet, has a killer Bose sound system, and handles fantastic. I had the same engine in my Maxima but you not know it here.

I've always liked the looks of the G35 so I decided to test drive one. It was all over after that. WOW is all I had to say. I bought the 08 early this year because of the rebates, only paid 32K for it with the Sport and Premium packages. I still have my 03 Maxima which I like alot but I let my sister drive it for now because I just can't see letting it sit (and sit it would as long as I have a car like the G). The VLSD (vicious limited-slip differential) and paddle shifters add to the FUN factor for sure. I'm 29 and feel like a kid in a candy store every time I get in my car.",Just about everything. The power is amazing and handling just compliments it. Just step on it and hang on!! Stereo is great(Bose) and interior features are simple to use after you read what all you can do in the owners manual. ,The only thing that comes to mind here would be the fuel economy but I can say that it is 100% my own fault I don't get better MPG.

Rubbish.  This car is quicker, sexier, and cheaper than its German counterpart.  Plus, I haven't even got to the interior.  Driving a BMW is like driving something an engineer built to a specification.  Driving the G35 is like something a engineer designed and then an interior designer architect and artist redesigned.  Its performance characteristics are superb, but more importantly, the car engages you.  Its beautiful curves and attention to design and detail creates an experience.  Remember, we (as humans) like things that look like us.  The car looks like a supermodel.",Styling.  The cabin creates a pleasant and engaging experience. Mad crazy amounts of power.  ,"It's nice to have a hard drive, but it is of no practical use.  You can't copy MP3s, and you cannot transfer files using the compact flash card.

I had a great deal on the 2008 vs. a 2009 so I decided to pull the trigger. I love the interior, and the color scheme. The Premium package is a must. I like the G35S but at $2200 more, I decided to go without. I love the way it looks, and the manu-shifting is great. Not as instantaneous as a 6MT, but I rarely race, if ever. All in all, would definitely do it again. Didn't care much for the navigation (already have an awesome $200 Garmin) and the CF slot. With an iPod and an MP3 CD player, who needs CF?","1.

Fun to Drive!!,OnebadTKE ,03/09/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have been looking at the usual culprits in this class of vehicle for about 2 1/2 months now -- BMW, Lexus and Infiniti (both M35 and G35). I LOVED the G35 from the time I sat down until the time I left the dealership last!  To get the MOST enjoyment from the car, I definitely recommend the Sport option for the added bonus of the seat upgrade!  Granted the different sized tires may be a problem for some, but I have had to buy sport tires on my last 2 vehicles so am used to the cost!  Regardless of some of the other ""complaints"" on the car, the gas mileage is a non-issue...unless you are coming from a Honda Civic or Mini- Cooper! 20 MPG city/25-28 MGH HWY is great for a PERFORMANCE SEDAN","Sport seats; NavTeq Navigation system is AWESOME (read the manual to find that all of the important controls are NOT locked out... use the VOICE feature); Xenon lights; Ipod adapter; the ""growl"" of the engine; the exterior lines of the car are seductive!","Only thought...

I waited out the lease on my previous vehicle, then searched for more than a month to find a 6spd Sport.  I live in upstate NY and took delivery in late November at the start of snow season; after nearly 2 months, I have no regrets about buying RWD.  A set of Blizzaks all around, plus VDC and a light touch on the throttle and clutch, and I haven't had a problem at all.  The G is everything I wanted; stylish, sophisticated, RWD, 6MT, with all the tech gadgets I could ask for.  A friend rode in it and commented ""Nice, but not a BMW or Audi.""  Which is exactly why I bought it.","Styling, intoxicating power, 6 spd, RWD. Sport model when every other G I've seen has X AWD.

Each had similar driving characteristics, but I ended up with the G35 because of the value of the content for the price. Living in Minnesota, the AWD feature was important, and the addition of the Premium, Navigation and Sport packages the price just couldn't be beat.  Great linear acceleration with the right sounds. Sticky in the corners with the granny system on, but easy hang the rear out when you turn it off. Beautiful looks outside, nice inside. AWD is great in the winter with the all-seasons.  The nav system is restricted from most functions when the car is in motion thanks to the lawyers - really annoying.","Once programmed, nav is great especially with the traffic feature from XM. Seven ways to play music and three ways to control all screen functions (knob, touch screen and steering wheel. Beautiful exterior styling.

I live in MN so an AWD or FWD vehicle was a must. I test drove the following vehicles prior to my choice of the g35x. Honda Accord Coupe, Nissan Maxima, Lexus IS250 awd, Lexus ES350, and Nissan Altima. The G35 was a combination of all the vehicles and really offers the power and luxury which could not be surpassed by any of the aforementioned vehicles.  I drive in Minneapolis rush hour daily and the snow mode comes in quite handy when the weather takes a turn for the worst. I constantly try to lose control in this vehicle on secluded country roads and it's almost impossible.","Too many to name: interior is simple yet modern. Power, 306 hp in a 3500 lb car makes things move quickly. HID lights. Seat Memory feature. 18"" wheels. IPod interface.",Fuel Economy. I get 20 mpg with mixed city/highway driving. The mileage goes down slightly in snow mode. Dashboard rattle. The dashboards ability to raise and lower according to driver preference is great but I get a bit of rattling coming from the dash. 
4.875,A Pleasure to Drive,Rob ,12/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is for people who love to drive.  Acceleration is fantastic.  Handling and braking are smooth.  Very tight turning radius for a car this size.  Road noise is a little more prevalent than in competitor's models, but not bad overall.  You can feel the transmission shifts a bit.  This car has a lot of power for a 5-speed.  Likely corrected with the 7-speed in the '09.  For me, the MPG has been trending at 17 over the first two months of ownership.  I'm a little on the aggressive side, but previous cars haven't penalized me as much as this one does.","The design team paid such attention to detail, it's amazing.  They truly make this car.  The way the acceleration truly feels like a tidal wave as advertized, all of the buttons feel the same.  Keyless entry and trunk.  Snow mode is very good (I live in Chicago and have used it a lot this week.)","Auto headlamps turn off too quickly, even adjusting the sensitivity.  Gas mileage.  Fold down back seats!  I do kinda miss those.  Sound system needs more customization -- bass and treble only?!?  A dedicated electrical port, not inside the ash tray."

I'm battling with Nissan with a suspension, steering or tracking problem as this car is way too sensitive to road crown compared to every car I've driven, it drives straight in the right lane but would crash into the woods next to the left lane as soon as the hands are off the steering wheel, after alignment done on it 3 times, Nissan is refusing to acknowledge this quality defect while all 3 of their loaner cars I've driven drove without this problem, I would trade it in for an AWD especially living in the NE, a RWD just won't cut it in snow.  It's worse than a Maxima SE, don't waste your money","Sound sys, keyless remote","Straighten up steering, fix shaky gearbox, transmission heating up your leg, shaky shift nob.

Frustrated, dumped it in 08, too many trips to the shop!  Looked at the Maxima (never a fan, but liked the new look in 09) LOVED it, but couldn't pay $37K--more than the G. Drove the G, power kicks the 325.  Who needs this sort of power?  The brakes, lovely, the growl, exhilarating and no tranny lag when punched.  Smooth, sure footed (though not as much on mountain roads as the BMW) and quiet.  The drive train hump encroaches into the foot-well so front passenger's left leg/foot tilts at an odd angle. Front doors close solidly, rear doors sound tinny.",I really think the exterior design is gorgeous. I love the dash colors and that the steering column moves up and out of the way while the seat moves back for easy entrance and exit.  ,"No rain sensing wipers? No power retractable mirrors? Seat heaters are wimpy. Cruise control lags & and setting it is fussy. BMW's system is much easier.

Where would you use your navigation system, in your driveway? The car allows you to sync your phone book from your cell phone to the car but you can't use the sync phone book to place calls while driving. When would you use this, in your driveway again!

If you're looking at this car, I highly recommend the navigation package as the Music Box hard drive (stores music to the car) is a great feature.

5,Enjoying it ad infinitum,Rick ,08/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought it over a month ago and have been extremely pleased with it. I was initially in the market for the A4 and test drove it couple of times. Although the A4 drives well, the 08 model felt a little cramped even in the front. The Infiniti dealership was right next door, so decided to stop in to test drive the G35. Was sold on it instantly. Great handling and power, not to speak of luxurious and (relatively) roomy interior. Reminded me of my friend's 924 that I used to occasionally drive couple of decades ago.

G35 was a much tighter drive and the exterior lines are much better and more unique.  Only had for two weeks, but to date, I am very happy with the car.

The new G is slicker and more ""refined""--the automotive press had complained that the previous version was lacking in this department.  Acceleration is effortless at any speed, in any gear.  Handling is tight and predictable.  Some luxury buyers may find that the ride is a bit stiffer than they like.  However, the G does not pretend to be a Lexus - this is a sports sedan.  I've driven everything else out there, including various offerings from BMW, Audi, Lexus, Acura, Mercedes, etc.  Hands down, the G is the best sports sedan for the money which is why I'm on my second one.

As a driver who spends almost all of his time in stop-and-go driving, the gas mileage is a little subpar (17-18 mpg in the city, but much better on the highway).

I did a lot of research and test driving (Lexus IS 350, BMW 335i), but I was always partial to the Infiniti G35. I love the exhaust note!! This was a no brainer. The Lexus and Bimmer were $7k and $10k more respectively with the same options. I got mine fully loaded.  The car has wicked acceleration!

Tight suspension, steering, incredible features, fun to drive. Gas mileage is really bad but I don't care because every time I drive this car the smile on my face is priceless, acceleration is amazing and even though this car is extremely heavy, it hides it's pounds.

The Passat and the Murano were nice but not in the same level, the Lexus was heavy and at times I almost had to shake the car to move, and the BMW though handled well, wasn't as much fun as driving this or even half as decently equipped. This car impressed me from the get go. It handled well on the curves and on the straight line. It is smooth to drive, and I can hit 75 effortlessly.

I also needed something for winter. I will say I'm really surprised by how responsive the automatic 306HP of the sedan deploys itself. Having said that, I HIGHLY recommend anyone getting this car to the G35xS, which adds the 18"" wheels and the paddle shifters. I will say the car comes to life when in manual mode, much differently then just driving in automatic.  With that I will say I'm quite happy and the car now provides the same confidence my previous G did.","Push button start, nice nav display, comfortable seats, dual intakes with upgrade to stillen long pipes (extra 10hp, 9 ft lbs of torque), premium stereo.","The ability to change the satellite channels one at a time on steering wheel, not just the genre or music source.

Can't go wrong with a G.","Overall performance, engine/RWD/6MT, handling, seat comfort and adjustability, Touch-screen nav, iPod interface, styling inside and out, two-tone stone interior.","I'm nitpicking, but... better small storage in front seat area (especially cupholders), delete 6CD changer from trunk, offer better exterior color options (so boring!), add 19"" wheels and G37 coupe exhaust sound to Sport model"
5,Best Decision Ever,crushut07 ,05/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I went through an exhausting research process to decide on a car. I read every review, and drove more cars than I can count. Eventually, I narrowed it down between the '08 Accord Coupe w/ Nav, Audi A4 3.2 Quattro, BMW 3 Series, and only had the G35 left to drive. After I drove the Infiniti, I realized there was no comparison. The power, handling, and comfort are incomparable, and the price is incredibly reasonable for such an awesome car. I have people compliment my car everywhere I go!","The power, push-button start, navigation system, integrated phone and iPod, and overall interior and exterior styling.","Gas mileage might be a turn off for some, but you should realize you are getting a performance car. Also, the 6 disc changer in the trunk is annoying."

Beyond the looks of the car, the performance of the sedan is unbelievable. Choosing between the 3 Series and the G35 was a no brainer once I got behind the wheel of the Infiniti!","The navigation is clear and easy to use. I also love the push-button start, back-up camera, iPod adapter, crystal clear radio, and the response of the car when you push the accelerator.","Gas mileage is a concern, but you have to know that you are getting a performance vehicle, not a gas-sipper. The only improvements I can think of is adding automatic door-locks and having the six-disc changer in the dash instead of the trunk."

I was impressed by all the extras and once I drove it, it was a sale. Awesome vehicle for the family and I have pre teenagers. My oldest son is very tall and it's a tad bit head bumping when you go across a hump, but it is fun, sporty, luxurious, simply perfection. I've owned a civic, accord, prelude, saturn, expedition, suburban, mustang, quest... no comparison. I'm in love with my vehicle. I'm averaging 20-no compliants from me!

4.875,This car is very smooth,Turner ,04/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"From the first time I saw this car at the dealership, it caught my eye. This sedan is well built and provides a classy but yet sporty look while delivering performance with a modern interior. The performance is awesome and so much fun to drive but what makes this car is the interior in my mind. It's not as luxury as the Lexus but it's 10K less too. It makes the BMW interior look childish. I would definitely suggest going with the Navigation and Premium Package. If you want a smoother/softer ride, don't get the sport package. But the sport package is nice and delivers in a great way. I guess it's all about what you want. All I can say is, go test drive one. Infiniti is here and with a great car.","By far my favorite feature is the navigation. Wonderful and so easy to use. I also love the paddle shifters and how much performance they provide. Bluetooth, door handle remote sensor, backup camera, iPod port and Bose radio sounds great. Too many positives to list here. ",I would say gas mileage but look at all the other comparable cars that provide the same performance and tell me what gas mileage they have. This is a performance sedan folks.

I really wanted the RWD version but wife wanted the AWD (I also wanted the 6MT but wife cannot drive stick).  Steering is slightly heavy at low speed.  Fun to corner at the exit ramp and interior feels very luxurious with the luxury option and nav.  Nav however tells you weird, roundabout directions.

ONE test drive in the G35x and it was a done deal! The dealer let me keep one over a weekend and I didn't want to give it back! Purchased the S option with paddle shifters. Talk about fun!!  This weekend drove 70 miles to and from my father's house for the holiday: and if my wife had told me she left something (anything) back at my father's house I would have repeated the trip instantly just for fun!

4.75,What a car!,Maniac ,03/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I have owned quite a few sedans over the years and this one is my favorite by far.    I just traded in my Dodge Charger R/T for this 2008 G35X (w/ Premium & Nav), and I have to say this sedan absolutley kills my dodge in every way (including performance).  Being a computer consultant, I love all of the technology packed into the car. Voice commands actually work like you expect them to, the backup camera is awesome, iPod integration rocks.  I could go on and on.  Performance is great for a sedan like this.  Faster than my hemi dodge for sure.  The AWD is amazing and seamless.  I feel like I'm driving a RWD with LOADS of grip.  Much safer for my wife to drive in the wet and snow!","AWD - I almost insisted that I get the RWD version, but the dealer talked me into AWD and I dont regret it one bit. The system is RWD until slip is detected, the best of both worlds!  Performance - 5.4 0-60, 13.8 quarter mile!  What else can you say.  Tech - nothing better in its class!","Fuel economy.  I average 18 mpg.  But I wouldnt change a thing if it meant giving up the performance.  Size.  The car is a little snug for a bigger guy (6'0"" 300lbs) but still comfy."
4.75,Not one regret,docmartin2 ,03/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Bought the G35x last month and absolutely love it.

I was looking for a fun sporty car and this is exactly that, but with a lot of luxury thrown in as well.  It's comparable to the BMW 335i (better IMHO) in performance, comfort, and luxury.  It has virtually all the luxury features of $50k+ luxury cars.  If you're looking for a car that's fun to drive, the G35 is unrivaled.  And it fits 5 people comfortably too!  The clutch is stiff but easy to get used to.  And I strongly suggest spending the extra 5k to get the nav.  All the features that comes with it are awesome! I wish I got the tech package.","Performance! Fast, great handling, stops on a dime, 6-speed short shifter.  Music hard drive, mp3, voice commands, bluetooth, completely keyless, windows can open with keyfob. The interior looks really fancy.  ","Make back seats able to fold down! I can't take this car snowboarding (very sad).  The sound system could use convenience improvements: add equalizer, allow direct mp3 download, rip mp3s at higher quality.

Feels more solid behind the wheel, nice more muscular look, and the 306 hp really gives you a buzz.  This is the best mid-size sedan on the market, and for the money one of the best sedans period.  This is my 5th Infiniti and never anything other than routine maintenance on the others. Expect the same on this one.  Check this one out for sure!!!","306 hp engine, push button start, sound system is great, performance tire package, good looking exterior, comfortable ride, hands free system.","Bigger trunk would be nice, and it would be great to get 30mpg, but we know what we're getting when get into one of these!"

The power is excellent and handles the road with ease. I can't say I test drove any of the other comparable cars but I didn't get that far because the G35 was the first car I drove and I was sold instantly. I went all out and got the Sport/Navigation/Premium package with the spoiler. I love the spoiler. It adds a perfect but not tacky touch. The technology is awesome and I feel like I'm in a space rocket. To me, this car looks best with a black exterior but that's just my opinion.","By far my favorite feature is the whole interior. Absolutley amazing. Nice layout, quality materials and beautiful styling. I also love the navigation. It's one of the best I've seen and operated. Of course I love the keyless entry and and iPod hookup as well.","Why doesn't the sport interior come with the tan option? I would say gas mileage but come on, this is a sports sedan."

The interior is just below Lexus level, but not by much. The premium navigation/commmunications package is truly wonderful. The engine has rocketship thrust, even if it's a little unrefined compared to BMW, Lexus and Audi. I have been averaging 20 mpg on the highway, and am driving like a regular guy-- nothing too crazy, and not like Grandpa. If you can, get the sports package just for the seats if nothing else. Bar raised!",One feature I like is the onboard hard drive; put in your CD and the music downloads to the HD. The CDs can then live in your living room not the car,Engine refinement/noise intrusion.

Nothing can touch a Bimmer coursing through the S curves but my new G 35S is a powerful sedan that hopefully will provide years of satisfaction.  This car is simply gorgeous and packs more technological features that cars costing many thousands more. I am very satisfied with my purchase.","306 throaty horses, LSD, sport design, hard drive, magnesium paddle shifters, sport seats, steering wheel.",Fuel consumption leaves much to be desired but I knew this going in.

My G35S is fully loaded with aftermarket chrome detail work. Since my purchase I have been ecstatic and have woken up everyday with a smile on my face. The interior is exceptional in both design and comfort. With more standard luxury options and equipment than the 328, such as HID Xenon headlights, leather upholstery, and keyless entry with push-button start. Bottom line, if you can live without the prestigious German nameplate, the best value for your money is the Infiniti G35 Sport 6MT. ","The standard luxury features that would cost extra money on other nameplates (BMW, Audi, etc.) such as leather seating and 18"" premium wheels. The adaptive headlight system which synchronizes the wheels with the headlights. The V6 306HP, sport suspension, and best of all, the rear view camera.","Subtle changes to exterior detailing, improved MPG, more responsive traction for winter, bigger trunk or folding rear seats, bigger storage units/glovebox, less engine and transmission vibrations/noise, and actually making models equipped with the 4 Wheel Active Steer Package(you cannot find this).

It's a great car with an excellent engine, nice interior, great exterior, all the gadgets and a posh sound system. But it has several HUGE flaws - horrible transmission and clutch!  First of all it is VERY hard to launch it smoothly and quetly, too much throttle and it surges like a bull, too little and it shakes like its got an overdose. Let go throttle at 1st gear and instead of slow smooth engine braking you get uneven and abrupt deceleration, horrible feeling (and you look like a fool too). Second - very LOUD drivetrain noise. Third - under hard acceleration the car starts to shake violently, as the tires gain and loose the grip, very disappointing.","I can't understand how did I live without the rear view camera before! A HUGE plus! IPod integration, POWER of course (could use a little more), brakes, interior design/materials, sound system, beautifull and supportive seats, amazingly direct steering, wonderful (but too muted) exhaust note. ","FIX the clutch, drivetrain noise and transmission gear lever vibration and engagement clarity. Better gas mileage (I get 13 mpg in NYC), more storage room upfront, fix the BIG problem with the tires going crazy under full throttle (may be wider tires?) Bigger boot opening.

4.875,2008 Infiniti G35 is a perfect combo,Carter ,02/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought the 2008 Infiniti G35 with the Premium/Nav/Sport packages. This is by far the most fun car I've ever had the pleasure to drive. From the excellently designed body to the excellently detailed interior, this car has it all.  It has a wonderful balance of luxury and sport mixed together. The interior is fantastic with the sport package if you like the more modern feel. If you like the luxury feel more, I would not get the sport package because the seats are firm but very solid.  If you want a better performance, you need to get the sport package. Either way, this car is such a wonderful balance of both worlds. Excellent car!  ",Driving/performance: This car has very tight and responsive steering. The throttle response is instant.  Navigation and Tech Package are a must. So many options and features that add so much to this excellent designed interior. The navigation is some of the best I've even seen and so simple to use,"Keep in mind when I say improvements, that I am a perfectionist. Brakes could be a little firmer and gas mileage could be better but folks, this is a performance sedan. Be realistic. I would rather have the power when I need it and trade gas mileage for responsiveness"
4.625,Muy Excellente,t ham ,02/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"AMAZING engine with immediately ready torque and speed. With this comes less than average fuel economy and that is ok, you can't have both.  I think it's doing around 18 overall, and for those of you who ride about 5-8 mph over the speed limit, you'll be at 3200rpm at 75 mph. Like I said, it's the trade off you get for such a hungry engine. I'm not sure if a 6th gear would fix this, but I think that may make this car perfect. The tan leather with real wood trim is very rich looking. Easy to use nav & controls. Simply put, it's the most fun car I've ever driven and it's not even close - add Japanese reliability for icing on the cake. Bravo Infiniti.","9 gig hard drive for music.  This is simply the future of car audio - no more fumbling with cd cases. Exhaust note is almost arousing.  Engine is simply amazing, handling is excellent while ride remains very good (18s with journey suspension is a perfect combination of comfort/sport), fit and finish.",COMPLETELY POINTLESS 6 disc changer in trunk - robs space and is simply a dumb idea with hard drive and single disc player in dash. Different sized tires on front and rear prevent rotation. Steering wheel audio control (track up/down) is backwards. That's pretty much it. Standing Ovation Infiniti.

It's also great that I got a great deal on it.  You get so much for your money with this car.  I got the Premium Package and the Nav. Package and think they're both great.  I had debated buying the car without the Nav. package and then buying a portable device but I'm happy I went with the built-in as they tie in so many other things to it.

I've really gotten to like not having to hassle with the key; just leave it in your pocket and start the car, lock and unlock doors, etc.","Okay, okay, the gas mileage isn't what it should be but I saved so much on the car I can afford the gas.

This was my dream car and I found a way to get it.  This car packs more features then any car I have ever seen, and for the price completely knocks out BMW, Lexus, and Audi.  I had test driven every single car in the class from the 325xi, Lexus IS350, Caddy CTS, and Audi S4.  I have to say without a doubt the G35 is hands down the best car.  Infiniti rocks!","Everything.

I traded in a 2007 Maxima SE and haven't looked back since.  My G35 turns heads and at takeoff will pin your head back. I wish I could find a raceway so that I can really stretch it out.

Though it may be a personal preference but pictures do not do justice to the lines and form of this car (like flowing water caught in an instant).  Roomy inside (for this segment) and comfortable without excess.  Premium and Navigation packages are a must.  This is not a super-car but its highly capable and not overpriced.  You can judge for yourself - definitely take a test drive.,One of the best AWD systems - %100 to the rear on dry pavement. Near perfect weight balance for dynamic but predictable handling.

Better cup holders and center arm rest (position and storage wise). Tweak the throttle response not to get bogged down or go into all-out launch from standing start.

Mine is the Journey with Tech package, Premium luxury package, sport wheels and Rosewood interior.  The combo of the Journey suspension with the 18 inch sport wheels/tire are the perfect balance for comfort and performance in my opinion.
