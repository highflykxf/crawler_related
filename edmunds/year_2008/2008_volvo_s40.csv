5,Love my Volvo S40 b/c it is reliable and strong,Courtney B. ,02/18/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,4,4,,,"I bought my 2008 S40 Volvo used in 2009.  I love this car.  It has a few quirks.  First, the radio was super stylish in 2009, but now I wish it was easier to upgrade.  Second, it goes through batteries.  I haven't had the tire issues others complain of.  The REALLY good news is that I've been in two accidents and just shook them off.  Someone plowed into me and you can barely tell.  It's got that Volvo strength.  Second, I haven't had any mechanical issues.  I get it looked at by the dealer once a year, but outside of tire and battery replacements, I haven't had to deal with anything beyond regular upkeep.  I love this car and I want to keep it forever, assuming I can figure out a way to upgrade the radio.  It's so reliable.",,
3.25,Too many problems for the cost,chicommuter ,01/29/2012,,,4,4,4,2,,3,4,2,3,"I purchased this car in 2011 with only 16,000 miles and had it back in the shop within 3 weeks to fix the driver side door which wouldn't latch.Subsequently have had it in the shop twice (wouldn't start due to programming issue and grinding noise while cornering).Now have to replace all tires @ 30k miles which the shop told me is common for this model.",,
4.25,Great car for the value,topgeardreams ,01/12/2011,,,5,4,4,4,,4,4,5,4,"Recently picked up my 08 S40 T5 AWD. Compared to competition the value is great; higher rate ofdepreciation means this is a good used car to pick up (if you're planning on keeping it for a while). You would have to pay much more for similar Legacy GT or Audi A4. Handling is better than most sedans, but not as tight as an A4 in the steering or suspension. Good enough for spirited driving. While climbing mtn passes turbo seems to make more than ample power on my way to Tahoe. Acceleration isn't great either at low or midrange. (Tranny on auto keeps revs low, so using the tiptronic helps) On snow and ice the Haldex type awd system performs almost invisibly. Overall a very good buy. 24mpg avg","Quiet at speed. Interior is gorgeous and seats are best I've ever owned. Storage space is sufficient. Trunk is a bit shallow but rear seats drop down. Sirius radio is great. Controls are logical well placed, and pretty. the lights are confusing; they're always on! Can't turn off daytime lights. Love the interior fabric.
Haldex part time awd system doesn't seem to be an issue for an avg driver; if I were looking for a racer this wouldn't be it; the slip angles would reduce cornering efficiency. But, the auto engagement of awd suits most normal use needs. I read somewhere system will even go to full diff lockout as needed; pretty impressive.","If I were to change anything it'd be wider tires or stiffer sway bars; car could corner a bit tighter.
I have stock 16"" rims so that could be the problem. Acceleration isn't great which is why the newer models have 6 spd auto's. A sport mode would help to keep the revs up closer to the peak powerband.
More compartments to store stuff up front would be nice; but the 08's aren't bad. I heard pre-08's have very little storage options."

3.625,unexpected,Martin ,10/28/2010,,,4,5,4,2,,4,3,3,4,"The car is good looking and runs well out on the road. However, we've experienced problems with this car like no other new car we've ever owned.  Had to replace rotors at approx. 18K miles. Not covered under warranty.  Had to have car aligned at 22K and replace tires as result of bad alignment.  Toed out and cupped tires which caused a terrible road roar.  Battery went dead at 2 yrs.  The only thing covered by the 4 yr warranty was the battery.  Expensive car to own.  Will never buy another Volvo.  Rough ride in the back seat(s).",Car's appearance and style.,"From what I've heard, alignment issues are common with the S40.  Eats up tires and won't hold an alignment.  Must be a design problem that needs to be resolved."
4.5,"Great looking, reliable, average car",Ted ,07/07/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"Have been driving this car for over 2 years now. Love the overall look and build quality. Very different from other cars on the road.  A few issues, fuel economy, loud interior, and surprisingly more than one blind spot due to the large columns (it's a safety thing...I get it)  The drive is also not as European as I would have expected from a car competing with the likes of BMW, Audi and dare I say it, VW. It lacks that little oomph to get it at the same level as its German competitors.  It doesn't get me excited, it gets me from A to B in style and safely.",Interior and exterior looks. Reliability. Solid build. ,Steering responsiveness Fuel economy more of a German feel Rear space
4.25,Nice But Expensive,Pat ,07/07/2010,,,5,5,4,1,,5,4,5,5,"This car has been really good up till lately.  I purchased this vehicle brand new with only 2 miles on it; now I am at 45,380 miles. Within the last month... Navigation quit working - dealer had to order a whole new head unit for it... Strange & Annoying rattle in the passenger side door - ended up being loose rivets that hold the window in the door.  They also did some software update as well.  This was all covered under warranty.  This car never seems to hold an alignment.  Just home today from having the 3rd alignment since I got this car new.  This is the first vehicle I have ever had to do a alignment on.  Hopefully the third time is a charm.  ","Fun to drive, acceptable power with the T5, interior design.",Bigger trunk would be nice.  On the AWD trunk space is very limited.  Cheaper maintenance would be a bonus; major service intervals can run as high as $600.  Less problems - at 45K I am starting to see way too many ridiculous issues.  
4.875,small but cool,URSUS ,06/22/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I bought the S40 couple months ago and i like it ..European car always the best ..,Sound system is excellent .., a little extra leg room in the back seat would be fantastic. 
5,2008 S40 easy choice after accident,Jeff ,02/02/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Last year a huge chunk of steel fell off a truck and bounced into my lane while I was traveling about 60mph on an interstate. My 2006 S40 was totaled but I only had a sore back for a couple of weeks. Having been an auto appraiser for 6 years I consider myself an expert on assessing damage. I am sure I would have had a major injury in most other cars of any size. I was so impressed with the way the car took the accident that my first choice was a 2008 S40. I have had my 2008 about a year now and love it!,Comfortable seats and sporty looks. The controls are well designed and not overly complex to use.,Add an inch of length to the front seats.
5,Great Euro Design,Chris from NJ ,10/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the S40 just as I was finishing college...it's a great car and I am very happy with it.  I went from a Toyota 4Runner(which I LOVE...if I could have both I would) and do not feel like I have lost much space.  It looks and drives great and accelerates beautifully.  Being 6'1"" I need to put my chair relatively far back, limiting the space behind my chair.  Therefore, if someone is sitting behind me, there is very little space.  That's my only issue.",The console...I love the space behind it.  And the very comfortable seats.,I think it would be great if the back windows went all the way down and a little extra leg room in the back seat would be fantastic.
4.25,"Sturdy, reliable ",CDY ,08/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,3,4,3,4,"Mileage is ok. Sporty ride. Not much space for the rear passengers. Small and sturdy. Noisy at low speeds. Got a dark grey car and black interior. great design even for cloth seats. Intuitive dials and controls. Nice programmable features like Autolock, rain sensing wipers, tail fog light, tow jack, homelink etc. ","Beautiful interior and very VOLVO-sh exterior. Nice Programmable features. CD player plays Mp3s. Ipod integratable, nice  nook for it too.",Blue Tooth. Full size spare. Information console and operation could be more intuitive. Grocery holds and hooks in the trunk.
5,Jeep to Volvo... what Jeep?,Chris G ,08/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Haven't loved a car this much in many moons.  Had a 2008 4 door Jeep Wrangler Sahara loaded.  Fun in summer.  Fun in winter.  An uncomfortable disaster the rest of the year.  Then... the Volvo S40.  WOW.  Fun ALL THE TIME! and looks and performs beautifully.  What a deal too.  Was an untitled demo.  Sticker $27K.  Bought it at $23K and they paid off my Jeep.  Why didn't I choose Volvo sooner???  Safe.  Stylish.  Fast.,The seats are amazing.  Sound system rocks.  Love the elegant simplicity of the cockpit.,Sunroof noise too much to talk on phone.
4.875,Love this CAR!!!,cwilsong ,06/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just finished one year with my S40 awd and I can say for the first time in a LONG time I really LOVE my car and feal I got a great deal as well.  Loads of power, fun to drive and very quiet. Probably even has a better sound system than I have at home.  Best part though was that we did an OSD and picked up the car direct from the factory. Not only got exactly the car I wanted at a better price than here but got to spend 3 weeks driving it around Europe.  If you are thinking about any Volvo you owe it to your self to look into OSD. Not all dealers push it as they get a fixed fee for handeling the sale but there are several Internet dealers out ther that can help you. ","Fit, Finish, Sound system, LOADS of power. VERY QUITE.  And just plain looks cool","Little more MPG.  And change how you go about replacing the cabin air filter, You have to remove the gas pedal. Takes over an hour to do it your self or $100.00 at the dealer."
5,Great Car,Jennifer ,05/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The VOLVO S40 AWD Tubo is awesome.  I enjoy every mile I have done so far. It drives well, handles well and is a attractive looking car.

4.625,The perfect cure for turning 30.,Cdydatzigs ,04/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"Growing up in the 1980's, Volvos were known as the boxy yuppy-mobiles that your hip friend's parents drove. Nowadays, the cars are still hip but they are far from boxy. The S40 is the perfect entry-level sports sedan for the post-college crowd. The car is very attractive but you can still tell the car is a vault under its skin. Huge door pillars and the comforting thud when the doors close tell you this is still one of the safest cars on the road. Materials inside are durable and attractive, and the controls are very easy to read. There is some turbo-lag off the line, but when yer cruising at 25 mph on the freeway on ramp and need to get to 75mph in a hurry? This car flies at mid-range.","Exterior looks fantastic. I feel very confident parking this car next to a BMW or Audi in the styling department. Interior is crisp, materials are durable and look great. Volvo dealer service is top notch. The customer service I have received is enough for me to stay loyal to Volvo for life","Manual transmissions are hard to find, which will change as buyers get younger hopefully. Fuel economy isn't spectacular for the car's size, even without the turbo. Rear brakes need replacing far too soon (15,000 miles for mine), due to their design to compensate for nosedives during hard braking. "
5,Volvo S40 - Highly recommended !!!,Dan ,04/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased a left over 2008 S40 about a month ago, mainly for my wife's use. What a car! We absolutely love it. We've both always owned domestic vehicles, but this one beats all of them in just about every way I can think of.  It has an overall great design, both inside and out. The comfort, feeling and handling of the car is superior than everything I have driven in the S40 price range.   Also impressed with crash test ratings. Now that we have experienced the quality of Volvo, I think it will be awhile until we go back to domestic. My vehicle is a Navigator, seriously thinking about trading it for a Volvo. Didn't think I would ever have considered that a few months ago!!", ,Backup sensors & keyless entry should be standard equipment.
5,Just Purchased,ericp ,02/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just purchased my S40 in Feb 09. I never thought of owning a Volvo but the dealer had this silver brand new 08, the sticker was $27,400. They let it go for $19,000 so how could I refuse. So far it is a very enjoyable car. Simple and very strong! I wish it had about 20 more HP, however it still is a wonderful car. ","Leather seats, styling inside, ease of controls.",Improve cup holders. Increase engine size to a 2.5 or 2.8.
5,VW Lover Falls for Volvo,atmf96 ,01/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I recently bought my first Volvo in Dec 08. This car is absolutely gorgeous, both inside and out. The exterior lines are very clean, and smooth. It gives the vehicle a sleek design, even sporty. It is easy to appreciate from all angles. And the interior is extremely comfortable. Leather seats are very soft and smooth, slightly fitted on the sides so you fit nice and snug. The layout of the console is simple yet robust. There isn't an abundance of knobs and dials to confuse you. In addition to great looks, the car drives great. It's very quiet at highway speeds, and the hi-performance audio sounds great. If you're looking for a sporty sedan, with clean looks inside and out, this is for you.","I love the interior design, the radio console controls are simple and elegant. It's very comfortable seated inside and to handle on the road. My S40 has great acceleration and turning control. The exterior design of the vehicle also looks gorgeous. This one definitely turns some heads.",
4.875,More Than Fair Value,Happy Pittsburgher ,09/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I narrowed onto this model as the best dollar value to replace one of our cars. While it does not have neck snaping acceleration, it is far from underpowered and it will snap your neck while cornering. Mileage on secondary roads is great, city is real good and highway if fantastic. Little negatives: no inside trunk relase or on the key fob and the doors do not automatically unlock when the key is removed.",Seats are the most comfortable I've ever owned. The feeling of security when the doors close must be felt.,Put a remote release for the trunk on the key fob and inside the car. Have the doors unlock when the key is removed.
4.75,Fantastic ,James ,06/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"This car is fantasic. I have the 5 cylinder 2.4i and I love it! It has more than enough power to speed my car up to equal that of anyother car on the road. I live in the north and it does wonderfully in the snow. Being a Volvo it is extremely reliable, and it perfect for the new driver in our family. It is my 16 year old's car and we feel very secure with him driving this car around. The car just has that safe feel about it: the doors are thick and heavy, there are numorius airbags and rides very smoothly. Interior is beautiful, the car is fully loaded and the sterio is louder than anyone could stand to hear. I believe this is the new luxury car.",Seats are very comfortable. Car is small and handles wonderfully. Audio system is fantastic. Interior styling is outstanding. Fast and Fun.,"Only one very small improvement, one of our other cars is a Mercedes and I have grown very used to the smoothness of that.

4.375,More than Impressed,phil ,04/08/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,4,3,"Unless your family is morbidly obese, the small foot-printed yet comfortable Volvo S40 is perfect the vehicle. The seats are best in any class and the rear leg room is adequate for people who didn't lose their legs. The driver foot well is a bit narrow, thus an automatic transmission version is recommended. Although the model is 4 yrs old, the face-lifted 2008 has finally done justice for the lines and shape of S40. Its beauty and sophisticated design is up to par with other just released 2008 cars. An attractive Volvo, what has our world come to?! Anyway, you buy Volvo for its comfortable road manner and silky smooth ride.  BMW is no longer exclusive b/c they are everywhere.",Interior design and comfortable seats. It is more comfortable than my massage chair. Ride quality. Overall car length is short which makes it easy to park in tight parking space.,Make the driver's side footwell wider for resting the left foot.  Bring the center console control higher. The 2.4i engine is acceptable but there is room for improvement.

But it handles snow and ice better than my SUV did.  Great handling and hugs the road- the car almost drives you. Interior is sophisticated and very comfortable. Congrats to Volvo for the sleek and modern body design.  This car feels solid unlike most small sedans out today.  For the quality, safety, and options found on this car you would have to pay thousands more if you bought another make. ",Body design; high quality leather seats; so many options!

I have only owned the Volvo for a month,  however I can say that this is a very solid automobile.  The ride and handling are excellent.  The AWD gives a feeling of being glued to the road. I used the vehicle during a recent New England snowstorm and the car did not slide at all.  There was never any wheel spin.  The fit and finish are second to none.  The leather seats are extremely comfortable and can be adjusted for a perfect fit.  The car is solid for a smaller vehicle. It feels as if; it is cut out of a single piece of Swedish steel.

People are often surprised when, at 26 years old, I tell them I purchased a Volvo - that is, until they see it. The Volvo name may carry the stigma of an ""old person's car"", but one look at the sleek design instantly extinguishes that thought. My black on black S40 turns heads and evokes positive reactions from family, friends, and co-workers. My expectations have been surpassed with this excellent vehicle.","Exterior styling, nimble handling, loads of features/amenities which come standard, sleek yet sophisticated interior styling, loads of safety features.","The ride could be smoother, and wind noise is prominent at times.

4.875,Great First Car,dcompain ,11/20/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my first new car after graduating college.  Before this I drove a 2002 E46 330i on occasion, but my own car was a 1986 BMW 635CSi.  As a BMW gearhead, I never saw myself in a Volvo, but the car represents an excellent value.  There is a lot of performance (I have 5-sp manual), style, comfort, and feature content for the money.  I have similar features as a BMW 328i for $10k less, and I actually enjoy the unique style, as a 3-series are a dime a dozen today.  The ride is very smooth while still delivering road-hugging performance.  As my first front-wheel-drive car, I appreciate the all-weather abilities as well.  ",Select package - Satellite radio with text display is excellent. Cold weather package - heated seats are a must. 5-M gearbox - small displacement non-turbo needs the stick to keep the revs up. Excellent seats. Balanced ride - good mix of sporty handling and passenger-pleasing ride softness.,Fit-and-finish of plastic parts in center consol near the handbrake lever.  Wish Xenon lights were available on 2.4i. 
4.875,Excellent car,Bing Yu ,10/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,This is the first time I purchased a Volvo. I love its exterior look and interior design. The back seat is pretty roomy.

4.875,Loving It for Now,Dave D. ,09/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have only had it for a couple of weeks so I can not say much about the reliability, but the overall look and feel of the Volvo S40 is everything I was looking for. If you want a smaller refined looking ride that has some speed and handling, look no further. The S40 has a classy but still young and sporty feel to it. For people my age (26) it fits perfectly. The only con is that people looking for a sporty manual transmission the Volvo is not a good pick, but the Five-Speed Geartronic Transmission is very satisfying.","The Five-Speed Geartronic Transmission, the design inside and out, as well as the entire select package.",So far nothing.
