5,Best Car I've Owned in 50 Years,ocita ,07/27/2013,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I special ordered my 2008 Magnum SXT for delivery in the USA while serving in, Afghanistan.It currently has 50K miles on it, most of the miles from long-distance driving.It averages about 27 mpg at 65-70 mph.Out west, at altitudes above 5,000 ft, where the speed limit is 80, the mileage jumps to 33 mpg.Most of the miles on the car have been cross country.I was stopped by a police officer only once.The officer only wanted was to know the name of the color on the car.She loved the color.This is the most comfortable riding and reliable vehicle I have owned n 50 years.The only problem I have had in 5 years was a burned-out license plate light bulb.","The SXT had most of the features I wanted as standard and just added the MyGig sound/GPS system, all-leather interior, 18"" wheels, steel blue paint and some other nice little options.
What I like most about it is its drivability, performance, handling, comfort, quietness and overall quality.
I like being able to load all my favorite music CDs into the hard drive of the MyGig sound system.
The MyGig sound quality is amazing. ",Restart manufacture of the Magnum

It is so reliable and at the time of purchase the car facts rated it at a 93% and I have not been disappointed. Everything about this vehicle, screams reliability, youthfulness and practicality!","The Body itself, it's sleek, sexy, and youthful. The engine is wonderful, the space in it of itself is awesome and the vehicle has been nothing but reliable.","The only improvements, I made where a larger system, and new rims, and tires, exhaust, things that are not factory issued."
3.875,BAD BATCH,PEARL ,07/14/2010,,,5,5,3,1,,3,5,4,5,"I downgraded from a dodge ram hemi to save gas when I bought this 08 magnum that only had 12k on it. Not even a month after I bought the car, it started to shut off in the middle of driving. I took it back to the dealer about 4 times and the computer never recorded anything. They looked at me like a dumb lady and all they did was reflash the computer. The tranny makes loud clunky noises when accelerating and slowing down and it bucks when it shouldn't. Car stations change from FM to AM on it's own. The car shakes sometimes like it has a carburetor, which I know it doesn't have but I do know what it feels like when an old car wants to shut off. Maybe I got a bad car from the batch.",The look of the car is my fave.,I can't suggest anything to be improved cause my whole car needs improvement.

4.875,"Crazy room, head turning, comfortable",bbarber ,05/21/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I'm a big guy, was looking to trade out of an older SUV. I looked at so many makes and models and nothing felt right  Then I test drove a Charger just for the curiosity of having a car again after years of stepping up into an SUV. The Charger was nice. Not enough room!  Dealer suggested a Chrysler 300. After some research, found that the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, and Dodge Magnum were all built at the same assembly plant in Canada. Same frame, same basic interiors.  Saw a Magnum in person. The 2008 is HOT! The look is tough, the interior is comfortable and super spacious.  No compromise for me! Got all the room of my old SUV, all the style of a stacked Magnum. 2.7 V6 ok mileage A+ value!",Exterior is sleek and aggressive. Turns heads. Sport Wagon looks are more sport than wagon.,I added a remote start. Wish all cars came with them installed.  The front bumper has to come off to replace a headlamp. Yikes!?! 
5,Small V-6 has plenty of getup,wagonlover ,05/14/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've only had this car 2 weeks and I am pleased so far. I love the comfort and fit of the interior to my five foot frame. I should have bought one new in '08. I own 3 classic wagons with V- 8s and this six cylinder keeps me happy. The ride is smooth and sporty. The interior space is roomy and comparable with my older wagons, you don't find that much nowadays. This is a true grocery-getter.",Driver's seat and roomy interior. The low profile of the roof.

4.75,Amazing Car says Self-Proclaimed Cynic!,alaskan skies ,04/17/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I purchased my 2008 SXT AWD 3.5L Dodge Magnum around the time Dodge was claiming bankruptcy - at the time I thought I was walking away with a great deal, now that I have had the car for a year I realize that this was probably the best vehicle purchase I have made, or ever will make. This car has it all. It is roomy, yet compact. It is versatile, agile, and swift on its feet. It sports an edgy masculine look as well as a classy interior design. I like its bold look and smooth drive. I purchased the 3.5 L V6 engine and I wouldn't recommend anything less than that. Overall, this is an amazing car and if you find one I'd recommend snapping it up. ",The handling and durability. I go driving in the mountains quite often and this car never complains. It purrs through mountain summits where other cars are slipping into the ditches and sliding into the other lane. ,"The gas mileage on this vehicle is nothing to brag about but considering it is an AWD with a 3.5L V6, I guess it is decent. "
4.625,I love this car!,MBeeson ,03/24/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,4,5,"I've driven this car for about a year now and I am so in love with it. The only con that I've found after all of this time is that the 2.7 liter v6 doesn't have the power that I'm used to. I thought that I would get used to the lack of get up and go, but I never have. That's why I'm considering trading to something different since the larger v6 in the Magnums are hard to find in my area. ","I love the exterior, it has an aggressive look that most cars are lacking, and did we mention the room? It has all the room of a mid size SUV with out an SUV. The interior is nice and comfy even on the base models.","2.7 liter v6 just doesn't have the power for this size car. So if you're buying one and you're used to a larger v6 or a v8 don't go base, get the larger v6 or you'll be wanting to trade up too."
3.375,Seduced by style....,Waggineer ,01/28/2010,,,4,5,2,1,,4,4,3,4,"I purchased an 8 month old Magnum SXT with well less than 10K on the clock.  I fell in love with the looks of the car and the roominess and cargo hauling capability.  The car has a good, solid highway ride and decent handling for a large car.  The downside has been very spotty quality.  Issues have included a new torque converter at 9K, leaky rear diff at 12K, an annoying squeak in the rear of the cabin that the dealer has ""fixed"" 3 times, and a very ""clunky"" 4 speed tranny.   The visibility is really annoying as well.  While I really like the car I'm wondering about the long term reliability given the big ticket warranty repairs I've needed. ","Style, style, style.  This car is a stunner.  The 3.5 liter motor has plenty of kick and returns decent mpg.  It is a rock solid driving experience, very comfortable to drive, has great cargo capacity and a is fine highway cruiser.","Well, it's discontinued so I guess improvments are a moot point."
4.375,Great purchase - would buy another!,NJBloke ,09/29/2009,,,4,5,5,4,,4,5,4,4,"I bought a 2008 certified pre-owned Dodge Magnum SXT (silver/black) three months ago and love it.  I needed space for a part-time business (photography) and did not want an SUV/crossover.  This vehicle drives like a car and has more space and style then any mid-sized SUV on the road. The '08's are relatively rare as they have a redesigned front facia as well as interior (higher-end soft touch plastics, nicer center console, etc.).  If you can find a CPO SXT with low miles for a reasonable price- grab it!  I searched for 3 months and stole mine; it had 16K miles on it and I bought for $12,800.  I plan on keeping this as a second car for years to come.    ","Great passing power from the 3.5 V6 (250hp).  The exterior gorgeous; strong, clean and confident.  The interior is clean with logical placement of controls.  It is very well built.  The back seat has tremendous leg room, and 72 cu ft with rear seats down.  Rear liftgate is an excellent design.","None.  I am 33 years old professional male and love cruising around in my Magnum.  Power, room and handling wrapped up in a tastefully aggressive package.  Great vehicle, I'm happy they are relatively rare too.  Would buy another in a heartbeat. "
5,i love my  magnum,danny lopez ,05/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,i own a dodge magnum  and there's no words to explained the performance and handling on this beast is incredible. One of the best cars dodge ever built.     ,all,NONE IS JUST RIGHT.
4.875,AWD SXT,Gary ,02/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I read every review about the Magnum I could find before buying it as I was concerned about how the AWD would perform and if the 6 cyl was enough power.  I live in NY but found the car in Iowa since they didn't make many '08's trying to find a loaded SXT AWD was difficult.  I am thrilled I bought this car. The AWD works great in the snow and the 3.5 engine moves the car around very well.  I am more pleased with the car and the performance then I expected to be. Right now these cars are a great buy and I highly recommend it. Don't be afraid of going with the 3.5 V6, it handles the weight of the car fine, it does not feel underpowered. Blinds spots are not that bad either.","New styling for '08 with the lower grille, more aggressive hood style.  Mine is loaded so my son loves the rear DVD/TV.  The navigation system is fine, worth the upgrade as it give you more radio options too.","None, discontinued, big mistake."
5,"Roomy, Quiet Oasis in Traffic",Ken ,10/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Being 6'4"" tall, interior room is very important.  I've had the Magnum since February, and at first was worried about the 2.7 L V6, but having driven it to the east coast, over the mountains, was surprised with the power of the car.  Extremely quiet ride, nice stereo system.  Absolutely zero build problems, no mechanical problems with the car at all.  Have to join the chorus that is sorry that they are not building this car any more, really love it.  Traded in a 1995 Dodge Spirit with 120K miles, this car is a whole different ride altogether.  Also considered Cadillac DTS and Buick Lucerne, Magnum has a better quieter ride and is roomier.",Cavernous Interior Room,Bring it back!
4.875,I love it..,Kali ,06/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love my Magnum. I think it is a great bargain and a well thought out design. It even surprises me its an American car. I've had 2 BMW's and this is way better than both of those cars.  I only wish the gas mileage is better.  My AWD gets a little thirsty on fuel but at least I recognize its partially due to my driving style.  The interior and ride are comfortable and natural and I am surprised by how much ""stuff"" I've been able to carry in this vehicle.  Its a shame they stopped making them. Hopefully they'll figure it out and bring it back.","The Driving characteristics of the vehicle as a whole.  Very comfortable and at the same time, feels very safe.",Bring it back to the market is the only improvement they could make at this point.

I started looking at the Magnums, but I did not like the headlights.  I went home and was reading a magazine that the 2008 model will be the last year, but will come with a completely new front end.  The 08 front end looks better than the Charger or the 300.  I ordered one immediately.  This is the coolest looking car I have ever owned.  It is built well, rides great, and performs great!  I usually get a new car every year because I put on about 50k a year, but I think I will keep this one at least 2 years.  This will probably be a classic as only one year for the new design and the last year, with few made!  Absolutely awesome car!",The design!,None.
4.5,Vader's Wagon,Vader's Wagon ,05/15/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"What a tragedy that they are canceling this car. Awesome power and soundtrack from the exhaust. Fantastic ride and classic hot-rod looks. Good but not great fuel economy but it's a big V-8 so one does not buy this car for the mileage. I ride about 30 mi on 95 every day to work and can't keep it under 90! Comfortable and easy to drive fast. Love the MyGig radio even though it is a little confusing to use at times. Parts of the interior are a little cheap but it is a Dodge. Not a fan of the Auto-stick trans, doesn't work great. Otherwise a classic, pick one up before they're all gone!!!! Boo-hiss to Chrysler for dropping the axe on it.",Can you say HEMI? Comfortable interior and ride. Great looks. MyGig radio,"Transmission is horrible at low speeds, vibrates and clunks. Been to dealer twice and they say nothing is wrong. Good thing its got a big warranty!"

I found a rare 29R package with the performance exhaust, seats, wheels, etc. My last two cars were a BMW 5 series and an M3. The Magnum is the best car I have ever owned period! Well controlled ride, quite inside, seats are incredibly comfortable, very powerful and smooth engine and moves the car effortlessly and will do about anything you want, plus in highway driving on my first tank of gas I got 25.6 mi per gallon. Crossovers, the Magnum blows you out of the water. The Magnum does everything better and for less money. What else do you want. I never thought I would own a Dodge WOW!!!","Flexibility, Utility, Smoothness of operation, good gas mileage, very comfortable front bucket seats, MyGig Audio system with 15 GB Hard Drive, MP3 Aux Input Jack, Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC), Cirrus Radio and Stereo System, 20"" Chrome Clad Wheels, and solid/firm suspension.",Don't fire a fantastic car because the people didn't figure out how to package it properly and market it effectively. Keep building great cars like the Dodge Magnum and find people that know how to package and market a great product. Keep the Magnum and put a Cummins Diesel in it.
4.5,Great car,PaulV ,02/09/2008,,,3,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I wanted a sporty, powerful, low CG car, able to pull a small trailer, and haul lots of stuff.  This was the only one under $50K. I recently completed a 4000 mi  roadtrip and it was great.... very comfortable (I'm 6'4""), and it didn't even downshift going up mountain passes. The lifetime powertrain warranty & multidisplacement engine were big pluses. The high intensity headlights are great; turn night into day. I think the interior is ugly; 5 different colors... bad try at a retro look, but I'm getting over it.  The visibility isn't good, and made worse by heavy window tinting. The trailer package didn't come with a hitch or wiring. The my gig system works well; great sound.","Legroom, high intensity headlights, my gig entertainment & nav system, 8cyl/4cyl engine, exterior appearance, power.","Lose the rear window tint, completely redesign the interior or copy the Pacifica.

4.5,Suprised,Pleased ,02/04/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,3,5,4,5,"I thought I would not like the base Magnum SE with the 2.7L engine, I was wrong. The base engine has plenty of power for my needs.  Have you mind, if you're in it for power, then go for the 3.5 or the HEMI. My whole reason for buying is, comfort and gas mileage. I strongly believe that the Magnum SE for me is the best bang for the buck.  It's a lot more comfortable than than the Charger SE. One other thing, it comes with a lifetime powertrain. So what if the motor or trans goes out while you own it, just get it replaced for free.  Go test drive the 2.7L and you'll be surprised.","Interior, very comfortable",Include aluminum wheels instead of steel wheels and hub caps.

Great perfomer, has place for 5 tall people + luggage. Only minus is the fuel economy - in the city. All distances that I drive in a normal day are 3-6 miles with 5-10 traffic lights. Avg: 13 MPG.
