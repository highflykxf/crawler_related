5,Amazing work truck with 4.3,dale ,05/01/2016,,4,5,,,,,5,5,,,"What a kick A## truck!! I used this truck for a whole week straight, major city driving, and merging at least 100 times on the free way.  The truck is a (made in late 07) stripped down model, no ac, no power anything, no cd.  4 Guages on the dash, absolutely basic.  Has the 4.3 Vortec and I am absolutely amazed with the power and handling of this base model!  I mean it really gets out of its way!  Merging and passing is no fuss at all, rarely goes over 3k rpm.  Mileage is at 247k.  Original 4L60E tranny, never rebuilt.  Takes about 5 seconds to go into drive, although no slipping.  Braking power is impressive.  I highly recommend the 4.3.  No fuel management BS no electronic junk, just an old style 4.3 (same hp as my 93 s10 lol).  If your hauling an 8k lb trailer, look other ways.  Towing 4-5k? NO problem!",,
1,AFM Lifter Camshaft Failure at 85K!!,fedcr ,04/18/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,"I've always loved the way that GMC's vehicles look, feel and drive.  We own a 2008 Yukon XL and love it.  This 2008 Sierra Crew Cab SLT 4x4 started consuming 1 quart of oil every 2K miles without any leaks, and then the traction control light, service engine light and many others came on at 84K miles (no warranty).  Took it to the dealer where I bought it, and the dealer said it is cylinder 5, camshaft and lifters need to be replaced, and it would be better for me to spend $7500 on a new engine.  I skipped the dealer and called GM who agreed to cover everything above $3500.  I asked the dealer if the problem with the AFM has been fixed and the dealer said they are not aware of a problem.   Ridiculous.  So I have a brand new engine but have no confidence in how long it will last.  I'm hoping to get rid of this and buy anything other than a GM product.",,

Did I mention, I LOVE my Envoy? Love everything about it, except for the LIFTERS!!!! Every year we have a few replaced. Tisk, Tisk on you GM, you need to figure this problem out. It is too expensive to ignore. WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER GMC, BUICK, CADILLAC, or CHEVY, until GM comes clean. GM knows that this problem exists and yet cannot seem to fix it, or admit they know something is wrong with their fuel management system.  Thanks for an undependable SUV that breaks down every year because GM's fuel management system is faulty, shoody, and SUPER EXPENSIVE to repair! No, never again GMC. Love my ENVOY, so mad because Yukon has been my dream truck since I was a teenager. You can keep your ""fancy"" looking vehicles and your literally EXPLOSIVE Hcell cars, your defective gas tanks that kill people, I do not trust you GM. I am breaking up with you, and I never want you back. You are nothing but a disappointment, a mirage of what seems to be like the perfect vehicle until you realize you were just dreaming and this mirage you bought into will cost your family two to four thousand dollars once or twice each year.

The truck looks good other than it now needs major engine repair.  Full synthetic oil changes every 3000-4000 miles, light hauling never beyond capacity, all maintenance kept up and serviced regularly never raced or beat on and I am the original owner.  I am very disappointed in this vehicle and will never purchase another GM product again.  I should not have issues like this until 200,000 miles or more are showing on that odometer with correct maintenance.

3.25,Check carefully before you buy,txcwby ,12/27/2013,,,5,5,1,1,,5,5,1,3,"Overall, i would not buy this truck again due to repair costs. At 104,000 miles (notice it's just outside the warranty) engine heads both cracked - with the mileage and the reported issues about oil usage and AFM related issue, it makes more sense to replace with a GM crate engine than to solve part of the problem. Mileage on E85 is 14mpg in 2wd if you are an extremely light footed driver. With 87 octane, the average mpg (light foot) is 18mpg-19mpg in hilly terrain. As a cowboy and rancher, my vehicle is my lifeblood and cost of ownership and reliability is key.This truck just hasn't met the minimum expectations. Cost for new engine at GM dealer - $7,898.77 ","Interior is well done, instrument cluster is extremely clear, and buttons are all sized for when you have gloves on. ","Turning radius is ridiclously large. 

Body roll/sway when making a sharp turn at >45mph can easily feel like losing control due to length of vehicle and stiffness of frame. 

Oil level gauge needs to be installed - this truck will go from 'ok' to stop engine - low oi pressure without any warning - such as oil pressure PSI gauge showing reduced oil.
That's great for the pump working effectively, but it's nice to know when you're getting low - and based on forum feedback, the AFM engine in this truck can burn 1 quart of oil every 3,000 miles and be considered normal by GM. "

There are a few nitpicking things though, I hate the hesitation when you give it gas suddenly.  I am told this is due to GM using ""torque management"" in their PCM tune. Ford and Dodge do not this. This is probably the only real disappointment.  The others are small things like when you hit the recirculation button on the AC, then turn the AC on, it defaults back to outside air, you have to hit the recirculation button again. Drives me nuts. The mileage is about what you would expect from a truck this size and engine size. Overall, I love the truck..the quality is very good.","Styling, interior, and comfort.  Has an excellent ride.  When towing, the truck drives very straight and controlled (stabilitrack)","Remove torque management from PCM tune.

Heated seats, great sound system, upgraded leather seats overall nicer inside. Like the return of drum brakes in the back and nice wheels.  EZ lift tailgate is a godsend.  Can be open/closed with one hand.  Better heater then the 04 but still slow to warm in stop/go traffic on cold mornings below 20 degrees.

On top of the alarms that the dealer cannot fix I have had two interior fans replaced and they are rattling again. The motor is tapping even though I do the recommended everything.

I have always loved GMC'S so I love this one too, it looks great and other than the squeak has been great. There is a lot of air noise from the doors that is annoying with the radio off.

Mine is a 4x2 because I am always on asphalt and it rarely snows in SE Virginia. One tip: Stabilitrak comes with traction control. So consider this option with a 2WD if you want a lower sticker and really don't want/need the extra maintenance and fuel comsumption of a 4WD. This vehicle handles well and is smooth and quiet.

I suspect that will go up as the motor breaks in, but hey if you're looking for fuel economy buy a prius and just hope that someone in a 1500 doesn't hit you.

I live in Iceland and there is no map for my country for the NAV system. Something I knew but never the less, miss... Other than that, well my car is slightly indifferent about saving fuel..."
5,Great truck,robert trapp ,02/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Have driven GMC trucks for several decades, this is quite possibly the best I have ever owned. Quiet ride, strong frame, good power and torque, no cheap interior like Toyota. Best looking truck on the market. I drive over railroad tracks every day, completely unnoticeable in this truck. Love the OnStar and XM radio features. Lots of interior room as I am a large person, yet fit comfortably inside","XM radio, strong powertrain, proven reliability",
5,Almost Perfect!,Sheepless ,02/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Before purchasing this vehicle I researched everything about it to the inth degree. I ended up trying to decide b/t the 08 Tundra and the 08 Sierra. I test drove the Tundra and liked it, immediatly following I went and test drove the Sierra and fell in love. MPG is as advertised. I can feel the v8 switch to 4cyl but no one else in the veh can, not a bid geal. My 2 dislikes: the brakes and transmission. Simply put, replace the rear drums with the Tundra's disc brakes and replace the 4 speed tranny with a 5 or 6 speed and you have the perfect truck! The 5.3 (w the 4 speed) feels less beefy than you would expect. All in all, I am extremely pleased. I am now a GM man for life.","The comfortable ride is #1. Remote start, solid quiet ride, MPG (Active Fuel Mgt), auto lights, stereo controls, wide stance, roomy comfortable interior. Of course the exterior. I could go on...","Disc brakes on rear wheels. Get rid of the 4 speed transmission. The EZ lift is not so ez. Some small picky things: better OEM tires, little longer bed."
5,Best Truck for the Money,Matt ,01/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have been looking at buying a new truck for a while and the Sierra Denali is by far the best bang for the buck, that is if you can afford it.  The truck has the best ride and handling of any truck I have ever driven. Gas mileage is not to great, so far I have average 15 mpg in the city and I got up to 22 mpg on the highway, but that is not to bad considering you have 403 HP on tap. The truck has excellent fit and finish and the exhaust note is very nice. If you pay sticker for this truck you will be paying way too much, I managed the get the 2WD model with the upgraded 20"" chrome wheels for $35,900 (retailed for a little over 42).  Bottom line, a great truck for the money.","Remote start, bose sound system, 403 HP, power folding mirrors with tilt- down, the leather seats are very comfortable, the overall appearance of the truck (hands down the best looking factory truck, turns a lot of heads), heated windshield washer fluid when ice covers your winshield, smooth ride.","Standard spray in bed liner and side steps. Also, based on the retail price a sunroof should be standard. I don't have many complaints about this truck, it is an all around great truck."
4.875,Best truck I've ever owned,Ralph Vandenberg ,01/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've been driving my Denali for about 3000 miles so far. It's an allover amazing vehicle. I haven't been able to find any faults whatsoever with the exception of the power being too tempting.... I'm going through the gas a bit faster than I'd like because it's too easy to hit the pedal. I give GMC full marks on this truck, it's got to be the best truck on the market right now.","The ride, power and comfort all combine for a great ride",None
5,Excellent Truck,Bryan2008 ,01/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,GMC really did a great job with this truck.  I really love the power of the engine and the comfort.  I do not drive it much trying to keep those miles off of it.  But when I do it is a treat and makes me appreciate life more.  It definitely is deserving of much kudos. Thanks again GMC for a really great vehicle.,"Acceleration, OnStar, cell phone, and navigation.  Also gas mileage and technology in this truck compared to the new Tundra. ",None
2.625,Not a Happy Owner,Luke ,01/12/2008,,,4,4,1,2,,2,4,1,3,"I have always been a Chevy man, really needed a new pickup so I went with the GMC. I wanted the 5.3l because it does great in my 01 Suburban. My New 5.3, which has fuel management gets much worse mileage. I get 13.5 MPG at any speed or condition driving, even downhill. Also the 4 sp transmission is clunky, brakes are sticky, interior clothe is Horrible, interior plastic comes apart, body has many mud pockets which will rot the metal and the front tire sprays road wash Into the frame by the front door. I am NOT happy with this truck which now has 3500 miles on it.",New dash,"Body, engine, interior, transmission, brakes ALL need Improvement"
4.875,So Far So Good,kitch ,01/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Just over 1 week of ownership and I can say I am very pleased with the vehicle. Traded in my Titan LE for this. Interior fit, finish and textures is by far the best I've seen on any truck. Flip up seats in the rear are nice and a necessity (Tundra I test drove didn't have that). Bose stereo is good and Nav seems easy to operate. Not quite as fun to drive as my Titan was, but still decent. Nice rumble from the stock exhaust. 6 speed tranny is smoooooth. Nice and quiet at 60mph. The AWD is a nice feature to have.","6.2L engine, AWD, 20"" wheels, autostart is awesome, heated steering wheel and 6spd transmission","More interior storage (there isn't even a compartment overhead for sunglasses), Bluetooth, Console shifter instead of boring column shifter, factory spray-in bedliner and running boards should be standard equipment, higher end stereo system and chrome exhaust tip would be nice"
5,Near Perfect,OD ,01/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The absolute best truck on the market! Had my Sierra w/ All Terrain package for three weeks and at just under 3k miles, I couldn't be happier.  Rides like a luxury car on the highway and an off-roader when needed. All Terrain package runs just under Denali as far as price but maintains more of the off- roader feel.  Z71 package w/ 20"" chrome wheels, 5.3 liter V8, 2-tone leather seating, & much more. I am getting 20 to 21 mpg on hwy & 17 city! Not bad for a larger V8 that really isn't meant for fuel effiency. Overall, best truck on the market after extensive checking and I couldn't be happier. If you are looking for a real deal with a great feel do not stop short of at least drinving one!","Remote start, rear parking assist, heated seats w/ memory, rain sensitive wipers, on board computer interface, remote folding mirrors, Z71 package. Smooth, solid handling in all driving situations, folding rear seating w/ high quality leather amenities, 8 cup holders, 4 power outlets, & so much more!","Updating the transmission to a six speed would be nice & maybe another inch or two ground clearance for Z71 4X4.

4.75,King of Trucks,DACO7916 ,01/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"To me this is the best full size pick up there is on the market. It is the perfect combination of power, comfort, elegance, sportiness, not too over the top styling.",Really like the OnStar feature (already used it once). The navigation system is really good too. Bose sound system very good for a truck.,The main thing would be a little better gas mileage and also a little bit better fit and finish.
5,Best of the Breed,sknabt ,01/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I decided to replace my SUV with a full-size truck. Choice came down to an '08 Sierra SLT vs. an '07 Tundra Limited ('08 Tundra priced way out of my budget) because I've always bought Japanese. Tundra has nice powertrain but falls short in every other category, especially it's bloated price. GMC SLT's greatest selling point is its luxury grade interior. Tundra is very weak here. GMC's shift at any speed automatic 4x4 is far better than Tundra's crude hi/lo 4x4. GMC has better crash test scores than the Tundra. This is the 1st full-size truck I've ever owned but driving it is actually a joy. Parking is a learning experience but the parking assist makes it doable even for a newbie like myself.","10-way heated leather driver/passenger seats, rear parking assist, OnStar, automatic 4x4 mode, command center, MP3 input, rear doors open 170 degrees, adjustable gas pedal, automatic lights, remote start (heats seats), heated washer fluid, smooth ride/powertrain, EZ-lift tailgate, classic good looks","MPG a bit weak even for a truck (getting 16-17 mpg with 60+% highway driving), Bose stereo (flat mid-range and treble, decent base), high square hood hard to see over, tinted windows restrict night visibility, average Consumer Reports reliablity rating, make stability control standard, turn radius"
4.25,Capable and solid,LYNDONGOLDEN ,01/05/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,3,3,"I wanted a stylish ""basic"" regular cab truck.  I looked for a comparably equipped Tundra but there were few choices out there...with only leftover '07 models, almost all of them long-bed and white! And none of the base model Toyotas had factory XM radio. So I purchased the Work Truck package Sierra... and I'm very pleased. The dash design, controls, seats, driving position, and interior storage all work very well for my tastes. The cargo management system is very usefeul as well.  And the 4.8 V8  has a satisfying exhaust rumble.  I drive alot in the bumpy inner-city Houston streets, and this truck hamdles it well.  This was a good choice, and I beleive it will serve me well.",,
5,Glad to be Back,Mike ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I traded in my 02 Dodge about 1500 miles ago and I could not be happier. The truck performs great and will haul the snowmobile trailer much better than the Ram did. I am averaging roughly 15mpg which is 3mpg better than the Dodge.,"The quality of ride is great. The truck rides and accelerates smoothly, quietly.",I have two complaints for the truck. A notification for being in 4wd should be put in the gauge package; in NY this time of year we use the 4wd a lot and sometimes you forget that it is engaged. The back up sensors get covered with snow/ice and quit working. Nothing GM can do about the weather thoug
5,Best One Yet,Best One Yet ,01/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,After driving GMC trucks since 1974 this new 2008 Sierra is the best one yet. The interior is outstanding with great back support in the bucket seats; easy accesss to everything on the dash; to great controls on the steering whell. This is the first time for GMC to have cruise control on the steering wheel and it is much easier to operate.  Performance is outstanding with the 5.3 engine and my gas mileage is good as well. With the 4-6-8 engine I get 24 to 25 mile to the gallon at 55 mph. Amazing!  My friends drive Fords and Dodges and their milage is so bad 10-12 mile per gallon. Too bad they didn't buy a GMC. My company truck is a Ford 4x4 and on a good day it gets 12-13. Really sad. ,Comfort/ ride and low road noise,Chrome grille.
5,Best Truck Ever,jcn7vc ,12/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have only driven this truck for a week now, but I love it more than any other car I have every touched.  The gas mileage is better than advertised, it does very well in the snow and on icy roads.  It looks better than the pictures.  It handles like a car on the road and a truck off the road.  Perfect for any situation.  Lots of room in the crew cab, and the bed, although short, is still long enough for most items.  I really love this truck!","Gets over 20 mpg on highway with cruise control. Active fuel management, reverse assist, steering wheel mounted controls, heated seat (heat up in about 1 min), remote start",A little bit taller windsheild. Definitely need side steps with the Z- 71 package. Torque converter restricts acceleration. A little bit longer bed with a shorter hood and front end.
4.875,Compare Denali to any other 1/2 ton.,bob ,12/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I went into the truck market expecting to buy a Tundra because I have had such good luck with Toyotas.To say that I was pleasantly surprised with the Sierra is an understatement. I priced a loaded SLT with the 6 liter engine and the Denali was about the same price. It was an easy decision to buy the Denali because of the extas like the 6.2 liter motor and six speed tranny to mention a few. This truck will run with the Tundra, rides better, handles better and has a more refined interior. My wife prefers the Denali over her Acura RL, which she loves. My freinds can not believe the power with the engine and tranny combination. Do yourself a favor and test drive a Denali when looking for a new truck!","Drivetrain, Autostart, the ride and handling, luxurious interior, build quality, fold up rear seat, remote folding mirrors. This truck comes with so many standard features and safety features.  ",Better MPG ( I'm getting 15 MPG ). Needs telescoping wheel. Sirius radio would be nice instead of XM.

4.875,News of GM's dimise greatly exhaggerated,The Needle ,12/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"A family member bought the Tundra in Oct.'07-Toyota is making a big deal out of their 5.7L engine etc...the Tundra is a nice truck--but I decided to go with the Sierra for several reasons: Better road manners--especially on the freeway--very tight steering. Much more luxurious, refined and thought-ought interior.  Everything inside is beautiful and solid--not an easy feat to accomplish. Classic looks--yet modern.  GM really hit a home run with this design.  I get more looks and questions than when I had a Porche. Perfect size Crew-cab.  This is the biggest downer with Tundra--you either get the smaller ex-cab or the huge double--bigger than Dodge's.  Bad combo. GM hands down!","The stereo is very nice, Remote start is a most if you park your truck outdoors as I do.  Stereo controls on steering wheel.  Supple leather seats. Perfect height and great visibility from and to all angles.  The ride is smooth, yet it never stops being a truck.  Denali grille option. Individual air","Standard side curtain air bags--it's a shame GM fell short on this.  Standard back-up sensors would be nice.  The biggest fault, if there is one, is the outdated but reliable transmission.  Toyota has a leg up with a 6-speed to GM's 4 speed--unless you upgrade to Denali.  Hybrid version?"
4.875,This is one amazing truck!,Denjhe ,11/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I have had my Black/black 08 Sierra Denali for about 2 months now. Amazing power. Amazing comfort.. Amazing headturner.

It gets decent mileage for its powerhouse 403hp 6.2 liter engine. Best stock V8 horsepower of any brand and you still can chip it to 500hp +. The interior is refined and classy. It looks like my BMW 5 series inside. You can buy a regular fully loaded 4X4 crew and pay the same price. I feel this is the best deal in luxury trucks.approx. 40-45k depending on options. The cadillac escalade has become synonomous with bling bling and hip hop.- it is a little to showy for me. This Denali is not so showy and has a beautiful interior.

4.625,Very Nice Truck,Pittsburgh-Mike ,11/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"Very nice truck, great build quality.  Unlike an ealier review that states the stereo is great, in my opinion the Bose system is a huge disapointment.  The Factoy Nav system is great, but the speakers and center dash speaker is terrible.  Why GM would even waist the money advertising it is a Bose system is beyond me.  For a $45K truck, I would expect a better sounding stereo system.  Gas milage is adverage, but you dont buy this truck for fuel milage.  Ineterior quality is very nice.  Wish GN had a 6' bed option with this truck, 5'8"" bed is a lottle small.
