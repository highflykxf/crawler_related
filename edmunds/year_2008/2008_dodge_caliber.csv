5,Great little car,Steve J ,07/09/2016,4,3,3,,,5,3,4,3,,,"Nothing fancy, but great functionality.  Reliable.  Good acceleration (2.0).  Loves to drive/ride at 75mph on highway -- it glides n sails.  Has 93k miles on it.  Bought it for $10.5k in December of 2009.  Paid for -- resale value $5000 cash (dang good after 7years!).  I changed the alternator ($1000- but that was probably because I drove it in salt-water puddles on the beach in Florida) 3 years ago.  New tires ($450).  Two batteries ($200).  Windshield wipers ($25).  That's it.  Runs like a charm.  I'm looking around for a new car, but no rush.  Lucky me.  Hope I didn't jinx myself.",,
1,Most Ridiculous Car Ever Made,Neal Buck ,08/04/2015,2,3,3,,,4,3,1,2,,,"I can't believe this car was ever made. It's utterly ridiculous. First and foremost, the acceleration is practically non existent. The harder you push down the acceleration pedal, the slower the car accelerates. I think the issue is more with the automatic transmission than the actual torque, though, because it often feels like the car is starting from second gear and then realizes it's not supposed to do that and jerkily downshifts to first. The suspension is a sort of princess and the pea situation with every little bump in the road translating into a spleen-rattling affair.  From the outside, the Caliber looks like a spacious family car, but the inside is fully taken up with the dashboard, which is roughly the size of an eight-seat dining room table. The front seats have a fair amount of leg room underneath the dashboard, but any backseat passengers don't fare as well. And good luck fitting more than one kid's car seat back there. You would think they could have taken a couple of feet out of the dash to provide more room for the back seats. I can only assume the engineer responsible for the Caliber's design envisioned serving a large meal on the dashboard. There can be no other reason for that design. I have only two good things to say about this car. First, we have had to do no major repairs on it since we got it. But I think that's about to change. I believe the suspension and transmission will be requiring repairs before long. Second, the storage space is pretty decent, especially when you lay down the back seats. Overall, I wouldn't wish this car on anyone. Its two small perks do not compensate for a host of design failures and automotive mishaps. This car is actually really funny when you give it much thought. It's like the engineers planned it as a practical joke.",,
4,Had me hooked at first drive!,Rebecca ,07/21/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,4,4,,,"Yes, it has lackluster acceleration, but overall, I LOVE my car!! Perfect size for driving daily to and from work alone, but also, easily fits 4-5 people without too much complaint. Great hauling capability with the fold down seats (although the angle of the back hatch has gotten in my way a time or two). Gas mileage is spectacular, even as it gets older, still holds well! Have had minimal maintenance (other than normal oil changes, new tires, etc.), two months ago was the first time I had to have something fixed, power steering pump lines had a hole and entire pump wasn't working correctly, but $400 later (the most I have spent on any repair or maintenance), brand new pump, and it is driving as good as new!!Acceleration could be better, and it is not a fan of going up in to the Rockies here in Colorado, but overall, I would say this is a great car, has been great for me, and I love it!!",,
4,Love my car!,Nicole ,07/09/2015,5,4,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,"This car was definitely not my first choice, but at the time I was still in college and dad pretty much decided for me. But I'm so glad we went with the Caliber! Yes, it lacks many of the bells and whistles of a more expensive car/brand. It doesn't have heated seats, or a fancy interior. But my major repairs have been few and far between (and by major i mean nothing totalling over $300). This car is 7 years old and is still going like a champ! It's been so good to me and in turn i've been good to it. I'm constantly surprised by how well it's held up over all this time considering it doesn't have the best reputation. The Pros, in my opinion: Cruise control is an awesome plus. It also hasn't required many major repairs. I don't consider it a very noisy car, and the sound system is pretty good too. My favorite thing about this car is the storage. All the back seats fold forward and i've been amazed at what i've been able to fit in this car! It's only proven to me that I want to continue buying hatchbacks if i can. The couple ""complaints"" i have are: Lackluster acceleration, feels light enough to fly off the road if i'm going too fast (road holding?), doesn't do all that well in snow (totally fine in rain, though) and like i said, no bells and whistles. The one major repair I had other than the breaks is that the cord(?) connecting my shifter to the transmission broke, so my car wouldn't recognize what gear i was in. That was a $300 repair, and that was this year (so after 7 years). Overall I'm extremely happy with this purchase, especially for the money we paid. I might sell it this year but that's only because i'd like to get at least a little money for it! But if money weren't an issue, i'd continue to drive it until it died.",,

4,Hidden Gem,blackwell2012 ,02/29/2012,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I bought my Cali SXT with a 2.0 liter engine new in 2008. I read about pepole dogging the model, but let me tell you it handles great. I'm a professional driver, and can attest to the cars nimble performance characteristics. I can routinely weave through 70 or 80 cars on a 23 mile early morning busy traffic run. The car is good off the line and mantains manuverability and tractionality at the 70 to 72 mile an hour range. That's about as fast as anyone goes in traffic or highway crusing anyhow. The cabin is comfortable, the Sirius satellite radio sounds nice on the speakers, and you always feel in command.The doors make a nice thump sound when you close them. Well made for the money paid.","You have to get the extended max warranty. I did and never regreted the $1800 cost paid @ $125 a month. I had my first tune up, brakes and rotors resurfaced at 52,000 miles last week. The car was also making creeking sounds at 5mph and 100 rpms. I paid a $100 deductable and Baker Dodge of Princeton ended up installing a brand new transmission. They also replaced the two front struts, left control arm, left bearing and hub, and both back shocks. The warranty saved me over $8,000 in repairs. Dodge's customer service at the dealership and with my corporate case manager was superb. The dealership also paid for my rental car for several days, as they took the time to get the car in tip top shape.","The Caliber has a sun roof and it has leaked when it rains hard. Quality of workmanship, and Made In America Pride, should be a key aspect of every stage of the auto manufacturing process. Dodge corporate HQ, now that they are partnered with Fiat, would be well served to use great service departments like Baker Dodge as examples for other franchises to follow. Corporate could brand market loyalty by making extended warranties available for anyone who owns a Dodge. With the cost of automotive reapirs nearly cost prohibitive for many American families, Dodge should lead the way, and offer monthly payments on large repair bills."

The A/C broke, transmission had problems, it had so many problems that I cannot remember them all! The biggest issue that I had with it was the water leak! It took the dealership one year and 6 different times to figure out what was wrong with it! If i had not called head office, and they sent a specialist to look at it they would have never figured out what was wrong with it! Thank god it was under warrenty when I first went it, and when the problem continued they paid for it, because they knew they sold me a faulty car.

Once 40,000 miles hit, the problems began. Started hearing loud clanking noise when driving on highway. I read numerous complaints about the Caliber having suspension problems. I panicked & took it right in. I didn't want to worry about my child riding in this car. Today they tell me they cannot find what is causing it... said the suspension is tight BUT suspect it is the bushings. They didn't want to take a part yet so has to get worse. AND my oxygen sensor quit so paid to get that fixed. I was not expecting all this so soon. Now I will continue to worry.","Inside is so comfortable. Works great for getting child in and out of back. Sometimes when the front passenger seat is pushed all the way back, it hampers the person trying to sit in the back seat. Just takes getting used to. Gas mileage is awesome. Torque is terrible and pulling out into interstate traffic is a bit dangerous... no get up and go to this car. ","Dodge needs to work on suspension to this car.. make it stronger.

I have the 2.0L CVT, and I am very pleased with the gas mileage and performance so far.  I did not buy this car expecting great amounts of power - I bought it for the fuel efficiency, space, value for money, and looks (in that order).  I drove the Mazda 3, Chevy HHR, Chrysler PT Cruiser (which I have owned before) and the Toyota Matrix when comparing.  Although I had it narrowed down to the Caliber and the HHR (based on the issues listed above), I chose the Caliber over the HHR because of the final variable of value for money - the Caliber was 2K cheaper, and offered most of the same features as the HHR.","Roomy interior, fuel efficiency, sporty looks","As with others, wouldn't mind a little more oomph.

Outside of routine maintenance I've not had to do a thing to the car.  The car rides comfortably, handles great, and with decent tires it performs well in inclement weather.

The car handles well in the snow, minus the all- wheel or 4 wheel option, due to the 17"" tires and wide wheel base.

They had to replace both front struts, lower left control arm, the multifunction switch, airbag clock sensor.

I know that I gave up some mileage, but it has good power and the AWD will be for the winter weather here in Missouri. The transmission takes a little getting used to. It has a slight delay in pickup speed when you floor it, but it has a very smooth transfer up to speed. The cab forward is a little hard to get used to. Also, the way the front end slopes down makes is a little tough project where the front corners are until you driven it a while.  Mostly made in USA. Foreign cars in this price range feel cheap. This car has a big car feel. ",I really like the way it handles. It gives you the small car handling with a mid-size car ride. I also am amazed at the power. I got it for highway driving and it has performed very well in passing. The seating is also more comfortable then I thought it would be. They are heated (5 star safety),"Not much I can think of.

5,All's good that ends good,The Dodge ,03/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I test drove a number of vehicles. For the money, gas, and all around quality of a vehicle Dodge was hands down the best. The Caliber was the only one that my wife really responded to as far as the looks and design. While she test drove this one and many other calibers she could find no complaints. I have no idea what the future brings for this car but Dodge obviously does because they have a lifetime powertrain warranty. These reviews are very helpful, but please just try one for yourself. Not only fuel efficient but all around affordable. Thank you.",Car design and room inside the car.,Maybe they should all have chrome wheels instead of hubcaps.
4.75,Sweet Ride,DROSE27 ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I purchased my 08 Caliber in Feb. loving it so far! It's so much fun to drive, and people are constantly taking second looks. I don't see that many on the road. It fits our family of three perfectly. I wish that the cruise control was lighted when the lights come on. ","MPG, lighted cup holders, style",Have a button for the hatchback in the car and on the keyless entry. A little too plasticky which makes it a little harder to keep clean.
4.75,Good in crash,Jessi ,02/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"This car was great to drive, comfortable and affordable. No one wanted to test the crash test rating, but we did. We were rear-ended on the freeway going very fast. I think the car did a great job absorbing the impact and the fact that my husband, my dog and myself are still around is the testimony.",Lighted cup holders,
5,Great car!,Peter ,02/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased a Caliber RT AWD 5 months ago and I really enjoy this mid car. It rides great, AWD and ESP are awesome, it's perfect for Quebec winter conditions. The Caliber is fun to drive, specially in snow.","AWD, ESP (Electronic Stability Program) Classy leather seats, roomy, stereo.",None.
4.625,Replaced Jeep GC 4x4,Ray ,02/01/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,4,5,"Not sure why so many national reviewers are giving this vehicle so much grief. I have the RT with the 2.4L 5spd Manual. Coming from a V6 SUV, I think this car has a lot of pep.  Love the color options, my model is Black ext with black and red accents interior.  Very roomy in the front. Although, I wish they narrowed steering column. Having short legs I have to be a little closer to the steering wheel. My legs scrape getting in and out. ",2 tone interior. Black interior with the red accented seats and console. Beverage cooler and lighted cup holders,"Narrower steering column. My legs scrape getting in and out. Even with the seat as low as possible. I have a Sirius account all ready with a portable radio, unless you purchase the radio with the Navigation, you can't get Song/Artists display. I miss that."
4.625,Jody's review,Jody68 ,01/31/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,5,5,Just purchased it and I absolutely love it.  I love the chilled compartment for your drinks and the gas mileage is great.  I got the burnt orange color and I love it.  Great car,,Would like to have a 6 cylinder
5,I love my Caliber,Raider ,01/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've only had my black metallic 1.8L SXT for a month, but it's been extraordinary even compared to all my other vehicles, and my last vehicle was a Cadillac. It's utilitarian and tough, solid, quiet, comfortable, and I'm having no problem getting around in the Wyoming winter at 7,000 feet. Great ground clearance. The pedals and stick are right where I need them (I ordered the manual). I get 31 mpg on the highway and around 26 in town, and it has no problem starting when it's 20 below zero. I hoped for a lot out of this vehicle, and it's surpassed everything I expected, especially for the price. Kicks the Matrix, Mazda 3 and Vibe to the curb on value and style, and performs equally well.","Folding front passenger seat, hatch and rolling tonneau, stain-resistant fabric seats, removable cargo mat, surprising get-up-and-go for a four cylinder, and this is a pretty heavy car. I think that only helps on icy roads and drifted snow. The front wheel drive is working as well as my 4x4 Dodge.","Not a lot of visibility for riders in the backseat, but I rarely have passengers, and I wouldn't sacrifice the feisty styling for anything."
4.5,Nice Improvement from 2007,Bill ,01/19/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"I bought my '08 Caliber after totaling my '07 Caliber in a deer collision. the deer actually got hit into me from a vehicle going the other way and it caused quite a bit of damage (airbags and all), nobody was hurt though. I liked my '07 so I went to the dealer and bought an '08 for about 500 dollars more. I couldn't be happier. What I lost in gas mileage (approx 5mph) I gained in comfort and ride. The 08's come with dark grey interiors which are much easier to keep clean. The 6 speed auto transmission is alot quieter. The whole car seems smoother and stabler on the road. It cruises smoothly and quiet. It handles the snow with no problems. Gas mileage was 27mph on my last tank. Great car!",Interior and style. Safety- 5 star rated (I know),Maybe gear it a little higher to make up for the gas mileage lost with the new transmission.
3.875,Not too shabby,wparkki ,12/30/2007,,,5,3,3,5,,3,5,4,3,It's a great little family car and is astounding in the snow. I owned a Ford Escape 4x4 before this car and it can't even begin to compare to this cars ability to manuver and maintain traction,I really like my heated seats and the 9 speaker stereo with built in sub,The back window is very small and you can't use it to back up with you have to trust your miriors
4.75,"SRT-4, Amazing Car for the price",SRT-4 Owner ,12/14/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I recently perchased a Caliber SRT-4 and after the 1st 300 milies I am still amazed that Dodge is selling this car so cheap.  Engine/trans are as good or beter than drive systems in $40K+ cars.  Inside there is a bit too much plastic.  Some kind of wood dash kit would fix this, even if it was after market. The ride is firm and confident but not not to harsh at highway crusing speed.  The steering wheel mounted radio controls are nice, (standard) the speedomiter takes getting used to, as it is somewhat small.  Bottom line: $35K+ car perfomance engine/ drive train/suspention, $15K car interior for just over $20k.  A best buy for some who wants a Zcar/M3 range track times for under 25K","285hp engine, Great 6 spd trans, nice looking exterior, firm handling ride, seats and seating possision.  Steering wheel radio controls, and price","Interior matterials (dash, door pannels, console) Offering a wood dash, 2 tone plasic, etc. would work. "
5,Buy One Youl love it,steve ,12/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This mid sized car is awsome to drive. Looks great and rides great. The R/T awd is the way to go when you're going somewhere. Had many,many compliments on the color, factory ad ons, great car",AWD better than limited slip. When roads are a little icy slush covered kicks right in and goes," None, love just the way it is"
5,Love driving this car,JerryK ,12/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My first new car since my 98 Grand Caravan. This car impressed me right from the test drive. The reviews mention a slow response of the CVT.  Hogwash,the 2.0L w/CVT moves like a jack rabbit. My previous Mopars had lousy headlights, backup lights, and brakes. All are improved on this car. I can finally see the road on a rainy night. The SXT model is nicely equipped. Great car to take back and forth to work everyday. Very comfortable.","Hatchback, fold down front/rear seats good for hauling. Like a micro SUV. Oil filter easy to get to. Fog lamps are nice.",Trip odometer reset in a bad spot. Rear headrests block view.
5,Very nice and priced great,Dave ,11/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We just got this car last weekend.  We looked at a bunch of different cars.  It impressed us with the room and comfort it offered.  Plenty of power and rides great.  Fuel mileage is very impressive.,"Gas mileage, room and style.",Nothing up to this point
4.75,"Great price, quality ratio",Tom ,10/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,5,5,"Traded a V8 Jeep Grand Cherokee. My wife and I could not be happier at this point. The car has a lot to offer for the price. It handles well and gets 25 to 26 honest mpg. at 78 to 80 mph (checked 3 times). At 70 it gets 30 plus mpg. Around town it gets 25 mpg. It needs more pick up from 0 to 40 but it can cruise along at 90. I suggest a 2.4 that gets 185 horses - but still gets good milleage. This is the first 4 cylinder I have ever had. I'm impressed. Sunroof and other options are really enjoyable. Inside is ""plasticy,"" but the price is right.  It handles better in high winds and over rail road tracks at higher speeds than my friends 4cyl camry.",Stereo although it drives well!,185 horses!
