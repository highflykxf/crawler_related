No snow traction what so ever I got stuck three times, thank God I was not in a rush to get anywhere. I also had to recently replace the coil pack because of a misfire and it happened all of a sudden as I was driving and it was super scary.

2.75,Pedal positioning is painful,rojo8 ,12/21/2014,,,2,4,4,4,,3,1,3,1,"The gas and brake pedals are far apart and both are high off the floor, so it's impossible to pivot your foot comfortably on the heel. I have to completely let my foot off the gas pedal in order to hit the brake. No big deal obviously on high speed drives with minimal braking, but in-town driving is painful. Because it's so uncomfortable, it's also very unsafe. I'd find myself resisting moving back and forth between braking and accelerating, which obviously is not a safe driving practice. 
If you're small-feeted like me (size 8-9; not terribly small in fact) but you're used to stomping on your pedals, then no big deal. Pivoting is safer because it's more comfortable. What an idiotic design.",Reliability,"It's a discounted make, but to what seems to be the majority of car makers today: Do away with the misguided ""safe"" positioning of the pedals, supposedly there to minimize unintended acceleration. Making them more easily differentiable, also makes them totally uncomfortable for people, at least women, with small-average feet and thus unsafe. As simple is that. 
I've not been able to drive this car for the year and a half that we've owned it. Luckily I don't work, and my husband has big feet (sz 13) so he has no trouble with the pedals. "

I had them look at the car. (keeping it over night) They informed me that the wave plate was the issue and my car was undrivable.So my Fiance go a hold of GM and let them know the issue. They got back to us saying its a known issue that they fixed with the 2009 version but basically since we were past five years even though we are under the 100k for the warranty we are out of luck.So by admitting fault but are leaving us stuck with a 4k bill. ,I love this car.

Lots of space, plenty of power for a luxury sedan which surprised me, and just the defined look of the Aura catches you off guard.My Aura has 106,000km on her now and the only thing replaced so far was the driver side strut which was a quick fix. Very reliable car and is high enough off the ground to go on gravel roads into the woods without sacrificing any comfort at all ! Handles turns, and bumps beautifully. Also if your worried about a V6 eating gas... Don't be worried. I get at least 500-550km in the city with full tank and over 700km on highway but that's going around 120+km/hr.. ","Engine is great but kicks out abit more power if you get a better air intake for it. Smooth ride with a sense of luxury. Great features on the dash like temperature, oil life, individual TPMS, and Electronic Stability Control once your traction control kicks in. Theirs some of the great features I love about this car and the Traction control can be manually turnt off unlike some other vehicles. The exterior design of this vehicle looks great and I would recommend to anyone that can get one ! ","You cant ever have too much power, so by saying that maybe more power ! Bigger brakes for more quicker stopping response. Would like a more playful steering wheel cause it is abit lifeless. Besides that I love her !"
3.5,Frustrated & Deperate!,mandis ,06/29/2013,,,3,4,3,3,,4,4,4,3,I just started having steering problems. The steering wheel jerks hard while driving down the road and it feels like the steering is going out and I am going to loose control. When I come to a complete stop and let go of the wheel it starts shaking all by itself. It seems to only happen when I am driving it. I have taken it to a shop 2 times and both times they say there is nothing wrong. I am not imagining it and I am scared to death to put my kids in the car.

Despite that, this car is powerful, fast. The handling is great, and the car is fun to drive. I bought my car used and the cup holder was missing from the console, which sucks, but I'm over that.

Just recently started to have one issue with the car, cruise control occasionally does not work.  Have to take it in to get it looked at.  Other than that, no problems at all.

The traction control switch is under the armrest, the heated seat buttons are down low on the side of the seat, and the side mirror switches are too far away.

It looks great! I love the styling on the exterior and interior. It is fun to drive, responds well and looks way more expensive than it is. I wasn't able to find the color of car with all the features that I wanted so maybe if I did I would give it 100% but as it stands I can really only give it 92%. And here is why. Now depending on what you are used to the interior materials will look cheap or ok. I think the hard plastic looks cheap. And there isn't a gear indicator anywhere. The interior lights are orange which is hard to see when sunlight hits it.","The looks, it turns on a dime and it gets really good gas milage for being a V6 (although the response time could be slightly better. By bf has a Nissan Maxima and I can really tell the difference in the acceleration betwn his V6 and mine). LOVE the safety features! All in all I think it is great!","But in a gear indicator light, change the interior moldings from the cheap plastic, have a longer warrenty and the need assist grips above the doors.

It has all of the great GM extras and warranties, but not the price. I am very happy with my Saturn.

Fully loaded for less than any other vehicle in its class that I looked at.,Great design of the windows. Great visisbility. Anti glare mirrors are the best thing ever.,Leave headrests out of the backseats as they can create blind spots (I removed mine). Make a windshield wiper heater as an option. I live in Upstate NY and have owned 3 Saturns. I have had problems with the fluid freezing on all 3 of them. In Rochester the winter months are long & brutal.

It has a great engine, state of the art six speed transmission, and is a joy to drive. We use the remote start, heated seats, and excellent radio to enhance our car driving experience.

I am a GMS customer, and I got$5K rebate and some GM loyalty. But what a car at any price. Quiet and smooth. Love the tap shifting, and it can scoot.  Parked next to an $60K Audi S6, also black, and my Saturn got more attention and alot more walk arounds. But what I really like the most is the window sticker that says ""Built in Kansas City with 98% USA components"". The 3.6 V6 is manufactured at the Tonawanda NY engine plant, that GM spent $400 million renovating in 2000, with good high paying engineering & manufacturing  jobs.

Saturn sure has come a long way. Good power (although a little slow to react when you punch it). Little things I notice like some cheap plastics, and poorly fitting panels in the Aura.  Especially the door panels, and door sills, which get scuffed very easily. Shouldn't have that at this price point.  Seating is not as comfy as the Passat. I'm a taller guy, and trying to get a comfortable driving position has been a challenge. Curious to see what long road trips will be like.

I have gotten many compliments from coworkers and from people on the street about the new look of Saturn. The experience I have had as an owner has been nothing less than superb! I have scheduled appointments for regular maintenance with various dealerships and everyone has been friendly.  The only issue I have had thus far is a remote that worked at its own convenience. At the dealership, the service representative was friendly and swapped my remote while my oil was being changed.  I would truly say that this car is a very good buy.",The look of the car inside and out.,None at this time.

5,A Gem of a Car,Ron R ,10/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We absolutely love this car. Our previous vehicle was a Ford Explorer so it's been quite a change. Once all the comparisons were made in this class the Aura impressed us the most.We live in a hilly region so our gas mileage is only about 34 mpg hwy but still twice as high as our old Explorer.We just finished a 10 hour drive on our world famous Cabot Trail and this car stuck to the curves like glue.From a dead stop the 4 cylinder is a bit sluggish  (not for the lead footed drivers) but has more than enough power to pass anything on the highway. At over 6 feet tall it is true that getting into this car takes some getting used to but once inside the fit and finish is the best bar none.       ,"Love the interior and exterior design. Also enjoy the light show on start up as well as the ambient lighting at night. Satellite radio, Onstar, remote start and sunroof are nice touches as well. Another favorite feature of this car is that it is so rare to see one since it is only 2 years old.  ",Any improvements that come to mind will appear on the 2009 such as 6 speed transmission and Bluetooth for your cellphone.The car does have a couple of blind spots and maybe a rear view camera might help but the front pillars you will have to adjust to.    
5,This much fun for the money and mpg!,Carl T. ,10/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Test drove just about all mid size sedans and once I drove the Aura my mind was made up. Great style, profile and roomy interior. To top it all off a V6 getting over 30mpg. Saturn making big mistake not offering 3.5l in 2009 Aura XE. The 3.5l has plenty of power and I have no complaints with the 4 speed automatic transmission. I still can not get over the MPG, a pushrod power plant getting that kind of mileage. Handling is second to none, put all of these factors together and you have one fun sports sedan. You owe it to yourself to at least test drive and you will want one. Then compare price with other mid size sports sedan, you will be sold.","Exterior styling, roomy interior, 3.5 v6l power plant. Handling, really noise free.

I bought another Saturn because my first one was an excellent car. I have put almost 6,000 miles on the Aura and it has been smooth sailing all the way. People have asked me if it was a Lexus or Acura. The car rides smooth, handles well and is very quiet. The fake wood on the inside makes it look like a luxury car. The car is Red Jewel Tintcoat and it turns heads. The 4-cylinder has enough power merging onto the freeways as long as you turn off the A/C first. Plenty of power is available for driving around town. Fuel economy is good , 30 MPG on highway.  I love this car and would defintely buy it again.","The red jewel paint color, interior detail, OnStar, smooth ride and hubcaps that look like real rims. The standard stereo sounds good for a factory unit.",Have a gear selector indicator on the dashboard. Move the remote outside mirror control to the drivers door near the window control.

Before I decided on the Saturn Aura, I already tested a Saab 9-3, Mercedes C, Audi A4 and Lexus IS250. The Aura was roomier, quieter, more comfortable and almost as nimble as these much higher priced cars. It's fresh exterior has piqued the interest of many fellow motorists, who have stopped me in parking lots and at the car wash. To a person, folks were very impressed and even more so, when I told them the cost of my XR which is equipped with every available option Saturn offers.My other vehicle is a pricey foreign make yet I get as much a kick from the Aura as I do from it. ","Dual paddle shifters, 3.6 liter engine,power pedals, solid sound system,morocco leather interior, 18- inch, multi-spoke wheels, dual,chrome- tipped exhaust and ample interior and trunk space head the list of my favorite features.

Road noise is minimal - the first time we were on an extended highway drive, my husband noted that he could fall asleep it was so quiet...thank goodness I was driving.  Acceleration is fabulous, although with today's gas prices, I tend to conserve as much as I can now!  I would recommend this car to anyone - and it was fabulous in the snow this winter.

I like the stance and handling of the XR on its 18"" wheels. The performance is quick and responsive and I enjoy the paddle shift on the steering wheel. It's a bit tight to enter and exit but maybe that's just for me at 6'5"" tall. The insulated glass makes for a very quiet ride.

Getting 30 or 31 MPG just everyday driving. The OnStar and XM are great.  Major selling point for me was the traction and stability control.  We previously owned an 03 Hyundai Sonata that performed terribly in the snow. This V6 is very impressive.

The red exterior with tan cloth and faux wood interior is gorgeous, but some plastic bits are low end. Only the Morocco leather (which you cannot get on the 4 cyl) is better. This car rides smoothly, and is quieter on the road at 70 mph than the 2008 Accord and is about even with the 2008 camry I test drove. It's quick enough for us. The 5 year 100k standard drivetrain warranty should make for low hassle ownership.",Looks great. Has character; not sterile and common. Quiet.  Smooth. Price/financing very good. Warranty very good. Crash test results good. ,"Six speed auto that's in the XR instead of the four speed auto might add $500 to price, but worth it. Better interior materials and less cheap looking/feeling plastic might add $500. Driver's seat is hard, and even with 8 way adjust is not as comfy as mom's 25 year old Cadillac bench seat."

It was very dependable, so when it came time to get a new car I felt I needed to check the new Saturns. I test drove the Aura and it felt nothing like my LS.

I did not want a 4 cyl despite the price of gas. This car is amazing in every way. I will admit the ride is a bit stiff around local roads but like a Cadilac on the highway.

I have had a lot of trouble with the 19"" tires, dealer replaced all of them at least once, and they just cannot seem to get balanced smooth - the car rides crappy at 60MPH or higher, and I have been so disgusted with this that all the good things get overlooked. Its a shame, either the tires or my dealer can't get it right - they say its the way the car was designed-yeah right! GM always designs cars to vibrate at 60MPH","Exterior style, power, all the bells and whistles, fit and finish, decent economy, OnStar,ambient lighting, quiet with windows up (not so much with them down)",Power mirror and seat buttons are very awkward locations to reach.

4.875,"Great power, great ride, sporty design",Chicago Driver ,05/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The Saturn Aura has very good pickup and power for a relatively small sedan. All the comments about it being the ""poor man's Lexus"" are true. Several friends told me that they thought it was a Lexus. I had a Saturn wagon about 10 years ago and loved it, had a very good experience with the car. My take is that Saturn has upgraded their product line with a sporty, dependable line of cars that are popular and fun to drive. The only thing that bugs me about the car is that there appears to be a weird ""blind spot"" at the right front of the windshield due to the design of the front (windshield) of the car. But maybe this could be offset by adjusting the seat? Overall I love this car.","Great stereo. Holds the road very well. I love all the controls on the steering wheel, especially the information I can get by pressing the ""Information"" button on the steering wheel.

We drove the XR and found that there was too much torque and HP for our needs. Also, drove the Malibu. Chevy has more interesting interiors, but, the people at Saturn seem a bit more consumer friendly. The inline 4 has good power and the sound and vibration damping are really well done. ",Nice option packages make for some great features on this reasonably priced car.

I have been very picky about what to buy, because I tend to drive cars for several years. I drove the new versions of Mercedes C- Class, Accord, Camry, Passat, Saab 9- 3, as well as the TL and a Fusion. I couldn't decide on what I liked best. Then on the way home one day I saw a used TL sitting at a Saturn lot. I pulled in- didn't like it, then saw some promotions on the new Aura. I loved the way the car looked on the outside, but I am also no real fan of Saturn- in the past, they have had some of the ugliest cars on the road. Once I drove it, I knew immediately I would buy it that day. This is, hands down, the best car I have ever bought","I love the ""get up and go"" offered on this car. The exterior looks amazing and the interior finishes are similar to luxury imports. I love the Onstar and turn by turn navigation, built in xm and the leather is top notch.

I decided on a test drive and was again impressed by it's handling, the interior styling, and the available options. The XR had everything and even more than my 2001 Acura RL, including steering wheel paddle shift, adjustable pedals, and a separate rear seat audio system with wireless headphones.

I know they have made some minor changes to address a few issues for the 2008 model year and I hope they continue to do so for the 2009 model year to make this a nearly perfect midsize sedan.

It has a lot of nice unexpected touches- -the auto-up driver's window, interior ""mood lighting"", telescoping steering wheel, cargo nets.  Wasn't expecting any of that in this level Aura.  Interior is very quiet. 6- speaker stereo is above average for a base system. Large trunk. Good power. I really like the styling, one of my top reasons for purchase. It looks more expensive than it is.","Exterior styling, quiet interior, decent base stereo.

4.5,Euro feel from Kansas City,MT ,03/02/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"Saturn has successfully brought over the German essence of this car. The exterior is very striking - I've recently had a Passast, Audi A4 and Audit allroad. This compares well. The interior is close to these cars but a bit below - see first suggestion below. Fit and finish is so much better than any previous Saturn. Driving on both highway and back roads is a pleasure - good feel,quiet (except standard tires are not so quiet or good and there's maybe 2 aftermarket alternatives). Vision Ok but A pillar is obtrusive. The engine is very strong and works well with tranny. It is definitely a lot of car for the money and if you find the right combo of incentives/rebates it is a steal.","Good marriage between engine and tranny. Good road feel in the XR. Quiet cabin. Decent radio/XM. Good wheel based buttons - cruise, info system, radio, etc. TPMS. Adjustable pedals with tilt/telescope wheel makes finding a fit a breeze.

The caution of buying the first of a model year, albeit earning the Car of the Year Award, certainly holds true in the case of the XR.  The large number of problems in almost every system of the vehicle is indicative of getting the care to market before a full shakedown.

This is our 3rd Saturn and hopefully more to follow. ","Comfort, OnStar is great","Room for a regular spare tire, and not the donut!"
4.75,"Great car, ""This is a Saturn?""",Alex ,12/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"After 1000 miles I'm very happy with my Aura.  I compared Camry, Altima, Accord, Milan, and Legacy.  The Aura won easily for the best combination of styling, performance, and value.   I was very satisfied with the performance of the smaller V6 but wanted to get the dark interior with Moroccan leather which is not available on the XE.  Not too crazy about the auto dimming mirrors that keeps me from seeing behind me when I back out of my driveway due to my neighbors porch light. I'm not to keen on the automatic climate control, zero fan speed should mean fan off.  It still blows lightly meaning you have to play with the temp setting to avoid getting cooked or frozen).  I miss manual controls.","Heated seats, styling both inside and out. Good low end torque which allows decent acceleration without needing to rev the snot out of the engine. 29 to 33 highway MPG.  Kickin stereo. Excellent handling. smooth, quiet, powerful",Adjustable sensitivity on auto dimming mirrors as well as disable when in reverse. More manual control over the climate control system. Better city MPG. (only getting 12-15) Moraccan leather and dark interior available on XE 3 or 4 display lines for trip computer instead of only one.
5,Aura,dutchman ,11/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Excellent so far. Tire pressure monitor saved my tire. Good honest 29 mpg on highway.,Radio with aux input,Stiffer suspension
5,The Little Car Co. that Could and Did!,mary simmons ,11/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Aura's acceleration is extremely smooth. When I sit in the Aura it makes me feel like I'm surrounded in luxury and its so quiet, Saturn uses  Acoustic Laminated Glass to reduce wind and road noise contributing to a very quiet ride.      ",I would have to say I have a few favorite features like the heated seats and the remote start.,"They may only be one suggested Improvement that could be a plus, is having navigation as a option. "
2.125,Shoot the Ergonomics Engineers,TomNmd ,11/02/2007,,,1,3,3,3,,3,1,2,1,The remote mirror adjustment is in the wrong place -- can't sit in final position and adjust mirrors accordingly.  Put the compass and temperature in lower left & right of rear-view mirror -- can't see past rear headrests anyway. Heat the thighs - not just center of seat. Can't see any info when manually shifting (the tap shifter is a joke anyway). Can't get to pass- side rear seat storage (why is it recessed?) Itsy bitsy cruise-control and radio buttons and no cruise-control pause. Mirror dimmer doesn't dim enough -- manual would be better. HARD seats very uncomfortable.  Wish I hadn't bought this thing -- I hate every one of the 150 miles I travel each day! Feel like I'm getting bed soars.,"The tap shifters -- since the car shifts whenever it wants to anyway, I leave the car in Drive, and use the shift buttons to pretend they operate a machine gun like WW1 sopwith camel!","Make ergonomics engineers drive this piece of c++p for a couple of hundred miles. Then, start over! This is truly awful !!"
5,Awesome Car,Netray ,10/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"So far so good. I have owned 2005 VUE  for the past 2 years and it seem to be cheaply made, the Aura so far from I can tell is a well built car and worth the $21K, I looked at other cars with the same options that were in the $30K range and not as nice to drive, Saturn has a winner with the Aura. The Aura handle nicely and is very comfortable, seems to have a lot of power with good gas mileage, Very quite car when on the highway doing 80 mph, and big bang for the buck.","OnStar, great audio system. Great built in cell phone. Comfortable seats. Great dash displays.",Can't think off anything I would change! 
4.5,Great car,dirtytoliet ,10/27/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,We had a 2008 Saturn Vue and had problems so I took it back before the 30 day return was up and got an Aura. Best move I ever made on a car. The ride is great and if you turn the track control off you can leave smoke with the tires. Many people think its a Honda. And it cost many thousands less than a Camry. ,Love the heated seats and the foot pedals move that helps for my shorter than me wife. Rides so well.,Rear arm rest. Could use one more lower gear.
4.625,Nice ride!,techman3006 ,10/27/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I was hesitant to purchase a Saturn at first until a coworker talked me into visiting the dealership...I'm glad I did.  I'm very satisfied with my new car.  In two months of ownership I've actually had 2 different people stop me after parking my car so they could ask me about the vehicle (which is a first for me).  Anyway, the car is great and I'm very impressed with the performance, styling, features, etc. for the price.  It really does seem like it should cost around $10K more. The all around mileage has been decent (around 24.6 mpg) and it has been a joy to drive.  Didnt feel the extra $4K was worth it to go to the XR.. ",Styling - I've never had so many people stare at a car that I bought. Handling - very crisp and effortless. Peformance - Don't think you need the higher priced 6 cylinder engine as this car has more than enough get up and go! Fit and finish - things fit the way they should and looks good doing it,"Ease of entry - have to really bend to get into the car.  Also, I keep hitting a sharp corner on the main beam by the seat back when entering the vehicle. Tilt steering wheel - doesn't tilt up as far as my other vehicles making entering and exiting more difficult. "
4.5,Good bang for the buck,James Doerfler ,10/17/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,4,4,4,5,So far so good. I have owned Honda Accords for the past 15 years so this was a big departure from tradition. Time will tell if the reliability factor is there.,Looks are very good. Fit and finish are good. Performance is good. Value for the dollars seems above average and this vehicle truly fits the description of a sport sedan. This car is very quiet and has no rattles or squeaks. Gives me the impression of a more expensive vehicle.,Styling makes the car hard to get in and out of. Not a very easy vehicle to get in and out of due to the low lines of the door design. I don't know what the designers were thinking. 
4.875,So far - Great!,Joe ,10/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After test driving the alternatives, the Aura XR blew me away. I was a confirmed Toyota fan but the new Camrys and Avalons did not measure up. The Aura has been a pleasure to drive and the dealer experience great. Only time will tell if longer term reliability will rival the Toyota and Honda.",The 3.6 V6 and 6 speed transmission are well matched. The paddle shifters are a hoot. OnStar is neat. Good climate control. Seat comfort is very good.,"Cruise control is not as smooth as my 1999 Camry. Rear center arm rest needed. Left foot station/pad would be nice. ""Hang on"" handle for the front passenger."
5,Best in class,chrono ,10/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I did a lot of research before buying my Aura XR. I wanted to replace my boring 2005 Accord with something more fun to drive. The Aura did that and far exceeded my expectations. This car is on the same level as the Acura TL not Accords or Camrys. It's quiet, smooth, powerful and loaded with just about every option you'd ever need. This is my first Saturn but I anticipate staying with them for a very long time. ","252 hp DOHC engine from the CTS w/6speed and tapshift. Sport tuned suspension that isn't harsh. Laminated quiet glass, heated seats, auto dimming mirror, climate control. Safety features - Stabilitrak, 5 star crash test ratings, 3 sets of latch hooks for child seats.","Nothing really, maybe softer door handles. Please don't mess with the suspension tuning - it's perfect!"
5,My First Saturn,Nino D ,09/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I traded in my 2004 Honda Accord V6 after I drove the Aura.This car looks and drives better than my Honda It's a good value the build quality is excellent. Looks like it should cost more.,"OnStar, interior,","Glove box lock,center rear arm rest"
4.875,New Aura,Gary ,08/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This new Saturn did something that I thought would never happen, I bought a Saturn. After trading in my 2003 MINI I have not looked back. The Saturn is more pleasant to drive and certainly has more power. The switches and controls are much more intuitative and are easier to reach. The interior looks and feels like a much more expensive car. The body looks more German (in a good way) than a lot of German cars do. Is it as nice as a loaded 3 series BMW? No it isnt but at close to 20 thousand dollars less for a comparably equipped car it certainly is a bargain. If you want a sport sedan with a lot of comfort and luxury features at a fair price there is no other choice.","Power, styling and comfort.",A trunk pulldown handle and a better designed inside door pull would be great.
5,Aura owner ,ICOLBERT ,08/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I bought my Aura Xe and drove it from York Pa. to Albequerque Nm with out a hitch. Driving 70-80 mph with the cruise control on I got 28.7 mpg. This car is what an American car can and should be. This car is so quiet that you can not hear the windshield wipers working. I owned an SC1 for five years and the only money I put into that car was tires and brake pads. I will always be a Saturn owener because thay have earned my respect by producing a quality product.  ,I love my remote start ,
