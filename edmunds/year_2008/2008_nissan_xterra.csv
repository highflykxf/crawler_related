Not best fuel economy but with 4wd, that is what you expect. Only repairs have been bad bearings on front. Aside from that all routine maintenance. Just replaced the full suspension recently and the ride is much better now. The older it get, the move vibrations you feel, but mainly over 70 mph. Really vibrates after 80 mph, tried wheel balancing several time, breaks and alignments, but i think it is just its age now. Would recommend the truck, but am hoping they redesign soon before i buy another car. I am looking at 4 runners due to much better fuel economy on 4wd versions.",,

Surprised at it's speed, though, since it outsprints most family sedans to 60, and the 21+ gallon tank will last you 350-ish miles. Biggest problem are the rear seats.

It would be nice to have more features. The biggest disappointment was the terrible factory sound system. One of the first things I did was replace the radio and speakers with an aftermarket system.

As I have gotten older practicality and reliability are huge factors in my decision making now.  The Xterra is the best midsize SUV on the market.  It is also the best value.  Do your own research and see for yourself.  Depending on where you are in the country you should be able to get a new one at or under invoice if rebates are included.  Major improvement over the old body style and engines.  ,The 4WD is incredible for off roading and I do not even have the Off Road package.  Fuel economy is slightly better than advertised if you spend the majority of the time doing the speed limit.  ,The base radio can be improved but not a big deal.  A little more leg room in the back would be nice but I don't ride back there so not a big deal for me either plus I ride like a brother in a Cadillac with my seat back so my backseat passengers get the dirty end of the stick anyways.

After a really bad snow storm last December, I decided that owning a 4X4 vehicle is a MUST, so I purchased the Xterra. What a fun SUV to drive! Coming from a smaller car I was worried about its size and visibility, but after only a week of driving it, it felt like I've been driving it forever. It is fast on highway, and quick to respond in city traffic; smooth acceleration, great braking, not to mention the 4X4 performance in snowy conditions. Its gas mileage improved significantly from about 14mi/g to almost 17mi/g (I now have 3k miles on it). I truly like it!","I love its ground clearance and 4X4 for we have a cabin in the woods and a 1 mi dirt road/driveway to get to it. I also like the fold down rear seats, it gives you a lot of cargo space. I like the steel wheels, as I do not have to now worry about curb rash.","I would like a vanity mirror, I am after all a girl :-) and maybe lumbar support. After about 2 hours of driving my lower back starts hurting. "
4.875,Had to buy another one!,Sam Vega ,03/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought the first Xterra in May of 07. Loved it so much that my wife decided to trade in her Ford for another Xterra last month. ""Fun to drive"" is the best way to decribe it!",Handling and overall appearance.,Perhaps some pockets built into the back side of the 2 front seats for magazines or books storage for long trips. 
4.125,08 xterra off road automatic,Zee06Mikey ,03/25/2008,,,4,5,5,4,,4,4,4,3,"Truck is built very well.  Good brakes, handling and performance.  Seats are comfortable.  Paint and build quality is spot on perfect.  After a couple days of ownership noticed a rumble vibration at 35 mph and after a couple of trips back to the dealer service and driving other new ones all xterras 2008 seem to have this noise.  Hopefully there will be a TSB soon to address this noise. ","Bilstein shocks, wheels/tires, fit and finish, full frame, simple to change oil and general maintenance.  Good resale value.  Not another car with big tires.",Develop a fix for the rumble vibration problem at 35 mph.  Add manual locking hubs to improve gas mileage.   
4.375,2008 replacement of 2005,Spunoffandaway ,03/02/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"Another great car! The 2008 may be the last in this series, so I had to buy before they change it into a cross-over! I drive a lot of interstate miles, and feel safe with higher assurance of returning if hit. Sort of a small tank. No fear of muddy country roads with the great 4wd. Did have to give up a power plug for the MP3 plug-in (bummer)!The 08 has added XM radio and does offer some good entertainment while on trips. Almost same as 05, slight loss of build quality. Noticeable looseness in rear torque conversion around 35 mph or so, not in 05. Maybe it will go away with time. Still could not get side airbag option, must be a myth, like GPS. Not an economy car. Feels secure on the road.","Weight, height off road for visibility, fun truck to drive.","Add side airbags. Put the second power plug back on the dash, put small MP3 plug anywhere else. Put the 2005 drive train back in the rear. Also the 2005 QC checklist. Design the center armrest not for folks of average height. Also power seat with real lumbar support,or more adjustable at least. "
4.75,After 100 miles,Happysofar ,02/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Wanted the best of both worlds - hauling / towing power, decent fuel economy & off-road ability. Looked at the Toyota FJ which is not a vehicle for a family. Went back to Edmunds and saw the xterra FJ comparison.   Bought the X manual 6 spd. It drives very well, it's comfortable, great visibility & a fun ride.  Interior is more than sufficient for our needs. Not sure what the ""cheap plastic"" complaint means.  I can't see anything wrong with the vehicle - I really like everything about it.","All this truck under $20K with incentives is a great deal! Cruise, keyless entry on a bare bones model. This is a lot of truck!","Have roof crossbars included on the X package? I'll think about the improvements, but for now, it's looking hard to find any."
4.625,4 Guys and Their Stuff - Anywhere!,Xtrapol8 ,02/22/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"The FJ Cruiser and the 4-door Rubicon are both excellent vehicles that also have serious off-road capabilities and a manual transmission ... but I've made the right choice for me.    Three other 6' 200lb guys can accompany me into oblivion for a 5-day canoe trip and return home again nothing but pleased with the Xterra.  On the flipside, my 5'2"" 100lb wife and my 4 and 7 year old children love it too.  Soon I'll get some proper rock sliders that they can use as a step up into the truck.    For a truck that you sit ON and command, and that will do almost anything, the Xterra is remarkably quiet and easy to drive in town and on the highway.  High end stereo/CD/MP3/iPod helps too.  ","Ground clearance, ride height, seating position, visibility, versatility, torque, safety, attitude, shockworks.","Fuel econ. worse than advertised; OEM tires disappointing in snow; Not enough tow hooks; Make yourself a mat for the scratchy-slidy cargo area (<$20); Switches/knobs could be more substantial; ... and, without being greedy, that's about it."
4.375,2008 Nissan Xterra,Xtrapol8 ,02/16/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I am completely satisfied.  I can happily go canoeing virtually anywhere. X and I can return afterward to my wife and 2 small children and life is still great and still fully enabled.   Make yourself a mat for the back (<$20).   The Xterra's solid build quality, go-anywhere capability, versatile nature, and aggressive looks make it a must-drive if you're in the market.   This vehicle is what it purports to be - a means to an end... any end I choose.  ",Ride height & ground clearance; manual transmission; great visibiltiy; 4 full doors; usable cargo vol.; decent leg- room in 2nd row; 4wd; torque; form through function... and Attitude; Rockford Fosgate 6-cd & iPod stereo; abundance of safety features; audio on wheel; rugged suspension; Shrockworks!,Tow hooks @ 4 corners; OEM tires that are better in winter; more substantial switchgear like the FJ's; more lateral support in seats; fuel economy not as advertised but I'm at 5000km and it's winter;  electronic disconnecting swaybars; viscous coupling centre diff.; better winter wiper at rear.
4.875,Loving my Xterra,Daily Driver ,02/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased by Xterra in 12/07 and love driving it.  The whole family fights to get to drive it places.  On an average day I drive 50-80 freeway miles and 10-15 in the neighborhood.  I am getting 22-23 mpg.  I am getting better than expected, because I expected it to the 12-13 like my dad's Titan.  TPremium fuel helps dramatically on the Nissans, and most Nissan owner manuals require it.","The iPod interface, the rockford fosgate radio, XM radio, all the cargo storage, excellent peppy engine, gas mileage better than expected, sport look, this isn't your grandma's SUV.","Homelink garage door openers would be nice.  Would have liked the option for leather, but I don't do aftermarket leather."
4.125,More holes in your wallet,Sherpa ,02/02/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,3,5,"I got my '08 Off-Road edition in Dec 2007. I have driven it on both city streets and highway, and have been on a few long road trips.  For being a truck, Xterra offers a very comfortable ride.  At the end of my longest trip, six hours, I still felt very relaxed with no sore muscles.  On the highway, this vehicle will not disappoint you.  Those little hills on the highway won't be a problem at all and passing other vehicles is a breeze.  In the city, it's amazing.  If I am stopped at a light and the light turns green and I step on the gas, it just goes!  One thing I hate is the cold weather driving.  It feels a little sluggish until the engine reaches the optimal level. Waiting to offroad now.","Engine power, seating up high, amazing ground clearance, overall build quality, big off-road tires, 360- degree road visibility from inside, Off-Road controls (4Hi and 4Lo mode, rear-differential locker, downhill-assist although I haven't used the downhill assist feature yet), and the foldable seats.","Would love to see a diesel option, the rear passenger doors could be wider (have gotten complaints from the passengers that getting in and out is a little difficult), interior could use some brush-ups and have more fun and vibrant trim.  Sunroof option would be nice."
4.375,Lots of truck for the buck! Fantastic!,Bill ,01/22/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,3,5,"We've always been a Nissan family and bought our latest two, an '07 Sentra S (my daily driver) and '06 Xterra Off-Road (spouse's daily driver), in 10/06. While I rarely drove the Xterra, I loved being high up and having power to spare when I did, so much in fact that I just traded my Sentra for a '08 Xterra. Even the base trim offers great bang for the buck. The 4.0L V6 is a beast, the 5 spd A/T meshes well with it, and it came with standard features that not even my S trim Sentra came with, including cruise, ABS, VDC and EBD (traction control). It's my first SUV and my first RWD vehicle, but its dimensions are easy to acclimate to, and its handling, though still SUV- like, is quite confident.","High-up driving position makes me feel safer than I felt in my Sentra and gives a better view of the road, has power to spare, surprisingly agile and confident handling even with the base tires (General Grabber) and wheels (16"" steel), standard ABS/trac, red alert color is very sharp and gets looks!","Wish the seat height adjusted like our Off-Road, but not a deal breaker and the fixed height is fine; VDC could be a bit more forgiving in terms of allowing wheel spin when liberally applying gas from a stop; base HU should read MP3 CDs; better MPG would be nice but wasn't expecting great fuel eco."
4.25,"Not the ""family"" vehicle...",Family Guy ,01/17/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,3,4,4,"No question that the Xterra is fun to drive; it is rugged and has presence. Keep in mind that this SUV is built for an active lifestyle and all of its features and capabilities are on target. Vehicle handles well, sport-like in how responsive it is when weaving in and out of traffic. Smooth ride, even on uneven pavement. Truck-like in that the engine is more than enough output, very quick acceleration, powerful V6. Interior space is a bit tight, comfortable for 4. Cloth seats are comfortable and make sense for those X-treme adventures. You are seated high in the cabin, but rear seats are too upright. Lots of plastic used in the interior, but it's the best (real) SUV bargain. ","Storage configurations, impressive towing capability, offroad prowess, decent gas mileage.","Too much plastic in the cabin, lower panel underneath steering wheel hinders available leg room, not enough space in storage compartments, dash/display is unappealing."
4.5,X-tra Special Xterra 2008,Debbie ,01/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,1,5,I truly love the way the X-Terra handles and drives compared to the 2003 I had.  I like it being bigger and wider.,"The bluetooth, stereo, all the little things they added to the 2008.","I just found out two weeks after I got mine that the GPS system comes in them, but was not offered to me.  That would have been nice to have.  Very disappointed in the gas mileage.  Mine is like others that I have read, I am only getting 11-12 miles per gallon.  Nowhere near 16."
4.875,"Quality, Real Sport Utility Vehicle",Daily Driver ,12/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Sturdy, truck frame, doesn't feel like a delicate car whose suspension has been raised and given 4WD. Inspires confidence in bad weather and on rough trails.  Fun to drive in the snow and slush!  Feels safe.  VDC works well when roads are slick. Good ground clearance with key components tucked up under the frame. Excellent acceleration. Very responsive engine and transmission. Quiet on the highway.  Comfortable for four on a trip.","Powerful engine, responsive steering and handling, maneuverability, how quiet it is on the hwy considering this is a rugged, adventure oriented vehicle. Versatile interior for real outdoor enthusiasts. Plenty of head room. Mileage is good for full frame (heavier) and performance of vehicle.",Diesel version with even more torque.
4.75,The ride you have been waiting for,Coach C ,12/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I recently traded in a ford escape (02) for my new Xterra.  After researching I decided that this was the suv for me.  I love the power and so far it has handled well in the snow and ice.  I am impressed, so far, with the build quality.  I have only had the car for about 6 weeks but so far I am extremely impressed.",The power. The rockford fosgate system. Steering controls. Build quality.  ,"My only complaint is the gas mileage, however I knew it was bad before buying."
4.25,"Could be perfect, but needs some tweaks",Vincent Johnson ,11/19/2007,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,2,5,"The 08 Xterra Off Road is almost the perfect SUV for those of us who use it like a sport utility vehicle. It will go almost anywhere you want it to. It does ride more like a truck than other SUVs, but it also looks less like a minivan than other SUVs. You also feel like you're in a truck. The ground clearance is nice (no sharp corners anymore) and the seats make you feel like you need to duck when going into the garage. The horse power is more than you ever need on a daily basis. This is truly a rough and rugged truck.  My biggest disappointment with the Xterra has been the estimated gas mileage. Sticker says 16/20, but it's more like 12/16. I get 15-16 at best on the highway.","Bluetooth hands free, Rockford-fosgate sound system, off road suspension, overall exterior look, brush guard add on, sunglasses holder, storage area tie downs.   The way I look in it!","Rear view mirror limits peripheral vision, center arm rest is to far back, all window buttons should have auto up and down, how is there no GPS package? Gas mileage is nowhere near what is advertised. Seats can be rough on long trips. XM radio? But no HD radio?"
