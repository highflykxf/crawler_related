5,Best Car I ever Owned!,Neil Kamichoff ,01/14/2016,3,5,5,,,4,5,5,5,,,"The M35 of this 2008 - 2010 generation is one of the most solid cars I have ever owned (Yes, I've owned, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lincoln and Cadillac, among others).  Only downside to this car is that it's a bit thirsty.  Over many, miles we've been averaging 19-20 MPG.  However, this is probably the last series that still runs on REGULAR gas....and runs well.",,

I love it except...all the maple moldings on the inside of the doors had to be replaced (turned out to be bad glue).Infiniti had no problem replacing them.At 65K miles the front left wheel bearing went.Haven't ever had that happen on any other car.At 80K miles the transmission went - not in any forward gear, but in reverse? I generally keep my cars for 150K miles and I've never had transmission problems or even had to change a clutch. Needless to say, I'm disappointed.","The ride comfort is great.

I guess they got it right with the 2010 with the 7 speed trans.  However, the ride quality is very poor especially on uneven roads.  I can first feel every bump then the front ends starts rattling and jumping.  When I first noticed it I felt like the car was going to lose control.  since then I can control it.

Every time I drive it, the high quality interior, the quick acceleration, the sharp handling, the easy-to-use controls and the OUTSTANDING sound system featuring the music box (no more CDs!,) tell me that this is the car for me. I'm 6'5"" so comfort is important to me. I always feel comfortable, even after driving 2-3 hours straight. Gas mileage could be a bit better, but it's not a deal breaker.

Response is quick and braking is very good too!  The only slight disappointment is road noise but that is expected considering the performance handling assets.  Overall, the car is unbelievably quick and the Bose sound system is one of the best I've ever seen in a luxury vehicle.  We've only put 10K miles and dependability seems to be there.  Dealing with the dealer on maintenance issues has been pleasant but not cheap.  I would recommend this vehicle for one whose tired of the basic economic family car, tired of the SUV mode, and the best value.","Our favorite features are the stereo system, powertrain (power when you need it), and the interior features are awesome too.",A sixth gear transmission that would drop RPM's and improve gas mileage.

Anyway, I walked into the Infiniti dealership here and the friendliness was fabulous. They had an 08 M35x that the manager was driving with 18,000 kms in sandstone.  What a beautiful car. We drove it for a day and were hooked. They gave it to me for 20K less than new. They gave me 10K for my Buick and I was stunned. I drove this out of there in mint condition for 30K Canadian.

Drove it home in a snow storm and the all wheel drive is excellent. The command center is filled with everything you can imagine. Jukebox, Ipod integration, satellite radio, CD. Rides out great. Very luxurious interior and the 3.5 really moves when you need to. I have only put about 6k on the car so far, but love it. As soon as my wife's lease is up on her car she wants the G37x.","Nav system, Music studio, back up camera and the heated and cooled seats.",The only thing I wish the car had was the self locking feature for when you take off - the doors should lock automatically. With the Infiniti's they do not do that. The turn signals could use some tweaking as well. Unless it is a full 90 degree turn the signals do not go off. 
4.375,"Excellent Electronics, Poor Handling",NAIHOXI ,03/16/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,3,4,"The M35 AWD is an electronics powerhouse with an amazing array of safety and convenient features. Unfortunately, it suffers from a serious steering problem, called tramlining, which makes the handling not only unsatisfactory but also dangerous. I replaced tires twice before I learned from a conscientious mechanic of an Infiniti dealership that the problem is with the steering rack, which Nissan refuses to replace.

The Infiniti held its own against these three fine vehicles, both on performance and luxury comparisons.  Both the BMW and the Mercedes are excellent vehicles, but comparably equipped would have cost me $10k to $15k more.  The TL costs slightly less, but felt a little smaller and although design tastes are subjective, I liked the M's feel much better.","Navigation, great performance, luxurious interior.",Improved fuel efficiency.

We were looking at Honda CRVs and other mini SUVS (loaded). I hate SUVs and convinced my wife that this was the car to buy - and now she loves it.  The driving experience is almost as good as the BMW 745, and it has a ton of features.  I recommend the base model because the sport model has a really stiff ride.  It has a nice, isolated yet sporty feel.  For the money, I don't think you can beat it.  Against its competitive set, it is a good value and a great car, but at the prices you can get now it is probably unbeatable.","Nice leather, hands free blue tooth, acceleration, roomy, relatively rare car","Slightly better gas mileage, but it is a performance car, iPod hookup should be standard in this car - not an option"
4.375,Good in almost all aspects,Pinspector ,12/13/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,2,4,"We bought the M35x in October which means it was almost last years car. Problem was tramlining, or the movement of the car over uneven pavement.  Ever drive on a highway that's been used by a lot of trucks. This car will jump all over the place. I researched and got the tires replaced with Michelins by dealer.  Tramlining decreased by about 75%!  Yes, this car eats gas.  My 04 Murano with same VQ35 engine gets a lot better mileage.  A lot more comfortable than our 2003 Mercedes C320 and hopefully a lot more reliable. I didn't want AWD but in NJ all that's available is AWD.  Too bad!",Navigation is great.  Audio system is tops.

Then again, this is a sports car, and performs like one too. The interior is beautiful, the navigation is nice, and the rear seat room is actually quite good. HOWEVER, this car is a gas machine. If you want a fuel efficient car, look toward buying maybe a GS.

The M35 feels solid with predictable handling, and the optional technology and advanced technology packages round out the car well.  While not as quiet and smooth as the E350, it's a solid car with respectable performance and comfort.  Reliability likely won't be a concern, with a standard 60K mile warranty.  Wind noise is somewhat noticeable at highway speeds, gas mileage a bit disappointing, and the performance tires transmit some road noise into the cabin.  But for the deals that Infiniti is offering right now, it was simply a no-brainer.  A fine car and a no-regrets purchase.","Value, power, attractive real wood trim.

My previous two cars were an 04 Acura TL and 01 BMW 530i.  I considered the Lexus GS and BMW 528i.  The Lexus was not sporty enough and the BMW was not as good a value.  With the Tech and Sport package this car has all the goodies I wanted at a great price.  This is a car my whole family likes.  Plenty room in the back for my thirteen year old daughter and her friends.  All the technology a thirteen would want.

4.375,Almost there,Jes ,09/09/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"This car is almost perfect if you want a more sporty ride.  The suspension, gearing and exhaust all are more sport oriented than the Lexus type comfort some may anticipate.  The steering is the only non-sporty aspect of the M35.  It is overly sensitive and loose at center.  Constant correction is required at highway speed.  The V6 leaves you wanting at times, but that is why they offer a V8.  The car needs more gears.  The new FX 7 speed transmission should fix this.  The M35 cost less than some of its competitors but I think it lacks a few features if you look closely.  Infiniti is learning and will pull it all together with the next iteration.","Appearance, comfort, interior room.  Performance is great minus the steering.  The power is good without a load up to about 80 MPH.  Braking is very solid.  ","A/C is overly sensitive to sunlight, new transmission, tighten steering, save the deep exhaust for the sport model, add auto-lock, nix the bar graph fuel economy display, rear folding seat to trunk would be nice.

There's room for five and large trunk and a great sound system.  My only complaint is the awful gas mileage.  In the city it averages a bit over 14 and on the road barely 21.

The build quality is outstanding and the ride (non-sport) is very comfortable.  Reports have indicated that road noise at speed is more than it should be.  I think most cars with sport tires and wheels of this design will transmit a bit more noise to the cabin at speed.  It isn't enough to even be concerned with unless you are an absolute freak about total silence.  The exterior design is eye catching and the interior is by far the most impressive I have seen in any car.  The drop in Lexus reliability and the unsubstantiated excessive cost of the BMW, took those two off my list early.  A great car and a real value.","The handling and ride are top notch.
