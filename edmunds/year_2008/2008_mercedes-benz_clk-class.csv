5,Fine Car,Richard Pendleton ,11/19/2015,4,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"This car is  not designed and manufactured to the high standards of my prior MBs (2008 CLK350, C350 Sta Wgn 2004).The roof control switch does not allow opening in the vent position with the sun shade close (as my Volvo does).The rear bumper does not have a protective top strip (as the ML series does).With approx 2700 miles, the car has rattles emanating from the cabinAlthough mounting points are presenting the inner roof liner a divider is not available  (as with the ML series).The cup holder sub assembly is cheaply made out of plastic.A cover is not available for the rear  bench  seat to protect the leather from dog wear  and tear.Positive points are acceleration, gas mileage, and cabin sound  proofing.",,
4,"Bad compressor at less than 50,000",cberk74 ,10/11/2014,,,5,5,3,3,,5,3,3,5,"My compressor has gone bad 49,582 miles. The car may be 6 yrs old but at that low mileage it should not have a compressor leak. It has been properly maintained at Mercedes dealerships and garage kept. I am the fourth owner. Had it for two years and average 10,000 a year in mileage. I have only had to visit the dealership twice for service and apparently do not have enough ""loyalty"" to get a decent repair rate on something  that should not be broken. I spoke with the head of the Post Warranty at MBUSA and he spoke with my local service center. The best deal they could offer me was 15% off the $1500 repair bill. I am very disappointed in the quality of the car. ",Looks beautiful and classy. ,Use higher quality parts. 
3.5,Poor reliability,qualitypro ,10/10/2013,,,3,5,1,1,,5,4,4,5,"After owning a CLK-350 for 2 months, my average maintenance is $600 per month. Two manufacturing defects, beyond the warranty cost $600 each to fix. A noise from the A/C compressor clutch (bracket?) was repaited,Secondlt, a month later, the Tire Pressure warning came on. I reprressurized 4 times. Rgen the dash indicator turned red for tires. Next the dash said SRS malfunction. The dealer says wiring under the sets is defecrive and seats need to be removed, etc. This follows an experience with a 320E which was disastrous, window falling, etc.Last Mercedes.",Great when it runs.,Meet Kia warranty.
5,"Wow, it's a super car!!!!!",gambler695 ,04/15/2012,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"You need to own and drive this car. The clk 550 is very fast, the clk63amg is a beast, it's actually will frighten you with 475 hp and 465lbs of torque. I love it, and the engine sound especially top down makes you grin from ear to ear. It even has 4 useable seats and my twin daughters love riding in it. The diamond silver metallic color looks very unique and the car is a discreet head turner. Really no negatives to this car other than price and you get what you pay for with this car. It will be very rare because only 250 ever sent here. Highly recommended, best car by far I have ever owned!","The AMG 6.2 liter engine, great brakes, sound system, top, etc, etc",None
4.875,Benz is Best,Mr Bill ,07/30/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've owned just about everything but truly exotic cars, i.e. Ferrari, Rolls, Bentley, Maserati, etc.  This Benz, with the 5.5 liter engine, is one of the most powerful cars I've had.  The styling appeals to women of taste and the performance appeals to anyone who likes gobs of horsepower, push you to the seat acceleration and so on.  I believe this car will become a collector's edition over time.  Mine is white, with light beige seats and a black top.  At gas stations people almost always say, ""What a beautiful car"".  There are more expensive convertibles, but few with the ""wow factor"" of this vehicle.","Styling, power, handling, sound system, ride, build quality.",Better Nav system.  Lower maintenance costs. M-B dealers extract blood from you when it's service time.
4.875,CA Dream'in,Rob4USC ,10/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Although I was initially concerned about the mpg, that's become a non- issue.  The performance, sound system and luxury is outstanding.  The seating for four works, allowing the entire family to cruise PCH and enjoy the weather.  Highly recommend this car.","Speed, performance, speed, performance and sound system.",Locking compartments.  You can't use the trunk for everything.
4.875,Lean mean machine,Dr. Frank ,04/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,This car is fun. Great performance. The power is there when you need it.The handling is great.The braking is great.Above all you feel safe in this car.I have no complaints about quality.It's all built in.I'm holding on to this one.It's the first of my future collection.,"Handling,sound system,safety and it does turn heads.",Sometimes seat belt retraction fouls up. I  cracked my speaker cover in the door because I closed the door and the buckle wedged between the seat and door. I don't know what can be done there but it needs attention.
4.75,CLK 350 Coupe,PW ,11/25/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"Great car, sound system is great, great acceleration. I'm glad the Premium package I for 2009 has bluetooth since I live in CA. Great improvement.","Cupholders are better than in the BMW 328I, full seat pockets not netting, substantial seatbelt arms, memory seats for passenger, smooth ride, great leather quality, great styling, more passenger AC options.","Touchscreen navigation system, ipod connector in the center console, better cornering, song name and artist on display, song info for ipod on display, tighter braking, control for moving front seats backwards/forwards next to seat lever on top. "
4.75,First Convertible,ECB ,05/17/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"First convertible and I love it! Really wanted a metal top, but wound up trading our 2005 E320 4-matic for the rag top at the dealership. Liked the SLK (metal top) but felt it was too selfish with only 2 seats, but have never used the back seats!","Just a fun to drive car and I have the top down as often as possible. Left it in Florida for the winter months up North, got 28 MPG on the trip back.",Cup holder locations are terrible. Navigation system entry should be more friendly (not the joystick). Car was supposedly wired for Bluetooth (P1 package)however it is still a $1000 option to get it implemented (found out after purchase!). Need the option to turn off the rearview/side mirror dimming.
4.75,2008 CLK550 Coupe,JP ,05/16/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just a great car! Performance is amazing, handling is excellent without sacrificing too much ride quality, and the brakes are phenomenal. I bought the car 4 months ago and am averaging 18mpg, pretty good for 5.5l V8. Bizarrely this is better mileage than I got from my 2005 C320. My only complaint is that sometimes the transmission gets confused, especially if flooring the throttle at around 20-25mph. There is a noticeable lag before things start happening. Also watch it in the rain, it will spin the rear tyres at 70mph under full acceleration. ",Performance & great looks.,Transmission programming. On-board computer needs update.
4.875,Awesome,MLP ,05/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Having owned several performance Mercedes over the yrs including the SL series, the CLK 550 is proving to be the best road machine I have ever driven. Mechanics wedded to aesthetics.","Responsiveness, looks, and fun",Lock on glove box. There is no secure place in the cabin!
5,A good mix of power and luxury,K. Lee ,04/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a great car. I moved up from an Acura CL-S, so it was an upgrade on all fronts. The acceleration is silky smooth.  For the most part, the engine is quiet but still can let out that great sounding growl when you really jam the pedal. There's no cooler sound than rolling through a short tunnel and hitting the gas just before the mouth  It's like a sonic boom!  Mine is fully loaded, with the P3 package and just about every option available. I think the P2 package is enough though, and you don't need silly options like the automatic trunk opener/closer.","I would highly recommend getting the 550 over the 350. This stout engine is really worth it. Whether it's from a dead stop or already going 60 on the highway, you always have a ton of power in your back pocket whenever you need it. With its top down, the CLK has few rivals in terms of looks.",I think the navigation system needs some work. My Acura's nav is much more intuitive and useful (and it's 8 years old).  It needs to be a touch screen as entering addresses takes forever using a joystick. Sound system needs a little tweaking.  I like my Acura's Bose better than the HK.
4.875,Fantastic except for the bad paint job,David Edwards ,01/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded in my 2007 SLK that I had purchased new in March of 2007.  It was a nice car, but tight on space and not very comfortable.  The CLK Cabriolet is fantastic.  The seats are the most comfortable I have set in ... even better than our 2008 Lexus LS 460.  The Harmon Kardon stereo is incredible.  The ride is crisp yet smooth and it literally glides over the roads.  Some of the speakers vibrated at first with any significant bass, but this seems to have subsided quite a bit.  The Irridium Silver paint is beautiful in lower light or artificial light, but in sunlight, you see the problems with the metallic paint...looks like it was painted with a spray can.  Moral, don't buy on a cloudy day.","interior comfort and high quality leather, great stereo, fantastic handling, a bargain for the performance and comfort, top is smooth and opens and closes quickly, very little windnoise (compared to the 2008 Lexus in the next garage bay that has a lot for a $73K car...Germans are still the best!","Need to work on the quality of the metallic paint, truly an embarassment to Mercedes...need to get rid of the rest of the Chryler influence there...Where is the blue tooth?  What is this with a 900 charge for the ability to couple your phone with the car?"
4.75,Nice Convertible,Joe S ,01/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,My very first convertible and what a beauty!  We actually had the opportunity to drive with top down in January during an unusual 70 degree day in New Jersey and it turned heads! ,"Sound system, Mercedes quality and reliability",C'mon Mercedes - you really need to find a better place for the cup holders. More colorful/detailed Navigation system (Sold my Acura RL which had a tremendous Navi display) and 1 year subscription to Sirus instead of the lame 6 months (we are talking about a $60K car)
5,A Bargain for $60 K,David E ,01/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I had owned numerous BMWs and bought a new 2008 Lexus LS460 recently.  I traded in a 2007 Mercedes SLK on this 2008 CLK to have more room and comfort.  This car is so far ahead of the competition that its not even funny.  The seats are amazingly comfortable.  The top operation is flawless.  The interior design and comfort exceptional.  The Irridium Silver paint seems a bit splotchy in bright light.  The ride quality is excellent.  The handling is tight, much better than that of the SLK.  I am very impressed with this car!  A+++","Transmission, comfort, incredible H/K stereo, fantastic seats, supple leather, tight handling!",Paint finish needs work..Lexus finish much better. Some rattle in the front speakers. Needs automatic opening trunk
5,Black Series - Unbelievable Car,JDB ,12/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This limited production car is truly a unique experience.  The acceleration is impressive, but the handling is the vehicle's true standout.  The individually adjustable coil-over suspension allows one to not only adjust the ride height, but also the compression and the rebound of the shocks to tailor the handling to your individual taste.  The AMG Performance Studio really outdid themselves when the produced this wonderful example of their capabilities.",This car sounds like no other Mercedes.  I love the way the engine sounds when the start button is depressed.  Pure fun!,
4.75,Step above the rest,JOHN S. ,11/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"This coupe will turn you into a racecar driver.IT has the same engine as the S class with a fraction of the price.This car really has it all, from it's 8 cyinder engine to it's body sculpted desing that has AMG written all over it. When night arrives is when the fun begins.  It's very spacious cabon has all the bells and whistels to make your drive extremely fun.Whether you are looking for nav, keyless go, heated  seats this car has it all. I will have to agree with Mercedes Benz quote. In a perfect world everyone would own one. Moreover, not everyone is going to agree with me, but that is the people who does not own one. As having a great affinity for cars especially coupes this one has it all","The speed and its spacious cabon.  Most coupes are small inside, however, not this one.",Nothing. The car is already 10 years ahead of its time.
