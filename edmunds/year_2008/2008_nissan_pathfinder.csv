Class action lawsuit resulted and Nissan ""slithered out"" of responsibility with clever lawyers.  Result was only a fraction had a small portion of the actual cost covered.  Very few of the thousands of affected Nissan's got a small percentage of the cost covered.  The real sad issue is that Nissan did everything possible to NOT stand behind their products.  It is an unhappy tale that so many thousands of Nissan owners were abandoned when this problem happened.  Even the dealers are ashamed of Nissan.",,

4.75,Driving in NY city,alainw ,08/19/2011,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,I own a 08 LE and an 1998 LE pathfinder. The 08 has 16k miles on it and the 98 110k. They both are great but absolutly not comparable.The LE also has the navigation and DVD package. I never was able to achieve better than 12m/g in the city in any condition in the 08 where it is 16 m/g on the 10 years older PF. My 39 m lease on the 08 will finish in 7 weeks and I will bargain buying it from Nissan Bank. Having said that I am definitly pleased overall. But I still prefer the built and drive of the 10 years older PF (08 is built on a truck frame while 98 is a car based SUV). I find that nothing is plastic inside of the latter and the plush carpet and in it are better quality. ,"Looks, kelyess, music box, navigation, acceleration and speed. No problem with anything. Doesn't dent easy at all (having witnessed repeatedly people opening their car doors on my car enough to rock the car but no dent it. Excellent AWD feature. The front seats are very comfortable. No transmission problems or feeling the road like some other reviewers. No leaky roofs or falling ceiling. Very very quite cabin. Superb power for a 6cyl can accelerate my way 8 lanes right post toll to make a near missed exit without compromising on anyones safety or driving. It's great on bumps and potholes, never slowed down and never broke anything.","DVD can't be started unless u turn of the car or may be this is the only way to reset it. Voice recognition is useless always in error, while on infinity cars it never second guess you.
The second row seats is loose, their is a humid smell when u fist turne the A/C. Paint scratch very easily. The 98 low gear is better and the older truck did much better in the 12/26/10 NY storm. I hope the 2013 path is rebuilt after the 98 to 2004 pfs and I will definitly buy it. I can't believe the the 98 is much better on fuel.

On trips I've averaged 23 mpg.  Hope this is helpful.  I chose the Pathfinder over the 4 Runner because of the deal.  About four thousand cheaper and the base 2008 4 runner didn't even have the 3d seat as standard.  Towing capacity was 1K more than the V6 4 runner.  So glad I picked the Pathfinder.,Everything.

I have owned new vehicles every two years for the last 40 years and this is the most reliable constant vehicle that I have ever owned.

Only trouble has been limited to dead battery when the headlight ""auto-off"" feature stopped on occasion leaving technicians scratching their heads, and a faulty doorlock on passenger door made it impossible to exit vehicle from the back seat.

Backup camera is great with kids/dog,"Rugged interior. Rear heat/air vents. Nice wide and tall doors. Backup camera on the SE model. Better gas mileage then my Jeep Grand Cherokee. Better ride then my Jeep (if you are complaining about the truck like ride on this SUV then do not buy a SUV. Buy a car!

I had the opportunity to drive from Northern Alberta through the Rockies to Vancouver shortly after I took delivery of my new Pathfinder.  The V8 power, all wheel drive and luxury appointments made for a great trip and despite the blinding snowstorm and icy conditions it was a very reassuring knowing I was driving a Pathfinder. No problems and the handling was excellent along the way.  I can hardly wait until summer. By the way gas mileage was above my expectations as was price vs value.  ","Heated steering wheel, seats, shifttronic, all-wheel drive, sound system, display and all around luxury appointments. Power and handling were exceptional as was the traction control system.

5,The perfect mix,Cesar ,11/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We bought the 2008 Pathfinder having in mind we travel to Mexico at least once a year and we needed a vehicle reliable on seriously hard roads. This one didn't disappoint. Its off road ability it's outstanding. Plenty of power for anybody and decent fuel economy. On the city, it delivers a quiet and smooth drive.

The ride is very smooth and very quiet but powerful. We wanted a vehicle that was safe for Michigan winters so we chose a 4x4. We wanted to be able to move out on the freeway and this has a lot of power off the block as well as when you need to pass. We need a quiet interior as we do a lot of business in the car and it is super quiet. The majority of the driving I have done is in town and I am pleased to be getting 18.1 miles per gallon. My husband just loves the look of it. It's beefy but still easy for me to get in and out of.,Small turning radius for such a large truck. Easy to use cup holders. Change compartment in the front. Easy to use radio. Two trip meters. Seats fold down individually and very easily. Two glove compartments is handy. ,The seat belt hits me at the wrong place. Nice if it could be movable. A little more leg room in the second row seat would be an advantage. It's even tight for my briefcase.

I got the loaded version and it has been totally worth it.  The voice recognition works really well and the navigation system is excellent.  I didn't realize that I would like the keyless feature as much as I have.  I've gotten so lazy that it now irritates me to have to get my key out when I drive my other car.  It has a lot of nice touches both inside and out and I have absolutely no buyer remorse!","Navigation system, rear view camera, keyless feature, heated seats, music memory (flash drive, hard drive and MP3 capabilities), on-board computer is sensational and overall interior design.","I read places that it would drive rough at 40 mph, especially after it got worn in.

Traded in my '05 350z for my Pathy, and I'm not one bit sorry. Was looking at the 4runner, but that interior was archaic. The Pathfinder is smooth, has a great leather interior, awesome handling and the rear view cam on the SE is GREAT! 3rd row stays folded down - we don't need it, and it's laughable anyhow.

The exterior styling is commanding yet sleek; great ground clearance; and I was pretty pleased that the hitch was standard on the one I bought. I've seen some Pathfinders around with these weird contoured pinstripes, but mine doesn't have that fortunately. Even for a base model I was pleased with the remote keyless entry, power windows, locks and tint. It rides much smoother than my Rodeo (and the Lincoln Aviator and Acura MDX which I've driven), but not quite as nice as the Lexus GX470. The rear seats are a bit tight, but we just put the kids back there anyway.","Exterior styling, good storage, fold flat rear seats, smooth ride, tight turning radius, fair fuel eco for an SUV of that size (I average 18 mpg)","Doors do not auto-lock when moving, rattling and LOUD wind noise when rear windows are the only ones lowered, the doors open a bit too wide and it's a stretch to close the door every time, tailgate lifts too high to open in garage; transmission ""thunks"" loudly when changing between gears (P, D, R)"
5,"Best vehicle, best value for me",eschool ,08/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Very impressed with this vehicle. V8 is powerful and surprisingly economical. Interstate Hwy driving at 78 mph at barely 2000 RPM and getting 18.6 mpg is great for me.  I pulled a trailer home at a safer slower 70 mph and still got 17.5 mpg. Nimble as my 2001 Cherokee and as powerful as my 2005 Titan.  I would not have bought if the Pathfinder SE did not have the V8. I found one of the last ones they made in the SE model.  I'm 65 and have seen gas prices go up and down many times.  This is a good time to buy. ,"Big V8 engine with DOHC and 32 valves. Great engine.  Beats all the Detroit powerhouse engines hands down in low speed torque, reliability, service life, and economy. V8 drive train is excellent and I think gas mileage will be same as V6 with proper driving technique.",Inside arm rests like on my Titan.  Do not make it any wider or longer.  Armada is available for those wanting bigger size.  Towing mirrors would be nice to have.
3.5,Buy a 4Runner,Adam ,08/04/2008,,,4,5,1,4,,4,4,2,4,"Was choosing between this and 4Runner.  Chose Pathfinder because of option availability and price.  At 7000 miles headliner (ceiling) started falling out.  Took to dealer and they replaced the entire ceiling.  Second ceiling was full of creases and looked far worse so it went back for a third time.  They had it for five days and it came back with many faults.  Stains on sunroof, ill-fitting, scratched, and broken trim.  I am waiting new parts on back order so it can go back again and they can fix all the interior bits they broke.  It will never be right again.",Comfort and price for the features.  ,Interior build quality is not there.  Plastic trim scratches far too easily.

I still sometimes surprise myself with its power when I pull out into Atlanta traffic.  the V6 has plenty of power, don't regret not getting the V8.  Overall, I love this car until I have to fill it up!  I'll probably go back to a smaller car or wagon next time given the price of gas.",The room and the standard trailer hitch for my bike rack have been great.  I LOVE the XM Radio; never listen to regular radio anymore.  The power and the smooth ride are wonderful.,"I do have the problem with the windows rattling wen they're half open.  I HATE the power memory- seat.  Tried to get the dealership to run it off but they didn't know how, even thought he manual says they can; I gave up on that one.

But I've never been impressed with how it handles.  Hit a pot hole and the thing feels like you could lose control.  Lots of air bags and feels solid - think it would survive a crash okay.  But there is something about hitting potholes.  It's very roomy and I love the interior.  Huge display screen is great!  Only other bad thing is the gas mileage.  A year ago that wasn't a problem for me.  Now I'm having second thoughts.  At only 16 mpg, it certainly isn't cheap.  ",Interior design. Exterior color options.,Stability and control.

Therefore I have had ample opportunities to evaluate it and am on the whole satisfied with this SUV.  Being a previous Toyota sedan owner, I was choosing between the 4runner and Pathfinder. I feel completely comfortable with the choice I made as the 4runner did not feel luxurious enough from inside and had horrible 3rd row seating option.  Now to more details on my experience with the pathfinder - the driving experience is great, interiors have a plush feel, rear view is awesome, sound system is good and overall car experience has been great.","Rear view, system monitor, Bose sound system, fold flat 3rd row, plush interiors, great driving experience and secure feel on the road, v6 power, cruise control, steering wheel audio controls, 2wd/auto/4wd selector, rear air conditioning controls, climate control and overall look and feel of car.","Gas mileage feels low, increase fuel tank capacity, less storage space in a large SUV (less than camry), driver memory system (feel the seat take different positions at various times), doors do not auto-lock when moving (why wouldn't Nissan have this imp feature!), stiff suspension & bland key fob."

I cannot even open mines. When I told the dealer, they said never heard of the problem and cannot do anything. Just had a recall for the clock, giving wrong time every now and then. Also the power seats are always being touched every time I enter or on the way out of the vehicle causing the seats to be re-set every time.  ","Color, style sound and screen.

Basically it clunks if you go on and off the gas when travelling around 40mph.  I drive with a smooth throttle foot so I never noticed it.  My wife, on the other hand, drives with a continuous throttle-on-throttle-off style so I'd imagine that she would elicit that type of transmission behavior, but she would never notice it because, well, frankly she's mechanically clueless.  Thankfully I drive it 90% of the time so I don't think we'll need to replace the transmission, u-joints, or rear diff anytime soon.","Heck, even with the base model you get power steering, power brakes, power windows, power mirrors, A/C, and a radio.  What more do you need?  We live on an island, so fancy stuff like nav is useless - we already know our way around.  The only option we got was the side curtain airbags, just in case.","I wonder if Nissan could improve the fuel economy?  Maybe a cylinder cutoff feature?  At 3,500 miles we're averaging 18.6 and it continues to improve a little bit, but still, gas ain't getting cheaper - currently it costs us $75 to fill 'er up."

I am impressed by all of the features that come with the model. I did not opt for nav, and am a bit disappointed that bluetooth was not available w/o this feature. Also dissapointed that the iPod (MP3) is a line level (dull hum introduced from speakers), and does not allow for character display on the huge screen. Vehicle performance is outstanding. Gas mileage a bit scary, but I knew what I was getting into. Hoping Bush's replacement will help us out. Like the stereo, but would be more pleased with flexibility to manipulate tones (make sub work harder.)","Comfortable interior, fantastic engine and power. Love the tough stance and throaty roar! Being able to drop the hammer at 65 and get in front of that jackass is thrilling with this size vehicle.

It has lived at the dealer for weeks while they an Nissan diagnosed the problem. The long and short, there is no known cure for these symptoms. 30-45 MPH (5th gear) torque converter clunks with slightest variation in RPM (up and down). Worse yet is that at highway speeds (cruise on) down a hill, it happens over and over again (worse). Now 15000+ miles, can't stand to drive the truck because of the clunking.

Was initally looking for something bigger & w/side airbags standard, but for price, value & fun-to-drive I was back to the Pathfinder. Found an SE w/ side airbags which came loaded minus the leather seats. I've had others including Cherokee and Volvo XC90 - Pathfinder has the best performance(very fast!), character, and lots of storage. Many of the materials on the '08 seem better than '05, the cabin's quieter and the wheels/tires are larger, so it's a slightly different ride. Doesn't seem to corner quite as well, but the '01 handled the best. The thick steering wheel feels just right, and the truck is easy to drive.","Wide opening doors, gobs of storage, & the long list if standard options. The new screen/center stack is far better than the last one and mostly intuitive. I like the soft ride that doesn't compromise too much handling. Feels like this truck will go anywhere.",Quicker steering and flatter cornering. It feels like it should be sportier thanit is. But it is a truck.

Having two T4Rs ('00 + '04) I was wary getting a Nissan but it's been a blast (so far). The V8 is extremely powerful yet is very thirsty (13-14 mpg in mixed driving) and likes premium fuel. Thankfully I have a very short commute. Interior is nicely laid out. Love the premium package features (back-up cam), stereo sounds good, iPod hook-up, automatic 4x4, dual-zone AC, etc. However, heated side mirrors should not be only for the leather pkg. Lame. Handles well but the T4R with X-REAS handled much better in turns. I too have the problems w/ the power seat controls getting touched while exiting the truck.

It is extremely responsive both in acceleration and manueverability. And it is a very comfortable road car.  The only real drawback about this vehicle is that (I didn't do my homework) it requires premium gasoline. Oh, it will run ""ok"" on mid-range - but it's worth pointing out.

This truck contains a V6 4.0L, runs smooth and the cabin noise is relatively quite on the highway.","Power, interior flexibility, styling, off road ability.","Improve the gas mileage, but hey if I was buying a car for gas mileage without any space I would have bought a Prius ;)."
3,Beware of this vehicle,dtbaj ,02/28/2008,,,3,4,3,3,,2,3,3,3,The quality under the hood is not there. Transmission is rough and a/c fan causes a vibration to go through the entire vehicle when sitting still. Nissan blew this one and so did we when we purchased the vehicle. ,Music box and navigation are good. We like that the seats fold down flat.,New transmission
4.125,Not so sure worth 33k,RMallory ,02/23/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,5,4,4,4,"I purchased a 2008 Nissan last October.  While it has a much quieter and smoother ride than my previous SUV (a Trailblazer), I don't think it's worth the price tag I paid - my fault. The 'check engine' light came on THREE weeks after I purchased it - took dealer 2 weeks to order and replace the part. Can't quite get over this issue to enjoy the car just yet.","Pick up on highway, low tire pressure alert.",Wish it was a little wider.  3rd row seats could be a lot more comfortable.
2.625,Worst New Vehicle,MaryAnn B. ,02/22/2008,,,4,4,2,2,,1,3,3,2,I purchase this vehicle and notice a very hard downshifting and bucking when I start to accelerate at about 40 mph. The dealer put in some transmission fluid and told me that would fix the problem. It didn't. I took it back a second time and had the shop manager drive it with me. They kept my vehicle for 1 day and then told me that there was nothing wrong with it. When I told them to give that to me in writing they said that there was something wrong and that they wanted to keep the vehicle longer. They also told me that they have 6 more pathfinders on the lot with the same problem. I am still waiting for it to be fixed. It now downshifts hard at all different speeds.   ,Stereo works good.,Don't sell anymore pathfinders until they fix the problem.
4.5,Mixed feeling,ritchfan ,01/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,3,4,4,"Some good things some not so good about this car.  Not as much room in the driver seat as I had on my 2000 XTerra, which was disappointing for a larger vehicle. Stereo is TERRIBLE- I had a better one that came with my 1980 Datsun station wagon.  Worst thing is you can't really upgrade. If you do you will lose all of the information that goes to the little screen - temp, tire pressure, gas mileage, etc.  Dealer says I cant upgrade to the navigation unit later- that has to be option ordered from factory up front.  But drives nice, is quiet and has more pickup than my 2000 XTerra did.","Backup camera, steering wheel radio controls, extra outlets for cell phones and laptops and such.","Stereo and speakers! More room in drivers seat, better gas mileage (I get 17 mpg in city or highway I get 18, big difference...NOT!)."
4.125,Nice SUV,James B. ,12/29/2007,,,5,5,4,3,,5,4,3,4,"SUV has very nice features and more than enough power. We bought it on a Saturday, drove it during that weekend and noticed the hard downshifting when letting off the gas pedal at approx 40 MPH. Took it back to dealer Monday and service person rode with us. He said that there was a sensor that needed to be replaced. This did not fix our problems. The service dept said there is no fix at this time.  They still do not have a solution.","Nice leather pkg, steering wheel controls and backup camera. Bose stereo rocks!! ","Build a car with a decent transmission or fix it before it goes into the market place.  Air bags are not standard on the SE model so for safety we had to move up into a whole different price range, the LE."
4.375,Great SUV for the money.,Daniel ,12/06/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I have had my Pathfinder for a little more than 2 weeks. Absolutley love it. The engine is a monster, just plain fun to drive! Gas mileage is what's expected. If people are concerned about gas mileage, then stay away from higher displacement engines... nuff said. If people want to complain about the legroom in the third row, upgrade to a bigger car. I have yet to sit in the third row of any midsize SUV and feel comfortable. It just comes with the territory.  I am more than satisfied with my purchase, and hope to have this car for years to come.","The engine! The center console computer, backup camera, storage capacity, overall just very user friendly.","Get rid of the Bose stereos. Very overrated. My buddy gets better sound out of the JBL system in his toyota sequoia. Other than that, very satisfied"
4.625,Great SUV,Jason ,11/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,I am in love with my new Pathfinder.  I was torn between the Murano and the Pathfinder.  The Pathfinder has so much interior room and still has tons of power when you need it.  ,The room inside is by far the best feature.,The third row could use a little more leg room.
4.875,"Initial Gas Mileage, Etc.",ohlode ,10/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The only thing that I was hesitant about prior to purchase was the poor mileage reports for the Pathfinder, both V6 and V8.  My 2008 Pathfinder S 4x4, 4.0L V6 automatic after the first 3 tanks averaged 18.2 mpg in the city.  This is what the in-dash computer was telling me but I didn't believe it until I crunched the numbers after each fillup.  Much better than I expected.  This is in-town driving with maybe 10 to 20% expressway.  I'm fairly light-footed and you can tell a difference if you put your foot into it but I'm not nursing it either. This is a superb SUV for the money.  ",Towing capacity!  Interior well planned.  Third seat standard is a big plus.  Like the easy lift hatchback.  My deal and drive comparison was the 2008 SR5 4Runner which didn't stack up.  Also like this Pathy better than my 2003 Tacoma D cab.,Body side mouldings and standard roof rack crossbars should be standard on the Pathfinder S.  Rails are unusable w/o the crossbars. Nissan accessories should be more reasonably priced.
4.25,Powerful V6 SUV ,linh tran ,10/10/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,4,4,3,4,"This is the most Pathfinder I'm waiting for years with new, exellent interior layout and comfortable functions. Lots of standard features on LE model that are options on another makes. The most thing I wish Nissan to improve on this model is transmission. It has noticeable upshifts and downshifts, changes when I press or release gas pedal just right above 40 mph.This is very annoying if you are driving in town. Other than that this is a good and fun suv to drive.","Seven seats, great and friendly console layout, driver's seating memory, bose sound system is great even at max volume with low distortion, back up camera.","Smoother tranmission, reduce wind noise, reclining back seats and better gas mileage. Would get a new one if all of this improved !"
4.625,Great SUV with affordable price tag,Dan B. ,10/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"After giving the Pathfinder a thorough test drive on a cold, rainy day (hard acceleration, hard braking, cornering, lane changing, U turn etc.) I decided to trade in my Lexus RX 330. Since my other car is a Z, I wanted to still have good performance with 4x4 capabilities. After taking the Pathfinder to the mountains on the weekend Im even happier with my decision. The engine is powerful and responsive. The suspension provides a comfortable ride. The view of the road is excellent. The sound system is great. The cabin is quite and the instrumentation is great. I especially like the navigation system and the link to live traffic. All in all a most excellent vehicle. ","Engine performance, quite ride, excellent sound and navigation system, and very comfortable seats affording great view of the road.",Minor comments since I deem this to be an excellent vehicle: AC fan's low hum is a bit annoying when car is at rest; allow selection of POI while car is in motion. Both are minor since the first will be filtered out as I get used to the car and Im sure the second is driven by lawyers vs. usability.
4,Another Great SUV,billcinva ,09/19/2007,,,5,4,4,4,,4,4,3,4,"This LE replaced my 2005 SE Off Road. I went to all the bells and whistles. The nav, music box, and bluetooth are great! Been fun to drive as always, the LE ride is smoother then my old one. I also like the option of auto 4 wheel or shift on the fly. This is my 2nd pathfinder and I think the quality is there!!",Music box and nav.,Like any vehicle the gas mileage and not having to use super. Try and add a little room the 3rd row.
4.875,First Pathfinder,TEAdams ,09/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"This not only my first Pathfinder, but my first Nissan.  After ten years of driving my old '97 Dodge Dakota it was time for something new.  I'm not big on gadgets, so the S trim was perfect for me.  I was amazed by everything that came standard on the base model.  I had to get the SLT package on my old Dakota for these features.  The V6 actually produces 31 HP more than the 5.2L V8 in my Dakota and I only gave up 12 pound feet of torque.  The Pathfinder is a pleasure to drive and handles great.  It corners better than my old Dakota.  The towing power is a major plus.  6000 Lbs is more than enought to pull my 5X8 trailer with a full load.  I would buy another Pathfinder in a heartbeat.","The dashboard layout is very nice and well thought out.  The center console is nice too.  I really love the adjustable drivers seat.  I hate electric seats, so the manual adjustments are perfect for me.",The door moldings and splash guards should be standard on all trim levels.  I paid to have these installed because you really need that bit of extra protection against car doors and debris from the road surface.  Other than that I can't think of anything.
4.875,2008 Pathfinder SE V6 4X2,momof3 ,09/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought a 2008 Pathfinder SE V6 4x2 on Friday night.  Very easy for me to drive (I'm 5' tall) and my husband has no problems and he's a foot taller.  The adjustable pedals and power driver's seat help with both of us driving this vehicle.  It has tons of seating configurations.  The front passenger seat folds flat if you get the cloth option, but won't fold flat with the leather option.  Good for us because we buy long pieces of PVC and lumber on occasion.  If you have small kids (our youngest is 5), step rails help immensely (and they help me being so short) with getting in and out of the Pathfinder.  Overall, very happy!!","Flip down front passenger seat, tons of tie downs in the back, all the different seating configurations. Audio controls on the steering wheel!!",None so far.
2.375,Steering is dangerously bad,Joefly5 ,09/08/2007,,,1,4,1,1,,4,4,2,2,"Drives great initially, but after about 4k miles, you'll notice a very pronounced vibration in the steering at highway speeds. Sometimes it's so severe you can barely control the car. Lots of others have this problem if you search Google, and there's no resolution at the dealership. Just plain bad engineering on this one. Wish I had known before buying.",Nice power. Nice exterior. Will trade in next year without a doubt for a better-built car.,Steering that doesn't shake and rattle. Unbelievable they put this on the market. Shame on Nissan.
4.25,Great to drive,billc ,09/06/2007,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,3,4,"This is my second Pathfinder, my first was the 05 ""off road"" model. This time I upgraded to the LE with nav. So far it's been nothing but fun to drive.",The nav and sound system is one of the best I've used. The music box feature takes a little to get use too. The build qualitity is there!,"I miss having the easy clean rear area, like my off road model. Make some type of cargo cover that protects the entire back area with the seats down, improve mileage."
4.875,Great SUV - lots of power,William ,09/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Got the V8 4x4. Love the look and power, the V8 is very strong. 3rd row feature is very cool. Just got back from a road trip of 1000 miles and the SUV performed very well. The newly designed on board screen is great too. 18"" look great. Steering wheel radio commands are very useful too. Mileage is actually pretty good for a V8: I get about 19mpg on freeway.  Lots of features for the price.","Love the V8 power, great interior, great on board screen features. ++ for the radio commands on the steering wheel. 6 cd changer 18"" rims on the V8  Affordable 7 passengers V8 SUV.",Better trunk handle.
4.75,I love my Pathfinder,starultra ,08/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,Nissan really had to step up on the design of the interior this year. Nissan has always designed a beautiful car and SUV but when you open the doors you kept thinking what went wrong. This is my 3rd Pathfinder in 3 year. All I can say is that the redesign is great as well as the interior. The performance of the V6 is great! There is a lot of get up and go! ,"The whole SUV, probably the nav, the lay of center console. The seating in the front seat is great. The performance of the Pathfinder is great. I ski and snowboard so I can't wait to take her to Mammoth this year to see how she does!","The woodwork looks like contact paper. I'm having all the woodwork removed and having real woodwork install. Nissan should have included a cup holder area and all the air vents, door handle area as well. The back seat is still the same as 2007, there is little room for anyone to sit. Plus the fuel."
4.25,Transmission Torque Converter Issue,Steve LeVesque ,08/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,1,4,"When you take your foot off the accelerator just above 40 mph, the car downshifts with a noticeable thump. Then when you press the accelerator again, it upshifts with the same noticeable thump. It is so aggravating that I would not have bought the vehicle if I had known. I took it back to the dealer, they tested another 2008 and said that it was ""normal."" I did not have this problem in my 2005 at all. They said it was because they put a dual torque converter in the 2008 model.  Also, it seems to be harder on gas than the 2005. And when I filled up the first time, I noticed a sticker on the inside of the gas cap door that reads ""For best results, use premium gas."" The 2005 did not say this.",The new console. It has a lot of programmable features and a lot of monitoring features like tire pressure. The HVAC system is better. The stereo system is better than the 2005.,Smoother shifting transmission and better gas mileage.
4.125,Tow vehicle,mtngto ,07/24/2007,,,4,4,4,5,,5,4,3,4,"I purchased this V8 vehicle to tow a covered trailer, ~3500 lbs thru mountains.  Initial trip saw 14 MPG overall, with excellent power (acceleration and cruising), braking, and stability.  Very comfortable (front seats).  Very manueverable (vs Armada).  Negatives:  cramped rear seating, noisy cooling fan, rear squat (no air suspension option as on Armada). Also, folding middle center seat interferes with opening center console, also conceals rear air controls. However, overall very pleased, and exceeded my expectations. ","V8, 4x4, auto transmission, backup camera, dual zone climate controls.","Quiet cooling fan, rear air suspension, rear air deflector, redesign center middle folding seat, reposition rear air controls, reclining rear seats (2nd and 3rd rows)."
4.875,Great SUV For The Money,simon ,07/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I was looking at the Lexus RX 350 for months along with other SUVs but I finally decided to get the 2008 SE Pathfinder. After looking at options and the price of the 08 Pathfinder I figured I could not go wrong with this purchase. There is a big difference between the 08 to the 07 so don't be fooled. I got the SE loaded out with the leather package and premium sound. I also got tint thrown in and went with the extended warranty with tire replacement. I have had it for about a week and love the car and the ride. If you get an SE model, make sure you get a cargo mat, the rubber tends to scratch up easily. ","All the included options. The Bose sounds great, homelink is a must, and the 3rd row seating is not too bad for adults. Also the adjustable pedals and the back up camera are great features. ","Make the back cargo area so it doesn't scratch up so easily. It could get better gas mileage but who can complain, the V6 can tow 6000 pounds, who can beat that. The gauges could be a bit nicer, maybe like the white Maxima SE gauges. "
4.875,"Pathfinder LE ""08""",AJ ,07/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Fantastic machine, a computer on wheels; the navigation is all one could ask for and works better than most I've seen. The driver interface with the car works well (voice interface) and is state of the art. Drove the Highlander, Envoy Denali, Saturn Outlook, and decided on Nissan for both looks and ride. So far mileage has been better than manufacturer specs.",Navigation and music box.,
4.875,"Excellent truck, now with great gadgets",Marc ,06/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded up from a 2005 Pathfinder, which I was always impressed with.  I wanted the new features (Bluetooth, Intelligent Key, backup camera, Music Box, better navigation with touch screen, voice commands and traffic) added in the 2008 model.  The powerful V6 has always been my favorite feature, and my last Pathfinder proved very reliable and versatile.  The gadgets are great, but I'm disappointed that MP3s can't be loaded into the Music Box.  Otherwise, I find the Pathfinder to be perfect vehicle.","Powerful V6, fold-flat 3rd row and excellent sound system.","Cheap looking gauges, Music Box should load MP3s.  "
