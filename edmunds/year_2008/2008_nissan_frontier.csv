Best looking small/mid-sized truck.
Power generated from the best V6 in its class is second-to-none.
Drive a Tacoma, then drive a Frontier, and you will definitely notice the difference in power.
Interior is spacious, and have put my parents in the back seats without any complaints from them!
The chromed bumpers look great.
Tires and rims on the SE V6 model are a good size and look good.
My girlfriend drives a BMW, which I love, and I still look forward to driving my Frontier.","Would be nice if air/heat controls offered more options, and were available for rear passengers.
Would love if fog lamps came standard, at least in all V6 models - I am going to have them installed.
With the lack of fog lamps, the plastic covers in their place look a little cheesy.

Shifting is exceptionally smooth and power from the V-6 is plentiful.  Excellent handling on mountainous terrain and in winter weather.

I reconmend everyone doing that to their truck.  Now we did go on a road trip and got 20 mpg but that city mileage hurts. The interior is plasticy but no biggie......I mean it is a truck.

Engine and transmission are super smooth and I like the gentle rumble of the engine when it starts.  All controls (AC/radio) are easy to reach and I like the big knobs and well illuminated dash for night driving.  Nissan has pulled away from Toyota and made a better truck.

Standard features plus what you get with the SE V6 Value Pkg blew the others away.  Absolute best value out there.  The ride is very smooth and quiet, transmission shifts are almost unnoticeable, more power than expected, handles great.  Fit and finish is awesome.  Especially surprised at how little, if any wind noise at highway speeds.  Plenty of interior room.  Interior is rather plain but very functional.

Performance is incredible, handling is superb for a 4wd truck and the ride is very comfortable, but it is still a truck with a light back end. Mileage is on par with the EPA average.  The light output from the headlights is not the best, highly recommend getting the foglights as they help a great deal.  Only issue thus far is a cracked windshield washer nozzle which is being replaced under warranty in a few days. I was torn between the Frontier, Ranger, and Tacoma.

It is not a perfect truck, but it is better than most.  I has more power than a Tacoma, but not as much back seat room (in a crew cab).

I quickly decided that the Tacoma was out of my price range, so that left the Dakota and the Frontier. When you put these two trucks side by side there is no comparison the Frontier wins by a knockout. It's bigger, more powerful and comes with way more features for a smaller price tag.  I love this truck, it's is fun to drive, looks great with the chrome grill and bumpers unlike the cheap grey plastic bumpers of similarly priced Dakotas.

Always wanted a Tacoma, until I drove the Frontier. More options for $2000 less than the Tacoma, more interior room, bigger engine, 4-wheel discs, and traction control.  The engine revs like my dad's G35, I had to get out and check under the hood to make sure it wasn't the same engine.  Nope, just the same technology.  The truck also rides much sportier than the Tacoma, again, makes me feel like I am driving that Infiniti again.  I am getting between 17-18 MPG around town going from work and back, but I also don't hammer on it.  ","High revving, Infiniti sounding engine.  SE value package a must! 4-wheel discs, durable seats, legroom! The big chrome grill with my shiny black paint.","The stock stereo sounded like a transistor radio.

I had planned on getting a Toyota Tacoma forever, and came very close, but before purchasing I decided to shop around alittle, and I am glad that I did. Once I took the Frontier off the parking lot for a test drive, I knew it was a done deal. The smoothness of the ride and powertrain blew the Tacoma away, not to mention a larger truck for less money (especially the dump)and more POWER. The dealership was very friendly and threw in a few extra accessories (unlike Toyota). It was a no brainer. It's a truck that handles like a car or SUV, I love it.","I love everything about my truck from the price, look, ride and power. There is plenty of room in the back seat.

It was either the Tacoma or the Frontier that I narrowed it to.  The exterior of the truck is gorgeous. The interior has a lot of hard plastics but are assembled nicely.  I am amazed how smooth the powertrain is in this truck. It provides plenty of power for passing on the freeway. The optional stereo sounds very nice. The audio controls on the steering wheel are handy as is the bluetooth. Seat comfort is very good in the front seats and acceptable in the rear.

So far both are met in this vehicle. At present I have 10,000 miles (5 months) so have had a chance to knock it about a bit.  The ride is a bit harsh, but not unexpected. Interior is a bit plain, though functional. I have developed one small buzz in the dash in this point. No other issues to date with build/function. The sound quality of the radio does improve over time.  Wish it had an ipod jack standard.  Despite the many miles there are so far no chips nor blemishes in the paint.  Seats need less front cushion or more rear cushion.  Overall: Good truck","Reliability/build both seem up to challenge.

I had no intention of purchasing a four banger, but after giving both the Tacoma and Frontier 4 cyls a shot, I wasn't let down at all.

I couldn't bring myself to go with the 14 - 19 mpg. This is my primary commuter, and I just couldn't justify it.  That having been said, this truck at least makes you feel like you chose the 4 X 4, with its high riding position, decidedly big-truck suspension and aggresive styling.  If you can bring yourself to own up to it, you'll find the four cyl engine is plenty tough enough for weekend chores, hauling a popup and merging onto the highway.

The turning circle is a bit too big for the size of the vehicle.  I like the covered/weather tight hitch connection.  Two glove boxes are nice, but one could be cooled.
