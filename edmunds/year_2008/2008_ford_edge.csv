4,Good family starter,Chad Price ,10/25/2016,3,4,4,,,3,4,4,4,,,"A good vehicle for it's value. Nothing in it is really going to blow you away with class or ""piz-az"", but it performs as advertised. The 3.5L V6 has enough guts to help you get around slow moving vehicles quickly, but again, won't amaze with speed. It averaged about 21 mpg for us, a little under what we thought it would, but not bad at all. The leg room is good up front in my opinion (but I like to sit up close for a 6'2"" male), however the rear is a little cramped for bigger adults, but fine for averaged sized people and kids. I always felt cargo space was a little small but we always had to fit a big dog into the vehicle plus our cargo. (But that's our problem and has nothing against the vehicle.) We had a few electrical issues with the BCM (Body Control Module) that was about $600 fix, at about 75,000 miles, but other than that everything worked great. If your just starting off and have a growing family, this is a great car for you!",,

Does great in northern Wisconsin winters. I drive about 60% hwy and average just over 21 mpg with aggressive driving, so gas mileage isn't great but worth it with the quality of the vehicle.

I also change the oil every 6000 miles with full synthetic mobil 1. the oil still looks good after 6000 miles! the front end seems to be riding hard as of late but it may need some gas struts replaced, most of my miles are city driving and joy riding UPDATE -  had to replace both tie links in the front as they were worn and thats where the clanking was coming from. Had to replace the gas tank on recall and the now the airbag was recalled as part of Takata.  The right rear wheel bearings went on me over the summer but that was fixed also.

The interior shines IMHO with a conservative, well designed layout using durable materials and easy, intuitive controls. The leather seating is nice with contrast stitching! The backseat felt the most comfortable and roomy of the 4. The sync system is outstanding, with nothing comaprable in any other vehicle we looked at; bluetooth+Cell=sweet. Little extras like puddle lamps and power rear liftgate are nice too.

I did not know that the radio would not work, the tire would blow out, and then the transmission would go out all in less than a week.

The overall shape is very pleasing.The height was also a factor for me because I have trouble getting in and out of vehicles that are too low. . The interior  suits my needs perfectly. I find everything is close at hand and easy to read. The seats are totally comfortable, there's plenty of head and foot room. Storage and cargo space is great too.The music system (6 CD changer, AM/FM radio and MP3 option  are very adequate and easy to use. I have yet to look for an option and find that it's missing.The drive-ability is fabulous. Very smooth and easy to park and maneuver.The AWD was a life saver this winter too!",The overall outside look never fails to impress me.

The first time we drove it, it was noisey and rode real rough (SEL Model) compared to the other vehicles we were shopping.  After we returned a second time and drove a Limited with the 20"" wheels we changed our mind.  Very nice ride and quiet.  Sync audio system is awesome as is the Vista Roof.  Getting 20-21mpg around town.  Not too bad, but better than the estimate given on the sticker.  Origionally had some issues with rattles and creeks but were promptly fixed by the selling dealer.  ",Sync and Roof,Ford should stop running ads on how easy the voice activation system is to use.  It is NOT as fast and easy as the commerical portrays.

It was between this or the Honda CRV and once I drove the Edge the contest was over. I love how much space I have in the Edge. The center console is big enough for me to put my purse in when I don't want to drag it into a store. There are cup holders everywhere. Love the way it looks sporty compared to some other CUV/SUVs. I feel very safe in this car. It's definitely bigger than my Civic but not too big to feel like I'm driving a tank. Overall, I love this car.","Back up sensor comes in handy when in the parking garage at work.  I love the dark blue, I've gotten quite a few compliments on the color.  I love the MP3 player outlet even though the sound quality could be better. ",Steering wheel volume controls should be standard on all models.  Wish the rear window on the hatch opened.  For those who can't afford the panoramic vista roof a regular sun/moon roof should be an option without having to add it later.

I have been a continuous Ford owner since I was a teenager and I own a number of Fords including a 1964 T-Bird, 1995 Lincoln Mark 8, 2002 Lincoln LS V8, 2002 T-Bird and now the Edge AWD LTD. This vehicle is comfortable, quiet, solid and well equipped. The exterior and interior styling is beautiful with the leather interior and it rides like my Lincolns.","The Vista Roof adds so much natural light, the BlueTooth/Sync for hands free phone, Sirus radio and the big 20 inch chrome wheels with the AWD make it great in our deep snow up here.  ",Better gas mileage but I am still on break-in but feel a 6 speed should get better mileage and perhaps in the warmer weather and more highway driving I feel it will improve. Braking is not great but it is a big vehicle so adjusting my driving habits will solve that; we all drive too close anyway.
4.125,Outside mirrors,edgeowner ,01/02/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,4,3,4,4,"I am 5'2"" and have problems seeing over or around the outside mirrors. It seems as though they are too large for the vehicle.  They create a horrible blind spot, which makes me very nervous while driving. I have tried raising the seat, but then it's difficult to reach the pedals and I crack my knee on the steering column when I get in and out of the vehicle.  I ask my boyfriend to drive the car to get his feedback.  He is 5'9"" and agreed he thought they were larger than normal.  He drives a F-150 truck.

I hated everything about the thing. I told myself over and over again I would never purchase another American-made vehicle again, I thought it was such a mistake. Then I came upon the Edge. It is unlike any Ford I have ever known.  It is gorgeous inside, love the two tone! It's so fun to drive and handles so well! I feel really safe in it. I love the leather, it's not that cheap plasticy leather, and I love the stitching. Super roomy. I was really shocked at the price - very affordable.

Wow, I am impressed with the ease of maneuverability, the sound system, the sun roofs, and the seat's base-length- finally a seat that extends out far enough and doesn't cut off the circulation in one's legs. The second row seating is also unusually comfortable for this type car. Only had it a week, but so far, it's outstanding.","The comfortable seats, the sound system. I'm sure I'll like the voice command too as soon as I learn how to use it.","It could be improved by slightly better gas mileage, but its the same mpg as the Toyota minivan."

I am so glad we did. We decided on the Limited model with the Sync/Sirius/6 cd and the leather interior. I really like the two tone interior and the contrast stitching on the seats. We are just back from an 1800 mile trip and the Edge performed wonderfully. Very comfortable on the long ride and plenty of room. Gas mileage was not great, but driving 80+ MPH will do that.

I have had my Edge for only three weeks and have over 3,000 miles on it. I drove it from Michigan to Maine on vacation. The Edge handled flawlessly. It was very comfortable and except for a little wind noise at 45-50 mph from the outside mirrors is was like driving a luxury car. The looks, vista roof, audio system and overall driving experience still make me smile. There were no issues of quality at delivery. There are none now. I hope this is an omen of things to come. It looks great,it handles well, is very comfortable. As long as I stay around 70 on the road I get about 24.6 miles to the gallon. Good Job Ford.

Am enjoying  everything about this car except the braking distance.  I live in a deer prone area and have had four accidents due to them over the years. I really need great brakes! The Edge must improve in this category.  Can't believe for the level of this automobile that Ford didn't have a higher standard when it came to such an important feature.

From the amenities and comfort of the interior to the way it handles and performs on both city streets and open highways, this is one impressive vehicle! Acceleration and maneuverability beats Saturn, Chevrolet, Toyota and Honda in comparable class vehicles and at a great price. We purchased the base model SE, but all the extras like MicroSoft Sync, top of the line sound system with a 6 CD changer, radio and cruise control in the steering wheel, roof rack, anti-theft system, etc. this vehicle is in a class of its own. The ride is extremely comfortable; cruising at 70 mph feels like you're going 30 or 35 and bumps are almost unnoticeable.","We really like the MicroSoft Sync, radio and cruise controls in the steering wheel, and comfortable yet responsive feel of the suspension system. The passenger compartment is quiet, even at highway speeds, and conversation can be had at normal speaking volume. Lots of leg and hip room in all seats.","If Ford could figure out a way to improve mpg for the Edge by 25% or more while maintaining performance, that would make a great vehicle outstanding!

When we left it had 2,881 miles on it. At first I did not care for the gas mileage at all, but the dealership kept telling me the mileage would get better and boy did it! I always use the cruise control, and at 74 mph this new Edge averaged 33 mpg and I have 4 people who can verify this. So eat your heart out Toyota owners.

The few snow days were absolutely no challenge, the SYNC system is amazing.  Leather and other interior features are very luxurious and are extremely comfortable even for a full day in the car. Fuel economy is what I expect for a strong V6. I have never driven a car that turns heads like this! A trip up to the ski hill with two friends and skis and snowboards was a perfect use of all the space and comfort and we passed many vehicles on the way up in the snow. Passing on the highway is a breeze..the power seems even more evident at full highway speed, it can snap your head back at 120kph","SYNC, power lift gate, navigation, sound system, leather seats with bold stitching, very comfortable back seats and of course the full glass roof! Awesome to have open on a sunny day and the wind blocker when it is open reduces highway noise to almost imperceptible.

The drive is nice and smooth ,and I do enjoy the Sync, nav system and power lift-gate. The airconditioning needs some help. Even on high, I keep reaching to turn it higher, and the airvents will not turn to blow directly in your face. Opening the sun-roof helps, but it is loud at higher speeds. You would think will all the hype over Sync, Ford would have invested in more speakers. 4 speakers standard and upgraded sound has only 6?  Our Corolla has better sound! After 4 fillups, we are averaging 16mpg mostly city driving.","Power liftgate, SYNC and Bluetooth.","Beef up the AC,add more airvents or allow vents to turn more inward.

I have a 45 minute drive to work (one way) and am hurting by the time I get there. The seats are uncomfortable,makes my back hurt & makes my legs go to sleep and hurt. The seat needs to tilt more at the base for the shorter person. This car is  not built for the short person. I can't drive through the ATM without a lot of problems or need to get out. The AC vents are pathetic. At certain angles the sun shines on the chrome strip on the shifter and surround and shines in the eyes. Would rather not have the chrome. Road noise on this one, I believe due to the brand of tires. ","Bluetooth feature, radio okay, height of the SUV, love the copper color.","Have a MP3 jack on the dash, bottom of seat needs to tilt forward for shorter drivers. Side mirrors too high, major blind spots. Put Michelins on all instead of no name brand (makes road noise fairly loud), better air vents, arm rests- seating is too wide and seat up to for me to use the door/console."

The car averaged 25 mpg there and back, thought that was fantastic. Since we got back and just travel around town, the mileage has averaged between 17.5mpg and 18.5mpg. That's still pretty good to me considering it's an SUV and we both have a pretty heavy foot. The engine isn't the quickest from a dead stop but it does pretty good, however when you're up to speed  it really gets up and goes when you want to pass slower drivers. My wife and I both love the car more every time we drive it. To think I was worried about buying a Ford product seems a little silly now.","The power lift gate is a must have feature on this vehicle, the driving position is great, more like a truck than a car, the leather on the seats seems to be high quality,my wife loves the heated seats, I like the sync for the iPOD","The bluetooth is not that great, hard to hear and be heard, however it works great as a caller id on the radio, that way you can screen calls without picking up your phone"

The Edge has a nice firm grip on the road and is quick enough to get you into traffic without any anxiety. The ride is quiet and I have too many choices for music with the Sync system. All in all, I love the car. I love the automatic lift on the rear door and the roominess for all the passengers. So far the gas mileage has been in the 17-23 mpg range.

A great riding and handling vehicle with a well- engineer interior space to seat its riders. My wife was immediately drawn to the luxurious look and feel of the stone colored leather and the pearlescet white sand mica paint. The 20"" tires with their chrome clad wheels gives the Edge a final touch of sophistication and well-connectedness. Engine is quiet and responsive with all the power you need. No jerkiness, no hesitation, and one of the smoothest transmissions we've ever experienced.  Beats our Lexus RX330 all over the place.  The panoramic moonroof-a real wowzer! ","Sync Power lift back doo.r Back up sensors. Comfy leather seating. Soothing feel of luxury without breaking the bank.  So impressed we're going to get a second one for me.

I decided on the Edge because it met all the requirements of what I wanted in my next vehicle. I average 25 - 30,000 miles a year, so relibility, comfort, interior room and gas mileage were all important factors. I have driven it 4,400 miles now and have been averaging 19.9 miles/gallon overall. Congrats to Ford!

The seats feel like they are constantly hugging you and the placement of the controls are spot on. I bought my Egde right after the test drive. A nice quiet ride. Wind noise is a thing of my past. I did a MPG test at 65mph I got 22.3mpg at 60 I got 25.3mpg and at 55mph I got 27.3mpg. I know 55 feels slow but its a 25% savings and I don't have to worry about passing anyone. Plus who wants to get to work in a hurry. It has plenty of get up and go when you need it and its very agile but stable. I dont miss my 13mpg avg F150 super crew Lariat one bit.,"Sync and USB for my i-pod, power lift gate, reclining rear seats, auto rear push button folding seats, dual climate controls. I love it all",Seems I'm always spraying the rear window when I turn the wiper on for a quick swipe so maybe a different way to do that.  Exterior temp reading. Bigger sun visor mirrors
3.125,Loyal to Ford but Crossed Over,Dennis Orzo ,06/08/2008,,,4,4,3,4,,2,4,2,2,I'm sorry I crossed over from a Mountaineer. The Edge can't compare and suffers from numerous areas of poor engineering. Fuel injectors and exhaust make great deal of noise. Can't drive with windows open above 30 MPH. Extreme wind noise from vista roof diffuser. Constantly hunting for lower gears at highway speed an hangs on upshift. Breaking and gas mileage are both poor. Water builds up under tail light lenses and fills the area behind the high break light. Could also benefit by having some tie downs in cargo area. AC vents don't direct air high enough to clear heat from the ceiling. Suggest you test drive at highway speeds before purchase. ,Good looking. Microsoft Sync is a nice feature.  ,Re-tune exhaust so car doesn't sound like a four cylinder. Quiet fuel injectors. Change gearing or fix transmission controls. Change air diffuser on roof. Fix AC vents.  
5,Ford Finally Has A Winner!,Dennis/Linda ,05/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I traded a 2006 Toyota Camry XLE for a 2008 Ford Edge Limited. We were afraid to commit to American, because their track record was not the greatest. We decided to check out the Ford Edge since we were in the market for a new CUV. We looked at all the competition, and we decided to buy the Edge. We have to take our hats off to Ford. We believe Ford finally has a winner with this Edge. This car is absolutely amazing! Excellent feature set, great design, fantastic build quality, what more can you ask for. Compared to the competition, we believe they truly have an ""edge."" I'm happy to support the American economy, now that Ford has a solid product.","SYNC-great! Side-view mirror puddle lamps. Very comfortable leather seats - great support.

What a solid vehicle!","Performance, appearance, comfort, quietness.",None I can think of at this time.

I do still have a 18' bass boat, that I would not be able to get to the lake with out something with enough power. The Edge has plenty of that! The quality of this car is tight.

I only have 1500 miles on it so far.","SYNC is cool and easy to use. Drives more like a 350z than a truck. The kids like the reclineing second row. I think its the right size. Great lights, can easily see at night.","I am always kicking the lower moulding on the door on exit. Ford should come out with a hybrid model for those who will not need to tow, but do not make one with a third row. It would be horrile looking. Like the hearse like extended TrailBlazers.

5,I love living on the edge,cHocOhOLicC ,05/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My husband and I bought the Edge after my '98 Ford Explorer. We needed a larger car, for we have long trips planned for this summer, but we had to consider the kids. They needed room! We got all options but instead of the vista roof, we ended up getting the entertainment system (dvd player). We love the roominess and space. The look seems sleek and nicer than other vehicles, a plus. We compared it to the Escape, and chose the Edge. The Escape rode higher and was thinner while the Edge rode lower and is wider, therefore the Edge had more room. Overall we are in love.","Roominess, nice sleek black exterior coat, love the camel leather, comfortable",Maybe third row seating could be a future option?
5,Ford got it right!,Lee Waters ,05/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I recently traded my gas powered F-250 in for my new Edge. I'm gonna say this is a cool ride. When total strangers come up to you, and often I might add, and ask if you like it...well that says a lot. Of course I tell them that I love it, then proceed to show them all the cool features. Then when they sit in it, you aught to see the smile on there faces. I love it. For me this is a really nice cuv. It's put together well, rides smooth, it catches the eye with it's 20"" wheels, and with the DVD player, satellite radio, and Bluetooth capabilities long trips are fun again! I think any one looking for a new cuv should give the Ford Edge a look.","I love the SYNC powered by Microsoft.

4,"Improved Ford, still asking for more",driver@FL ,05/11/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,3,4,"I traded a 05 Freestyle for the 08 Edge. I test drove 09 Murano, Mazda CX-7, Acura RDX. Decided for the Edge because of the lower lease payments (+ X-plan), vista roof, and some other features. Exterior design also a plus. However I have to admit the 09 Murano drives much better and has a better finishing, unfortunately too expensive and premium fuel. The Edge engine and 6 speed auto-trans. is a huge leap from my old engine with the CVT. I read some reviews saying not refined, slow, etc.. for the Edge/MKX. Maybe not the best ever but I am very happy and suprised with its performance.","Vista roof, Audiophile sound, Sync is nice but annoying some times, power everything, memory seats (however doesn't adjust seatback which is manual), nice ride.","Tons to improve. No leather on the door panels or center console arm rest (what kind of savings are those?), radio display is from last decade and adapted to text, radio commands (almost 200 satellite radio and you can't dial the channel number directly or ask sync to go to channel #)."

Also this has plenty of room in the trunk and it does fit three people in the back comfortably.",We got a basic model (which is perfect for us) and the headlights are manual.  I haven't turned on headlights on a car in 10 years because most are automatic today. This is not a big concern at all.

So far I like this vehicle better than any vehicle I have owned. I bought an 02 4 runner and the Edge beats it. I love everything about it. I own an 08 Edge Limited. My Edge has all the extras except the navagiation. Joe Sartaion Ford didn't have one on their lot with navagation or I would have purchased it. I could do without the Vista roof, because I very seldom open my sun roof. The Vista roof is different and very nice.","Sync voice activated sys, 6 way pwr/htd/mem front seats,dual temperature control,fold flat passenger seats,power liftgate,and rear detection if I get too close to something.",Interior is nice but it could be upgraded.

4.5,Fine car,PIerre ,04/25/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,I couldn't be happier with my Edge. Great visibility and looks.  The 20 inch wheels look great too. What a pleasure to finally drive American.,The SYNC is nice but the power lift gate and rear seats really sold me. Watched a woman struggle to close the rear of her Lexus SUV and I chuckled to myself.,Perhaps a larger rear window and a little better mileage but overall this is one fine vehicle.
5,My New Edge,TamzLynn ,04/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I absolutely loved driving my big Ford Expedition, but because of gas prices and $100 fill-ups, my husband & I decided to buy something smaller. I was very worried about feeling comfortable in a ""smaller"" vehicle b/c I'm 5'10"" and having enough leg & head room was a big problem in most of the vehicles that I test-drove. The Edge is a great CUV. It has a lot of pep and it handles really well. In the Edge feel like I have more leg room in the backseat that I did in my Expedition.  We took it on our first road trip and we were able to fit luggage for 4 people and still had room to spare. I can't say enough good things about the SYNC system...LOVE IT","SYNC, great sounding speakers, handling","The head rests are not too comfortable for us tall people, I need to have them all the way up.

Another nice car but it seemed a bit boring and under powered. Car three was the Buick crossover. Another nice car but it just didn't move the soul.

4.625,Ford on Edge of Success,ikebhm ,10/27/2007,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is great. Pleasantly surprised after reading middling reviews from Consumer Reports and other car rags. The 3.5 engine is strong and economical, vista roof is a delight and the Sync system sold the deal.  Sync is easy to use and set up and has USB to connect ipod for charging and full integration.  Voice commands actually work.  Heard about poor braking but have not found this is an issue, in everyday driving it goes and stops effortlessly.  Getting about 25 mpg highway and 19 in town.","Sync, vista roof, 3.5 engine, exterior style","Better interior plastics on dash and doors, auto open/close on all windows, more aggressive exhaust note, get a new ad agency"
