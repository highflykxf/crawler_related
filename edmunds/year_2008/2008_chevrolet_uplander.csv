Capt.  chairs don't fold and flip for access to rear row seat.( Bucket seats do) Don't know why the difference.
3.75,Quality by GM?,anthony ,04/08/2008,,,3,5,1,3,,5,4,4,5,"2 day old van and defrost blower stopped working. Coldest night of the year too. The dealer took care of the issue giving me a rental. The passenger door and fender don't fit at all at the windshield, big gap on one side no gap on the other. The dealer isnt sure if it can be fixed. A terrible visual disaster. It is however not limited to my van only as I have seen many Uplanders the same. Also a rough idle sometimes with a gentle surge when I have a foot on the brake.",Better on gas than I thought. Styling is nice and the price was great,"Fix the fit and finish, its not acceptable anymore to have anything less than perfect."
2.875,Tragedy ,brox08 ,03/30/2008,,,1,5,4,2,,3,5,2,1,This is the worst vehicle on the roads. The van features poor and ill handling. OnStar is the best feature. I am now trading it  in for a New Sienna. Never drive this again,"OnStar, leather seats",Everything except OnStar and leather seats
