4,Very good truck,George Dibble ,06/23/2016,4,,4,,,5,4,5,4,,,Very good truck. I've had this little ranger a little over two years and I've had no problems with it whatsoever. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a small pick up. The only downside is that it's towing capacity is  Limited by it's four-cylinder engine.,,
5,Easy to work on,Jason ,12/27/2015,5,1,4,,,5,5,3,3,,,"My second ranger, bought first one new in 99 and drove it 14 years. This one is AUTO with CC. It was wrecked, but I've had no issues.  The 2.3L is pretty pathetic, but I get 25+ mpg.  The parts are cheap and it's easy to work on, simple is good. I bought it with 45K in 2010 and put 50K on it. The only thing that broke was the heater/AC fan clicks if not adjusted right after riding on a bumpy road. I've changed front rotors, breaks and bearings, all the shocks and struts, the rear diff fluid, AT fuild and filter, plugs and wires, and flushed radiator. I did cause a steering pump leak by putting radiator flush in it, but they're only 60 bucks. It is  VERY easy to work on, I am not a mechanic. I've towed/loaded heavy stuff and ripped up stumps. She will run. It's really small on the inside. Rangers are awesome and reliable.",,
3,After the new car glow,JR ,05/06/2010,,,3,4,2,4,,4,1,3,3,"  Wonderful to drive when the weather turns ugly, only thing that gives me trouble is sheer ice, with factory tires.   With no load it rides rough, with @150 - 250 lbs of cargo it is a much improved ride.   At a hair over 6' I have room to move the seat back to give myself more leg to peddle room, but I do not need it.  Everything else is too cramped.  If I have a passenger we are riding shoulder to shoulder.    As a short commuter or weekend play vehicle it is wonderful.   SADLY, as a full time ride for me, @350KM/220Mi/week, it is not a good choice.   I choose to support Ford.  I should have bought a Toyota to get the same qualities but with better comforts at a higher cost.","200+ HP gives a lot of pep, especially with a 5 SPD manual. BRIGHT lights, with no apparent dead zone.","  Give the Ranger an F series profile, not a bricks.   Increase cabin width @30CM, height @10CM, rear seat area by @30CM with front facing seats.   FLEX fuel, remote start, etc as available options, same as the F series.   Ranger owners want/need a little smaller vehicle, not one with no options."
4.75,Who needs luxory,Dr. Witt ,04/09/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,I love all these people that complain about how the ranger is simple and outdated.  Technology means nothing when your vehicle is in the shop because the state of the art traction control system has a computer malfunction.  This truck is always reliable because of its simplicity which is reflected in the low price. You can easily spend more money for a Toyota Tacoma but at the end of the day the ranger is more reliable and will get you from a to b for less money.  They are also very easy to do self repairs on which also saves money.  If you want luxury buy a lexus they cost just about the same as one of those loaded cushy f150s  ,"manual locks, manual windows, manual transmission (just more things that wont break in the future), old school heating and ac controls, sport wheel wells",This is the only truck that still actually feels like a truck if it ain't broke don't fix it.

It's 2wd but it will make it through deep mud, just don't stop. I've got a K&N filer and a Flowmaster exhaust installed which added very usable low/mid range power.

4.625,Ranger Birthday,Thomas Kenny ,04/15/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,3,5,5,5,"Bought myself a new 08 Ranger for my birthday. It is the XL Supercab with the 2.3l I4 engine with 5 speed automatic overdrive transmission. I love the torch red color, and I did get A/C, tilt/cruise, stereo with CD player that is MP3 friendly, buddy seats, privacy glass and sliding rear window. I am looking for some good gas mileage and am told that I can get between 24 and 29 mpg on the road after the engine loosens up in 2-3 thousand miles. I love to drive it, it is very quiet, handles predictably with good road feel and steering. This is probably the last year of the Ranger so this truck should keep the Ranger memory alive for many years.   ",I like the body style and the size of the truck for my needs.,Easier access to rear of supercab. There has to be a better way!
4.625,Good Buy!,3ABirdMan ,03/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"I traded in a '03 F150 FX4 SuperCrew Lariat (14.4 MPG). I didn't need 4 doors anymore, and needed better fuel economy. I looked at the Chevy/GMC and Toyota before deciding on the Ranger. I am very satisfied. At 6'3"" & 255 lbs, I couldn't fit in the Chevy/GM due to lack of leg/knee room (I have no problem in the Ranger because of dash and console design!) and the Tacoma was too much money.  I love the ""feel"" of the seat - it is firm and comfortable, with a good ride. The 2.3L 4-cyl engine is great for economy, but lacks power IF you have to haul alot of cargo or pull a small trailer with the A/C on!  Empty, acceleration and power are fine. I really like the Ranger, despite the small size!","Gas mileage. Avg 23 MPG on about 60% highway driving through 6000 miles. A/C will erode that a little this summer, though. Comfort of seats is better than power and leather of old Lariat on highway trips! Handling is exceptional, except for the ol' Ranger rear end hop on bad bumps!",Radio with RDS. Map lights or lighted vanity mirrors! Tinted windows / privacy glass. Offer 4-door Supercab with 2.3L 4 cyl! I have trouble accessing Super Cab area because of my size and lack of room!  Don't offer jump seats if that's what it takes!
4.875,08 New Ranger,           bill ,02/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought a 08 XLT supercab 4x4, with all of the goodies in and out. It is nice in regards to the ride (have owned othere 4x4s, beats all. Gas mileage is ok, stereo is great. 4x4 smooth. Just an all around nice ride.","Limited slip gears, 4.0, easy to reach interior, cup holders, exceptional stereo,",
4.5,Best small truck on the road,Richard ,02/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,3,5,"I decided on a small truck for ease of parking and economy. To me the Ranger provided the best value by far and the ride was as good as any of the other small trucks. The fit and finish on the new 2008 was equal to and better then the others. I think it is the best looking small truck on the road, and my friends agree. The only downside is the 3.0 motor is not up to competers v6's and the gas mileage is below par  ","Looks, fit and finish, nice interior design and looks. Comfortable ride.","Compass, on board computer gas monitoring, ambient temp. and trip readouts. Gas mileage with the V6"
2.75,Transmission woes & more,Disappointed ,02/19/2008,,,5,5,1,1,,2,4,2,2,"Since delivery the transmission has not functioned properly.  It's been to the dealer 4 times in 3500 miles.  Upon delivery shift from ""R"" to ""D"" and it might take 3 seconds to engage.  When it did finally engage it slammed so hard that I thought something might break. Same would happen at a stop light. Dealer's made progress. The big bang's gone, but it still disengages when decelerating at slow speeds so then when you accelerate it bumps back into gear. Rear passenger supercab door is bent and that's why it doesn't close properly.  It's again back to the dealer to see if they can fix the tranny and the door. This is my 7th Ford vehicle and the first with any problems. Yuck!",Interior design. The seats are firm but comfortable. The ride is as expected.,Better gas mileage. More torque. A transmission that works.
5,E-Z on the wallet,Jim ,02/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just got it, sold my gas hog Dodge Ram 2500. Tired of putting 100$ in gas, so bought the little Ranger where can you spend under 12,000 on a new truck and still have fun in a 2008 model. Keep up the good work Ford...if it ain't broke don't fix it.",Passing up gas stations!,None yet!
4.875,Second one in four years,Dave ,01/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded in a 2004 Tremor 2 door Supercab for this 2008 Sport 4 door Supercab because getting to the storage behind the seats was such a pain.  The 4 door is the way to go!  I also wanted the 4.0 V6 engine this time.  The 3.0 in the older truck just didn't have any guts for passing on the highway.  The reliability is great, not one trip to the dealer in 60,000 miles w/the first one.","Outside mirrors are larger on the 2008 model which helps eliminate blind spots.  The 6 c.d. and Sirius radio option is a must also.  I'm sorry to read that this may be the last year for the Ranger.  That's why I got a new one, just in case Ford stops making them.","A compass and outside temperature option would be nice.  Also a overhead console for sunglasses, etc.  Other that that it's a great vehicle."
4.25,I've owned three in 15 years.,john ,01/07/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,3,5,"The 4.0 V6 is impressive. Lots of power but they could have improved the fuel economy. I'd rate the pickup of this truck equal to any small V8. I get about 20 mpg highway. I expect a slight increase when the truck bed cover is installed and I do something about the air intake system ( K&N). This pickup replaced a 05 f150, Interior room took a little getting used to but still its not bad. Mine is the Sport version with a 5 speed. It pulls my 18 foot boat without even struggling.","Nice 6 disc stereo with MP3 sap and set up for satellite radio, AC will freeze you out, (good thing) Seats are comfortable, ride is a little rough because of the 4X4 suspension.",A little more interior room would be great. All of these small trucks suffer from the elbow room problem.
4.125,Lots for the Money,Average Joe ,12/10/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,5,4,"After puting the last 20K, of 107K,  on a 1997 model, I bought the 2008.  Not much change, but ""if it aint broke don't fix it!"" These little trucks will give you much economical utility and reliabilty.  When you are not ""trucking"" it is decently comfortable transportation for two. ",Surprisingly quiet comfortable ride. ,"The ""cloth seat"" option, with considerably improved comfort, should be standard. "
2.75,Look Elsewhere,Bill ,11/03/2007,,,2,3,1,3,,3,4,2,4,"This past week I took delivery of a loaded 2008 Ford Ranger XLT.  On the trip home from the out-of-town Ford dealership where I purchased the Ranger, the drivers side suicide door developed a rattle.  I took my Ranger to a local Ford dealer to correct the problem.  While the local dealer did make substantial improvement in eliminating the door rattle, I was informed that body work would be required to fully correct the problem.

4.875,Awesome,eaglesdude00 ,10/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The Ford Ranger is an awesome truck to buy. It looks good, and has plenty of power to go offroading with. I love my Ranger, and drive it everyday. If you have the choice, get 4-wheel drive, it makes a huge difference!","4-wheel drive, interior, wheels and tires, engine.",None
