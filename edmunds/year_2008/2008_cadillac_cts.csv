5,Bang for your buck Queen,Jordan ,07/17/2016,4,4,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I purchased my 2008 Cadillac CTS4 with the 3.6 direct inject V6 engine and most of the bells and whistles. The only options I did not get were navigation and parking pack. I have to start with the power train in this vehicle. The 305hp direct inject V6 is an absolute peach. Smooth, refined, and power all over the band. It's also very quiet, until you push it past 3500rpm, then she starts to growl. It's a great noise for a Luxury V6. The tranny, a 6-speed automatic, is one of the best I've ever used. It's buttery smooth and knows where (what gear) it needs to be. I've never had issues with either. Always follow the factory maintenance guide and requirements for maintenence. The all-wheel drive is great. I live in Buffalo, NY, and if there is one thing people know about Buffalo, is that we get a lot of snow. It puts the power down well. This car is also incredibly comfortable. I owned a small econo-car previously, and my back would cry at trips longer than 45mins... This car, no complaints at all. Very comfortable seats with 10-way adjustability. I'm very big on nice interiors, and the interior of this car sold me on it. It's beautifully laid out, nice use of perforated leather, soft-touch plastics, and wood trim throughout. I got the panoramic moon roof as well, which is beautiful during the night, or soaking up the sun rays on cooler days. There are, however, creaks and rattles all over the cabin. It's a shame, but the car is also cheaper to own than foreign competitors, so it's expected to see corners cut in places. The only other complaint I have about the interior is outward visibility. The pillars are very thick. It hasn't been a huge problem, but noticeable. Exterior is subjective. I was never really a fan of the look, only because my little eyes can see cost-cutting corners shaved. But, it is a sharp looking, handsome design. Modern amenities such as HID headlamps and LED light bars throughout make her a beauty in the night. I also opted for the 18"" polished aluminum wheels and spoiler, which make the car look a little more upscale and aggressive, respectively, in my opinion. Driving the car had been very nice. Smooth over rough roads, good road manners, although the weight does tend to want to drag it around corners sometimes, great steering feel, and plenty of V6 power. 0-60 has been run at 6.3 seconds for me at the track, on 93 premium. Practicality is good, not great(this is a luxury sedan after all). Fuel economy roughly 19-20 mpg combined city/highway. Cost of ownership has been low for luxury levels. Maybe I'm ""lucky"" or maybe I properly maintain my vehicle. Either way, outside of normal maintenance (oil, tires, brakes, etc.) and a few minor electrical faults (all have been very cheap (>$20) fixes or under warranty) this car hasn't caused me a single headache. If you are looking at buying one, DO YOUR HOMEWORK!! look at owner history, service history, car fax reports, etc!! Can't stress this enough. The car is a fantastic car, especially at the price you'll find them. But, it needs to have been properly maintained and taken care of.",,

3,Is it ever home and will it get me there?,Virginia Swisher ,01/24/2016,27,3,3,,,1,3,2,4,,,"10 months ago I bought a Cadillac CTS and what a nightmare.  I needed to replace the 2003 Buick Century with 190,000 miles on it. I've have had several GTM cars in the past and wanted to keep with GM, and this was going to be my birthday splurge. I decided to look for a used car with lower mileage, rather than a new car because I was on a limited budget.  I had looked at Chevy Impalas, Buicks  and found that they were exceeding my budget- so just as a whim- I looked on the internet at Cadillac and was seeing that there were a few that were in the same range as the Impalas. (I did CarFaxes on every car I looked at & before I took it for a test drive - this car came with a positive report- one owner, garage kept, well maintained, & 50,000 miles on it & it looked brand new- nothing to indicate that there would be any problems. ) So in comparing a Cadillac CTS to and  the Impalas- I thought I was getting a higher quality car- not so.  I picked it up at the end of February-        (they gave me a 3 month warranty).  In April, the check engine light came on- it needed a new coil (not cover by the warranty)  $500: in June, the catalytic convertor went (cover by the warranty, otherwise it would have been at least $700).  In July I took it in for an oil change and a check up and was informed it would need new brakes on the rear by the end of November (this would cost at least $400- wound up costing $500).  In September it just passed inspection (mostly because of the brake issue).  The middle of October, I was heading to work and there was the horrible clanking noise coming from the wheels- (no warring), managed to get to the dealership (which has been in business for over 80 years) and left it there. Next day they informed me that the drive shaft had broken (don't know how or why) and it would cost $1500 (they took off $250 from the bill). I informed them I was extremely unhappy and nervous about driving the car and I needed to talk to customer service.  She listed to me politely, said she wanted me to be secure with the car and they would take it in and do a complete check up on the car to make sure everything was working right.  They did that, then one week later I as was coming home from work, I heard this big thump. I got out of the car to check it and saw nothing- got back in the car and it went nowhere- the transmission went on the car.  I called the dealership and they couldn't believe this happened.  They gave me a loaner for the 6 days they had my car. The bill came to $2500, but I paid $750 (they got GM to cover most of it under a warranty).  At This point, I can't trust the car and began to talk to my salesperson, customer service and head of use car sales about  getting me out of this car (between the sales price and repairs, I have spent over $20,000 + the dealership has put in $3000 in repairs). My salesperson showed me another CTS, a year younger than mine w/ less mileage. So he discussed it with the head of use car sales, and he informed me that  they could only give me $10,000 for the car.  I can't afford to throw $10,000 down the drain and then spend an additional $7500 to get into that new car, so I left asking that they keep eye out for something comparable that I could afford.  I became resolved that I would have to keep  this car, so I put the new brakes on  at the beginning of December and hoped for the best.  On the Monday after Christmas, on the way home from work, the car began to vibrate violently as I began to accelerate.   Again I called the dealership and manage to get it there, and then left it.  They called me  the next day and informed me the car was fixed at no charge  (it turned out to be 2 coils & 2 spark plugs needed to be replaced- that would have cost over $700). I have checked into Lemon Laws- my car does not qualify, talked to a  friend who is a lawyer, called Cadillac Corporate to file a complaint- but no help.  I cannot in good conscious sell this car to anyone else without divulging the history of this car & once hearing about it who would buy it from me.  (I do have to say that the dealership has been reasonable about discounting the repairs and I appreciate this, but I have never had so many problems with one car in my life time- and I have purchased older cars in the past. This car has been in the shop 8 times in 10 months- this is not right!!!!!Update-  it's been 18 months since I bought this car- Back in March another coil went on it- fed-up- the estimate for this repair was $700.00. .  So this meant that 3 out if the 6 coils had to be replace. If I calculated it right it  would cost me an addition  approximately $2800 to the replace the rest of  the coils- one at a time.  I discussed it with the dealership  as to how much it would cost me to replace all of the rest of the coils- it came to $1400. So I had it done and so far -so good, but I keep telling this car if it doesn't behave , it's in the junk yard",,

4,What is everyone complaining about?,Rick Croak ,12/11/2015,5,4,4,,,5,5,5,4,,,"I bought my 2008 CTS direct injection new. Granted, I only have 55,000 miles but so far the car has only been to the dealer twice, under warranty.  Once for a part in the rear suspension and once for the XM radio receiver.  Other than that, the tires were replaced at 50,000 miles and I have changed the oil every 6-7000 miles,  based on the computer, or once per year. Also, being a C6 Z06 Corvette owner, I know what performance is about.  This CTS is a joy to drive and can really get up and go. The only gripe I have with it is an engine vibration ( I believe caused from engine strain from staying in gear too long) at 45 MPH. It could probably be adjusted out, but I can not see spending the money to have it fixed. The only other issue is that the trade in value is so low that I cannot make myself trade it because the car is so enjoyable to drive. Otherwise, I would probably have a new CTS.",,
2.875,Car of the year?,jimboc240 ,09/09/2013,,,3,4,2,3,,3,4,2,2,"I owned the CTS4 with every option since new. (as well as many many other vehicles) I was generally happy with it, especially how it ran in the snow. You can't beat AWD. For a V6, it can move pretty well. The navigation and Bose sound system is probably its best point. It seemed to do everything well, but nothing stands out. I love our country, but the Germans really are on top in the quality department. On the surface, the interior looks nice, but the leather is thin, and everything else is just cheap plastic.The drivers seat broke. They wanted 1200 to fix it. It came with ""heated windshield washers"" but they disengaged it due to failure after 1 year. With no fix possible. ",The look is good. The audio is superb.,"Get rid of the cheap plastic look and feel. Look at the competition as far as general workmanship is concerned. The key fob is super cheap, and it won't last long."
3.5,The Love Affair is Over,jguerin77 ,08/12/2013,,,5,5,2,2,,2,5,3,4,"I have decided that owning a Cadillac CTS is like dating a beautiful woman with a black heart: they are gorgeous to look at, but they will do you wrong every time. I had a 2004 CTS first, and I had multiple security issues with it requiring trips to the dealer to fix. The my son totaled it when he hit a deer doing 75MPH. I do like the looks of the CTS, so I bought a 2008 CTS 4 as a replacement. It had 28,000 mi. I have had many issues with it as well. First, it uses oil, and the oil MUST be checked every 1500 miles or you will be in trouble. I checked mine at 3000 (after a #60 oil change since it uses synthetic oil), and NO oil registered on the dipstick. No leaks. CTSs just use oil. ",Looks great. Mechanically a dud.,"I have had two recalls on this car, back door lock had had to be fixed, driveshaft snapped in two on a trip, and it took 3 WEEKS to get it fixed. Never did get my rental car reimbursement. Passenger side AC gauge was stuck at 60, and the part is $700. I left it broken. Now the service air bag light came on, and it is $1,000 for the part. The tire sealant air pump that came with my car worked one time and s now defective and has to be replaced despite me having spent $38 bucks to refill it. When you get your checkbook out to pay for this car, just keep it open. You will continue to pay as long as you own it. Very disappointed!"
4.375,Happy Owner,majsharan ,03/24/2013,,,4,5,3,4,,5,5,4,5,"I have owned my Cadillac CTS since 2008 when I bought it fully loaded during the bankruptsy and employee pricing wars for $35,000. At that point the '09s were out so I also got rebates for buying the old model year. I have been generally very happy with purchase. A couple of issues mostly relating to fit and finish. The car has some spots where the wood accents aren't quite large enough to fill the space they are in so there a couple of gaps here and there. Also, the car has a pretty bad paint job for a luxury car. It was like they only put one coat of clear on it. The car also has some interior rattles that seem to come from the bowels of the dash and can't be held down to be stopped. ",Safety. I was in a T bone crash that totaled the other car and all they had to do was replace my bumper and front right panel. ,More clear coats.

3.375,2008 CTS Blown Engine/Oil Consumption/GM fails to act,jmdhale ,09/19/2012,,,4,4,2,2,,4,4,3,4,"I purchased a 2008 Cadillac CTS with 31K which was also the mileage at which the oil had been changed. My wife being the primary driver averages 33 miles a day and is very easy on the vehicle. At 41K the car threw a rod resulting in blown engine.At the advice of GM the car was taken to my local Cadillac for repairs. Although the vehicle only has 41K and the power train warranty is for 100K Covert told me there is nothing they can do as my power train warranty expired 2 days prior to the break down. For $10,000 they will put a new engine in for me.GM continues to tell me the warranty is good up to 100K, but states I failed to properly maintain my vehicle.I purchased the car with 31,217 miles on it and have documentation from dealership showing the oil was changed at 31,107 miles.The attached excerpt from my 2008 Cadillac CTS Manual states you vehicle computer will let you know when to change the engine oil and filter. This is based on engine revolutions and temperature, and not on mileage.It goes on to say that one may not need to change their oil, but once a year. When Cadillac turned over their review to GM the local Service Manager wrote that our vehicle was 6977 miles overdue for an oil change.The dealership went on to tell me that we should have the oil changed every 5k to 6k. Although the manual specifically states mileage is not a determining factor. Also using the 5K to 6K logic and the fact my oil was changed at 31K we would have been due for an oil change at 37K which based on their equation would only be 3K over not the 6977 reported to GM which resulted in denying my claim. Again GM states mileage in not a factor in oil changes. We owned the car just over 8 months and have only put 9,500 miles on the car. The dealership is stating the car ran completely out of oil and it was our fault. How does oil disappear when we have no leaks? This is not possible and Ive spoken to numerous certified mechanics who stated cars do not run out of oil in 9,000 miles unless you have a leak or the car has an oil usage issue which is the fault of the maker. Note this vehicle has 37 recall or service notices some related to power train and cooling systems.

It has been in the shop 4 times for major repairs-oil consumption, catalytic converter replacement, piston rings, cam shaft shims, steering and just this morning, the passenger airbag light is not working! I would expect these types of repairs on a 1980 Ford not a brand new Cadillac.

5,2nd CTS and probably not the last,cadillacmike ,12/22/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is our 2nd CTS. the first was a Black 2005 with EVERY option except block heater (we're in FL folks) and pearl paint. This one is the same, in light platinum (looks like the silver on my 2009 STS). It also has AWD. The 2005 went strongly to 117,000 miles when we traded it; this one is up to 30,000.No major issues, but the ultraview sunroof is too noisey, something's loose because i can push up on the divider and the noise goes away. Handling is superb, inside room is good (I also have a Fleetwood and like my room), performance is outstanding. Noise level will be great once the roof is fixed. Eye appeal is without par, wife gets compliments on the chrome wheels all the time. ","While the 2005 CTS took a few hits from the pundits, it was a very well executed car. I also have a 2009 NorthStar STS, so the 'bar' is set very high. The 2008 looks far nicer than the 2005, the head & tail lights look more 'refined' & the grill is sharper. The interior is much nicer as well. We miss the nice 17"" 7 spoke polished wheels from the 2005, but we were able to get a set of the factory 18s chromed and they do look very good. The HDD based Nav is the best thing, you can copy CDs & USB MP3s to it. The sound system is very powerful. The big sunroof can let a lot of light (and heat here in FL ) in. Interior finish is very well done as is the cabin lighting. Well done Cadillac!!!","Should not have to go to 18"" wheels for V & W rated tires. I can just imagine what a set of 18"" 50 series tires will cost. 17s would have been fine. Yeah i know they have to 'bling' it up, but..
Remote entry / exit settings are psychotic. it moves the seat forward AND tilts the wheel down BEFORE you even get in. The 2005 had this perfect; it moved the seat to the EXIT position when you unlocked it and it had a manual tilt (much better). Then when you put the key in to start, it moved the seat to the memory position. The 2008 is all wrong.
The HDD while it is supposed to copy single tracks off a CD or MP3, won't do it, it only copies the entire disc.

At 30,000 miles Cadillac had to replace my engine. The car burns oil and you will not make the recommended 10k between oil changes. I now have 38k miles and i discovered rain water in my passenger seat floor. lastly, I just experienced a major transmission problem that resulted in flames coming out the side of the car. if you are thinking of buying this car, I would suggest you spend the 50k on a car built with better quality.

The interior lighting looks unbelievable.  And the best part is that the car was so much less then the BMW 3 series, Audi A4 and the Mercedes C class.  GM really did a tremendous job on this car.  I would highly recommend this Cadillac to anyone in the market for a luxury midsized car.",Everything about the car.  But I most likely like the 303 horse power engine.,None!

The car was either the same or outperformed all the other cars.  The layout of the cockpit is fantastic.  The car rides great and people notice the beauty of the car as well.  My car has everything expect for Navigation and the Moonroof.  With Onstar I felt I didn't need the Nav. That saves you a lot of $$.  I would recommend this car to anyone in the market for a luxury high performance car.  Definitely get the DI version.

Every stinking day we got into our 2006 5 series another warning light was on the dash.  BMW Service Good Riddance!    We absolutely adore this new CTS.   So far no service issues after approx 2600 miles including round trip to Colorado from Atlanta.,"After spending Two day driving over 6 hours per day, this vehicle has to be One of the most comfortable, enjoyable ride we have ever purchased.

I was hoping it would live up to the hype after the long wait it exceeded it & I was not disappointed. This car is awesome. I also own a 2007 Corvette and truly believe the CTS handles if not better, then at least as well as the vette (but obviously not as fast!).  The CTS is really quick though, refined, handles great, and with great mileage.  I avg 22 in town and have gotten as much as 32 on the highway while driving 70 & 80 mph.","Exterior styling, refined interior, the double sunroof, and the technology such as the pop up nav and hard disk drive for the radio, etc.","Only ONE.

5,A True American Contender,Al and Rene ,08/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After considering the Mercedes C350, Lexus IS350, Infinity G37S, and the BMW 5 Series, my wife and I decided on the 2008 CTS. The ride, the looks, the interior ergonomics and options were great. The quality of fit and trim, along with the value of the available features, trumped the competition. We decided that we wanted a vehicle that did not look like anything else on the road and this 2008 CTS does just that with the looks it commands from passersby. It truly is a car that turns us on when we turn it on! ","When the two of us are riding in the CTS, the Ultraview Roof  the individual contoured heated and vented seats  encapsulating cockpit design  and the ambient lighting at night, gives us the feeling of riding along in our own personal individualized luxury compartments. GM got this one right!","Rear view Camera,a little more low-end torque,in-mirror turn indicators, middle headrest in rear seat - but regardless of when we arrive at our destination; we feel as if we have arrived  in a true American Contender!"

5,Love it,soccerj3 ,07/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was looking for a fun and roomy drive.  Still needed a large backseat for the kiddies.  I had test driven Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and many small SUVs.  Couldn't stomach the monthly payments on them as they just were not appealing to me.  Once I got behind the wheel of the CTS (black with creamy leather) I was sold.  So much fun to drive and the kids are comfortable in the back.  I love this car!  I will update on reliability as the months progress.","Gorgeous exterior. Very unique.

The BMWCCA magazine Roundel recently did a comparo between the CTS and the 5 series and concluded that not only was the CTS an excellent auto inside and out, but was virtually the equal of the BMW for over $10K less.  After driving the Cadillac and seeing it up close, I agreed with the assessment.   ","Not only is the Cadillac CTS wonderful to drive, its fit and finish is equal to the best of the imports, and exceeds them in style and extras.  Functionality is thoughtful and impressive - with the AWD system, and with the fold down rear seat you get most of the cargo space you get from a SUV.","None. I never thought I would own a GM car, but this one absolutely knocked my socks off on style, utility, and most importantly, value.   Bravo Cadillac!  I can finally own a wonderful American car again."

Sometimes I'll just take it out on the road for the sheer fun of driving it.,Exterior design. It's black with the beige interior. The perfect combo I think.,Hard turns can be a struggle for it and I've felt some wobble in the steering. The gas mileage is terrible. I'm averaging 12 mpg.

Never in a million years did I think I would own a Cadillac!  Having said that, this car should cause any reasonable person to change their opinion on GM.  Clearly, Bob Lutz and the Caddy design team deserve a lot of credit for bringing a legendary brand back to life.  This is a no apologies sedan that brings a watermelon smile every time I look at or talk about this car!  Nothing looks like it on the road and it looks great!

I've owned new BMW 5, new BMW 3, and new Audi 6 and the new 2008 CTS not only belongs in this class but outshines them all with ext/int design and features.  You definitely get more and more for your money.  The direct inject 304 hp engine is there to perform when needed.  The sport suspension package with 19"" wheels has the CTS hugging the road and gives it the tight feel. I love this car...it's the best 4 dr sport sedan I've owned and if Cadillac continues to deliver quality and VALUE there's no reason to go back to BMW, Audi, or consider others like Lexus.

5,Best Sports Sedan in its price class,Dr. Mike ,06/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had the new CTS for three months and this is the most enjoyable automobile that I have ever owned.  All aspects of the vehicle are pleasing.  The performance is world class and the interior is set up in a convenient and comfortable manner.  The sound system is killer and the Nav is best in class.  However, the Onstar turn-by- turn is so simple and cool that I tend to use it instead of the Nav system.  I love the total lighting package from the very cool ambient interior lights to the trick light pipes in the front and rear.

It's a car seemingly made for my demographic. I've never driven a car that turns as many heads and gets as many compliments and inquiries as this one does.  The steering feel and handling are superb. The throttle response and manumatic shifting can take some effort to be smooth, but that kind of adds to the fun.  The car likes to rev, but it lacks low end torque. It feels a little slow until you hit around 3500 RPM, at which point it takes off almost unpredictably quickly.  I also have a strange odor coming from the air vents, and have since day one. Not sure what that's about.","Exterior looks, steering wheel, iPod connection (though it should be digital, not analog,) shifter feel, interior design, including the real wood, the warm look that the forever- gray BMWs and Mercedes' lack, and the driving position. Running on regular gas is a very nice feature as well.","Cadillac should give up trying to push OnStar over Bluetooth connectivity. What a simple feature to lack in my $50k CTS.

Handling nice, ride exceptional, quite, except for when you push it.  Sound coming out of the tail pipes makes you say bring it on.  This thing looks mean coming at you.  All the tech works nicely.

This is the best design and execution of what I've owned and compared the CTS to. In two months, the CTS has been driven through heavy rain, ice and snow. It handles as well as any 4x4 I've owned. I traded my STS V8 and never looked back. It is by far the most tactile, entertaining, and visually pleasurable vehicle yet. I drove the A4 and 325 AWD's. In comparison, the CTS controls are the most intuitive. I could not figure out how to turn the BMW/Audi radios off during the test drive! With the CTS as good as it is, we cannot wait for the replacement of our DTS perfomance sedan. ","OnStar and it's features. AWD for mountain, bad weather driving.

3.75,Wish I had bought a Lexus,Alan ,01/12/2008,,,5,5,4,1,,5,5,2,3,"The CTS has many fine qualities - ride, stability, sound system, interior design.  But the lack of certain features many of which are found on less expensive cars such a fog lights and a back-up camera, along with poor gas mileage (20% less than my 2003 CTS), and 7 days in the repair shop in the first 90 days of ownership tell me I should have bought a Lexus.  ",Sound system - I could listen to XM all day and night.,Manula highlights poor rear visibility -  needs a rear view camera like the Accord.  Fog lights would be a great help on the rainy winter mornings.  Accord has them what not the CTS?  Reliability - 7 days in the shop in the first 90 days of ownership - not a stellar record.

We have had three Volvos in the last ten years and have been satisfied with all of them. But when I drove the 2008 CTS i was amazed with the drive and looks and feel of the car. I love to sit and play with all the interior features. I find myself asking my wife if she needs something from the store.","Smoothness of the ride, quality of the build, esthetics of the exterior.

For the money paid out the door including tax, the 08 CTS has to be the best deal we have come across. Test driving the vehicle around the block, and it was a must own.    Already have 3400 miles on the car, and we fight off our 19 year old son for the keys!    ","Seats are nearly perfect, as the heat/cool fans work exactly as advertised.

4.875,Lots to like,OttawaUser ,12/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My CTS has the FE3 suspension and the 304 hp direct injection engine.  Performance: I like to drive quickly. Power, tracking, grip and dynamics are all excellent. Performance brakes are really powerful (but touchy at low speeds), and also necessate 18"" wheels for snow tires - 17"" won't fit. In sport mode the auto transmission matches speeds perfectly, a bit less smooth in regular mode.  Interior is put together really well. Feels much roomier than G35. Seats very good. Controls very well thought out. Stereo with 40 GB HDD is truely awesome. My only quibble - needs more storage bins in front and a place for sunglasses.  Overall I love it and find myself  looking for excuses to drive.","Power, braking, handling and dynamics. Well put together interior. Extra interior room compared to competition. I am tall and got mine w/o sunroof. Uses regular unleaded. The whole package is really well put together. ","Bigger storage bins and provide a sunglasses holder.

It rides so well I'm finding places to go just so I can drive it. Steering is tight a just the right amout of road feel without being too harsh. Traded my 2005 Audi A6 which I liked but got too frustrated with Audi because they Claimed the noises in my car from the heating vents were ""characteristic"" of the car and there was nothing they would do about it. If your looking for a ""sorts"" sedan, check out the CTS, you won't be dissappointed. ","Handling, great Bose 10 speaker sound system, comfortable seats, amazing interior",Remote acess key should give you the option of locking the car withh a button on the door handle instead of it locking automaticcally when you walk away from the car.

Build quality was excellent and I experienced only minor repairs over 35,000 miles. It still is a real ""looker"".  But my new loaded Crystal Red 08 CTS is about the most perfect car I have ever had. It blows away just about every BMW, Audi and Mercedes on the road today. It is stunningly beautiful, excellent fit and finish, with options galore and the handling is remarkable. The styling and performance improvements in the 08 are obvious, but it is the subtle nuances and thoughful engineering that make the car a standout for me. I can't tell a Lexus from a Camry until up close, but there's no mistaking this Caddy at any distance !","The hot 304 HP DI engine (26 mpg highway), intuitive simplified controls, great pop up NAV and HDD features, Ultraview roof, cooled seats, the ambient lighting at night, the high quality and style of the interior, adaptive headlights, the front end, the feel of a luxury car that performs precisely !","Bring back the ability to beam my address book into the nav system, the steering wheel is a little too low when getting in and out."

My previous car was an '06 Audi A6.  Very impressed with this new Cadillac...the CTS has an amazing ride-handling combination, great power with the DI engine, and awesome looks. The perceived quality is on par (if not better) with the top German and Japanese offerings. Time will tell about long term reliability.","Suspension, steering, ride, handling, interior quality and ambiance are all world-class.  Exterior has great ""presence"" on the road.  Excellent navigation and superb sound system.","AWD transfer case takes up too much room in the passenger footwell.  A little more storage space would be nice.  And of course, Bluetooth."
4.5,Finally a true American sports sedan,Todd K. ,11/19/2007,,,5,4,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"I've had my '08 CTS for about a month now, and the commercials are spot on - this car turns me on every time I fire it up.  It's a real head turner, and I've gotten more looks and thumbs ups than with any other car. Mine has the 6 speed w/ DI engine, and most every option available. I say most options because one that I really wanted - AWD, was not available with the stick.  I test drove the G35X, BMW 335iX, Audi A4 Quattro and finally the CTS and it was love at first sight. The CTS is really that good, and a bit bigger than the others. I really wanted AWD and I might have a different opinion after the snow falls, but I'm planning in investing in a decent set of snow tires.  We'll see..","The aroma of the leather in this Cadillac is intoxicating. I find myself sitting in the car just to breathe it in, and to listen to the incredible Bose surround system. This is by far the best factory system that I have ever heard. Listen and smell for yourself, you won't be disappointed.","AWD, with the 6 speed. I almost didn't buy this car because I really wanted AWD, but I didn't want to give up the manual. I would trade up in a heartbeat if this combo was available next model year - maybe '09?

4.875,Back to American,randvlip ,11/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Once was a true blue American car buyer. During a period with no contract, I sold Toyotas and bought into the foreign car hype. However, something about the engines never gave me the feel of muscle in the engines of an American. This car has the get up and go I grew up with, yet the luxury I've grown to expect. I have the 304 DI with the Performance package which combined really gives a superior driving experience. And oh, BTW Sunset Blue has chameleon characteristics that may make you not recognize your car depending on the time of day and/or the light it's in. I love it.","OnStar, XM radio, Adaptive front lighting, Ultraview sunroof, ambient interior lighting, 304 HP DI Engine, Bose sound system.

4.875,Wow,Mike ,11/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Waited  7 weeks and 1 day for cars arrival after factory order.  Even though I had seen hundreds of photos in magazines and television ads, I was stunned by the car's beauty and design in person.  And this is from a guy that owns an 07 MB S550 and 06 MB CLS500. The White Diamond paint is outstanding as is the build quality. The interior is excellent as well. I can't imagine anyone not being pleased with this vehicle.  I got on the freeway and opened it up a bit and was very happy with the response and smoothness of the egine and transmission.  Kudos to General Motors.",Outstanding design and workmanship. Firm and sporty ride but not harsh over bumps. I was pleasantly pleased with the ease of access to the rear seat and the leg room.,Would like to see overhead sunglass holder.

4.875,Finally a real competitor,Aeryc ,10/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Already owned 2 Cadillacs and had no intentions of replacing my 2004 CTS with another Cadillac.  However, my dealer called me when the 2008 came in and insisted I drive it.  Needless to say I feel in love and I couldn't pass up the deal.  GM finally blew me away with this car and kept me as a customer.  Purchased a fully loaded Crystal Red with the 3.6 Direct Inject engine.

5,Red Hot 2008 CTS4,anselmoc5 ,10/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We bought this loaded 2008 CTS to replace our base model 2004 CTS.  What a huge step up! Ours is exactly like the Crystal Red CTS4 seen in all of the ads. This car draws a great deal of attention when we are out in it. An 800 mile road trip in the first week of ownership proved to be a most pleasurable drive. The car handles like a sports cars and the 304 HP V6 sure feels like a V8.  The ride is Cadillac quality but with a nice sporty road feedback.  All of the chatter about the sunroof letting in too much light proved to be a non- issue.  Even with the light Cashmere interior the sun shade blocked out the sun's rays just fine. This is a truely great car to own! ,The navigation and 10 speaker Bose sound system are great.  We love the heated and cooled seats along with the remote starting. Also the HID lights are superb!  Our biggest issue with the 04 CTS was poor handling in snow but now with AWD the CTS is the perfect luxury/sports car to own!  ,Yes Bluetooth would have been nice but we can live without it.  There is a slight color mismatch between the bumber covers and the body panels in the Crystal Red but it still is a great color.  I miss having a auto- dimming left side mirror like in my 2003 Anniversary Corvette.
5,This ain't your daddy's caddy,Caddy gone perfect! ,10/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Be prepared to be impressed - from putting on some of Cadillac's color options - to the extensive standard equipment, all are better on this car. If the same level of attention paid in planning then building this car can be transfered to others in the GM Family - watch out world for market share will return back to the USA! ",By far the suspension combined with the engine - providing the most positive and exciting driving experience.  Other than for the prestige need for more HP - this car competes and wins against much more expensive choices.,Honestly - I have yet to find any necessary or even unnecessary improvements that could be suggested.  Perhaps faster production so the wait for the nearly perfect car is less.
4,Maybe expectations were too high,brown343 ,10/23/2007,,,4,5,3,3,,4,4,5,4,"Came off a lease of an Audi A4. The CTS was a new design for 08, which was appealing. Seriously considered the BMW 335xi also. Having more rear leg room and supporting an American company were the deciding factors. However, build quality of my A4 was much better than the CTS. Have already had the CTS in for steering (wheel shakes) and navigation problems.  Spending 4 hours at the dealership with a two week-old $48,000 vehicle is quite discouraging. Steering feels ""disconnected"" from car at times, especially during aggressive driving.  Fuel-injectors make a noticeable, annoying hum. Thanks go to a great stereo to mask this. Upon close inspection, my black paint has factory flaws.","The CTS is a sharp looking car.  Considering the 304 horsepower, it gets good gas mileage.  Plus, no need for premium.  It's great to get a lot more horsepower than my A4, and still get equivalent mileage.","Steering. Noise from fuel-injectors. More controls need to be illuminated. Have to feel around for many controls (homelink, vents, etc). Considering the size of the car, interior space seems small and could be better utilized (center stack takes up a lot). Don't use velcro!

4.5,My 3rd CTS,PittDriver ,10/21/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"Leased an '03 and then an '05. The new '08 improves on every aspect of the CTS both the good and the not so good. Huge improvements in the interior. Ride, suspension, handling all even better than before, and the handling was already great. I'm delighted to see GM's initial success in design mature so well. Growing up, I loved Caddies so it's satisfying to be driving one as a grown up. (Brings out the teen in me when I'm behind the wheel.) My CTS is, without any exceptions or explanations, every bit as good or better than what Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and Infiniti can turn out for the money. That's improtant to me, since it would be great to keep driving cars like this made by GM.","Exterior still says CTS, but pushes the design forward. Sleek and sexy. Seats much improved. Radio and Bose sound are superb. Love the LED light tubes in the front and rear lamp housings. Double sunroof is slick. My favorite feature is how it drives on SW PA's twisty country roads.

That's right, the 2008 Cadillac CTS walked all over the Avalon for quality  Three out of four Avalons I considered had very noticeable interior fit-and-trim problems.

A black CTS in the showroom had (afater market) 20"" chrome wheels and a feature set at least $6 - $10K better than Lexus and BMW. Just to be thorough, we drove it.  Amazing ride. Stunning. I'm still smiling. Everything everybody is saying.  I just kept thinking, ""This is a Caddy?"" I couldn't beleive it. Only several days later, but I'm still giddy. I love this car. Fast, smooth, quiet, responsive, corners on rails. There isn't enough room in this review space.  Trust me:  drive this car! ","NAV, XM Traffic, hard drive, double sunroof, spaciousness, on-dash leather, ambient lighting (love this), the cooled seats.  I can't beleive how much I love this car.  This is a Caddy?  Oh, the 20"" Gianelle wheels and Toyo Proxes 4 tires look amazing on the car.  Not technically an option, but...","I don't use Bluetooth, but I recognize that they should probably have it.  I'd like to have seen a back- up camera in the NAV. That's the only feature not offered that was in the other cars we drove.  It has parking assist, but still would have liked the camera."
5,Wow,teresa ,10/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great car all around. I've been looking for 4months, BMW, MB, Lexus and this one beats them hands down! Performance, quality, and value. This is my first Caddy and I'm proud","Detailed stitching in the dash, sporty drive and handling, stereo",None at time
4.875,Foreign cars eat ur hearts out!,LB ,10/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car rocks! It's the red one on TV and magazine covers; I got it fully featured, but opted for the Auto vs Manual shift. It replaced my '03 CTS that I loved (and so did my BMW-owning friends....more room!) I obliged my Mercedes and Audi loving relatives by considering them, but hands down this CTS packs more punch/value for every buck. I find it a smooother ride than the Europeans. It has more useful features than my cousin's limited edition Audi that cost $80K. He said he has no iPod connector nor USB port, nor 36 preset channels, nor as much room in the back seat for clients as I do. The teenagers in my neighborhood went crazy over it.  Talk about not being Dad's car anymore!","It's smokin' beautiful! Great sound system, superb handling, 40GB hard drive, smooth ride, so quiet, luxurious ambient lighting, and remote start to cool my seats & forget this is Florida. The NAV is also quite a step up from my former CTS (which I always used). Ultra comfortable, too, of course.",Center console storage area could be bigger as in the older CTS.
5,CTS beats BMW,James Evans ,10/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My new CTS is awesome!  I've had it for just about a month and now have 2K miles on it.  It's a thrilling ride and looks gorgeous. When I bought my CTS  I researched and test drove all the major competitors (BMW 3 Series, Mercedes C Class, etc.) and the CTS beat them all in drive, HP, leg room (I'm 6' 2"" and have enough room to even sit in the back) and in looks. This is my first Caddy but won't be my last.","40 GB hard drive, 304 HP engine, OnStar (I never thought I would want this, but after using the directions I wouldn't want a car without it) and the styling. Caddy has hit a home run.",How about a coupe version.
4.875,This CTS has all the right ingredients,B.Smith ,10/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I was considering the 3-series, 5- series, and Acura TL in addition to this vehicle. I'd have been happy with any of them I think, but the CTS had that extra bit. The technology was abundant and easy to use. The performance was amazing on twisty lake side roads. I've driven it about a 1000 miles so far on business trips and my customers gush over it and I sit in comfort the whole while. Get the air conditioned seats! I also appreciated the DFI engine over the standard and am getting about 28 mpg on the freeway. 20 mpg in town.","Navigation screen, interior design, sound system, huge sunroof, Porsche like handling, and the young aggressive styling. Lastly, air conditioned seats for Texas and black leather are awesome.","The front body of the car is prone to be very close if not in line with parking bumps. If you're like me in the habit of rolling forward till the tires make contact, you'll want to amend your habit or scratch it up a bit on the bottom. Needs bluetooth.  Needs a Sirius radio conversion or option"
4.875,I love this car!,Karen ,10/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've only had the car for 2 weeks, but it's been my dream car for years and I waited for the 2008s as I heard they were much improved.  I love this car more than I ever imagined I would.  It's quiet, comfortable, easy to drive and everyone stops to look at it.  The sunset blue color is really something to look at.",I especially love the overall look of the exterior of the car and the color.,
4.625,Good after initial glitch w/ fuel gauge,CTS-dad ,10/02/2007,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,This car has not disappointed us.  We have had it for one month now.  The car is very quiet; we cannot understand how anyone could have any complaints about noise. One disappointment: our car needed service during the first week we had it (fuel gauge was inaccurate and we ran out of gas on first trip...showed 1/4 tank when it was actually empty. Static electricity must have fried a chip or something. This problem was fixed by dealer service in a few days).,6-speed automatic transmission and 6-speed sport mode. Very smooth acceleration and quiet ride.,"There is not enough storage space for sunglasses and other items.  Driver information system should include ""gallons used"". Gear shift is not wood as pictures show it should be. There needs to be a light along the gear shift lever for night-time."
5,GM Gets it right,Steve  ,09/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Went to buy an STS but settled on the CTS instead.  Love the sunroof with sunshade. The performance, economy, and handling are unbelievable in this car. Transmission very smooth. Got 26 miles to the gallon on first tank. Form and fit and interior design are way ahead of the competition. Thanks GM.  Traded a 2005 SRX.  ","Power and economy, heated and cooled seats.",Six disk CD player should be standard
4.75,08 CTS,CAC99 ,09/29/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Great car!  Most outstanding interior of any American car.  Exterior looks a little too flashy and front bumper is a little low, but still a classy looking car. Terrific build quality (way to go GM) and great driving characteristics.  Nice to see Cadillac come to market with new technology like great nav system, ""TiVO-like audio"" and voice command.  Disappointing to not see Bluetooth even offered - I bought on the promise that it will be retrofitted.",Interior design. Driving and ride quality. Technology advancements. Ergonomics  ,Bluetooth. Toned down grille. More front-end curb clearance
4.875,This CTS is amazing.,Sirgeek ,09/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I can't get over the features this car packs. The hard drive is fantastic.  The power and fuel economy together are both unbelievable.  I liked it for the exterior, but I love it for the interior. And it actually has good rear seat room. This is clearly Caddy's 5-series, but it feels more like a 3-series driving down the road (the curvier the better!)","Direct Injection engine. Hard drive radio/CD that rips CDs so you don't need to take them with you, and pauses/ records the radio while you're out of the car",
5,New AWD CTS is a winner,Concord Caddy ,09/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My 2004 CTS lease was up and I was contemplating a SRX for the reliability in the snow. I decided to drive the 2008 CTS-4 and was amazed at the improvements. Both interior and exterior this is a superior car to the 2004-07 versions. Even though I got the standard engine, it still has more muscle than what my 2004 had. I was really thinking SUV, but once I drove the CTS it was a no-brainer. I like everything about it, the cabin looks like a fighter jet cockpit, the controls are easy to navigate, and find. The body is rounder and has a more muscle car look to it versus the boxy earlier versions. Be careful! If you drive it, you may not be able to resist getting it.",Interior redesign with leather stitching around the dash and doors is a real classy look. Very roomy and lots of shoulder room in the front. Thinner seats give more leg room to the rear passengers.,Not sure if I like where they put the vehicle information system. It is hard to see behind the steering wheel and turn signal lever.
5,08 CTS Absolutely Tremendous!,Michael Lyon ,09/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car just rode from Miami Beach to St. Augustine Florida, directly after pickup from the dealer. The straight line handling compares to train rails, almost unbelievable engineering from Cadillac/GM. We hated getting out of the car after 5 hours!  Total joy, as you will swear your driving a V-8. This is the sweetest V-6 we have have ever driven for extended trips.","Engine ""down low"" power is outrageous. Regular gasoline with vehicles combined computer showing 25MPG. That's right 25 MPG!   Love this vehicle","Gotta have Blue tooth, come on GM why did you overlook this basic feature provided standard by Ford Focus! Detroit make this change 911"
5,Bmw 3? Audi a4? MB C280?? No thanks!,Dave ,09/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Unbelievable! Who needs the bmw 3, A4, or MB c class. This car looks amazing, it drives likes its got attitude. I have the 304 hp model with rear wheel dr. Fully loaded with the luxury package and navigation. The only thing this car is missing is blue tooth. there is zero road noise, you can only hear the engine at higher revs. ","Navigation, Rear drive with the sport package for the sporty drive. Ultra view roof is great, accent lighting at night is a nice touch as well with the wood trim.",Blue tooth. Everything else is great.

4.75,BMW Killer,BMW Killer ,09/16/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"Fully optioned: AWD, black with black, DI 300hp engine. MSRP is $48,090.  Which btw u cannot properly configure on Edmunds as the options they list differ somewhat then what Caddy actually will do. Without question the car draws attention. Ride is smooth & very tight  though w/18"" wheels expect to get plenty of road feel; which is a new experience with Caddy.  I extensively test drove the BMW 5 & 3 series and this car matches them in >95% of handling characteristics. A- Trans is like silk. Extremely minor flaw in fit, but it would only be noticed by perfectionists :).  Rides very quiet, except on hard accel where you hear it growl. Motortrend said motor is rough at idle,  but mine is smooth","36 preset radio stations!  Nav system is best have ever seen, beats MB and BMW. Pop-up screen is ultra cool.  Again,  this car is quiet with regards to exterior noise. The engine is also quiet except when really pushed, but the sound is cool. Remote start, keyless access should valuable in winter.","I would have paid extra for a multi- contour seat.  The seats are very good (about same as std BMW), but I am tall and would like the thigh support. On plus side front leg room is extraordinaty. Also,  needs deeper center storage unit. Pedals should adjust and more telescope on the wheel."
5,"Truly a ""10""",Bob Cornelssen ,09/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Picked up '08 CTS last day of August for my wife, wanted her to have the first one! This vehicle is outstanding. Tight, quiet, responsive with beautiful fit and finish. Ride is ""just right"", not too harsh and not too soft. Handling is superb. Feel sorry for those who paid thousands more for BMW's and Mercedes and got less car for the money.","Handling. So responsive and easy to drive. Fuel economy is excellent and can be in low 20's  in the City  with careful, conservative driving.",No suggestions or complaints.
4.75,My 2008 CTS,LaBorde ,09/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Replaced my 2005 STS with the CTS.

Owned 2 BMW 530i's and a C280 Mercedes before that.  Happy to see that there's an American car that finally measures up. Is it perfect - no?  Probably the only car in its class not to have bluetooth, but OnStar is GM's baby so I can live with my bluetooth earpiece and use the OnStar when needed. What I am impressed with is the styling, performace, and functionality. Got the 3.6DI with 304 horses and its definitely quicker than the 530i. The audio with XM and 40GB hard drive and centerpoint surround sound is sweet. Escalade-like styling makes it. ","Escalade-like styling. 304 horsepower performance. NAV with XM and 40GB hard drive. Overall, an American car that actually competes with Beemers and Benzes and doesn't look or drive like my dad's Caddy.","Needs bluetooth and a moonroof shade that isn't see- through. Also, limitations on NAV need to be improved."
5,2008 Cadillac CTS is fantastic!,joe2306 ,09/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have now had my 2008 CTS for about 10 days. I took delivery of a black with black leather with the 304 horsepower engine and all wheel drive that also has the 18 inch wheel package with all season tires and the upgraded suspension, etc. I also have the premium luxury collection (PDQ) that includes almost every option available on the car.  For background, I have owned the Lexus 400 series, the BMW 7 series, the BMW 5 series, the Audi A6 4.2, the Audi A8 and a number of other similar cars. This car is every bit as nice, particularly when you compare the price  This car is fantastic. It is beautiful inside and out and the stereo and nav functions are great and easy to use. Go see it!",The interior is gorgeous with the black leather. The 40 gig memory stereo is outstanding--I have already loaded about 10 CDs and the sound is excellent. The ride is comfortable and yet very competent in the twisty turns. It is not as sharp edged as a BMW but overall it is better for day to day use.,I am so happy with this car that I cannot think of any!
4.875,Caddy Gold,Shani Chainani ,09/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The new CTS is a beast of a different kind.  The car is completely redesigned but maintains the characteristics of the legendary first generation.  The front view of the car is aggressive, low to the floor, and makes a statement before you arrive at your destination.  The interior is by far the best, even topping BMW and Mercedes brands (which we were considering).  The driving experience is stiff, responsive and very comfortable.  A simple tap to the right of the shifter sends the car into sport mode and all 304 horses awaken to tear up the asphalt.  Only one way to describe our experience thus far- Pure Gold.","The exterior is stunning, but the interior is a major step up (even from BMW and Mercedes).  Driving at night and experiencing the ambiant lighting is worth the price of admission.  The Ultra View sunroof is a nice complement to the overall design.",Reaview mirrors should be a bit bigger.
4.875,Mac Daddy Pimp Mobile!,ejmachad ,09/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I picked up the ride on Saturday afternoon and spent the rest of the day ""oohing and aahing"" and getting lots of looks from other drivers.   I went from a BMW 325 and was very surprised by how well the car handled. I  expected a big drop off in handling and there was none.  Oh, and this car moves. I had smooth power and plenty of torque. If you're not careful, you'll eclipse the speed limit quickly. All this with an extremely quiet interior. The interior is beautiful--especially at night! The ambient lighting absolutely makes a huge impression. I like the HID steerable headlamps and if I'm not mistaken the back up lamps are HID as well.  This is my first Caddy and I'm in love! ",The built in Hard Drive roolz.  The 300W Bose stereo kicks.  DVD's in Dolby 5.1.  The remote start works from far away. When I get to my car it isn't 140F anymore!   The air conditioned seats means no more  shirts sticking to my back!  The stereo and NAV operate on verbal commands.  XM is great.  ,I expected the steering wheel and the gear shift knob to be wood.  No wood. Just leather.  Wood would have looked better.  Apparently there's supplier issues.  When the wood is available GM is not replacing them!  Gas mileage isn't too good yet either.

First trip was to Ann Arbor for dinner last night, beautiful ride!  ","Quiet, smooth acceleration, lots of driver comforts","Need somewhere to store the sun glasses other than the armrest console.  Sun shade under the glass roof is a little too opaque for me.  A little thicker material would do fine.  Did not get a chance to test drive the 300hp version, curious to see if there is a notable difference."
