4,Pontiac shouldn't have left us,Tom rauch ,12/30/2015,4,4,3,,,4,4,4,4,,,"After owning the car for about a year, I have gone through all 4 seasons. Spring, good. Summer, alright with the exception of the tranny running hot. Fall, good. Winte... now getting 2 feet of snow in a week, icy roads and a v8. I was nervous, but with stability control, abs, and traction control I found myself more relaxed through the winter then I thought I would be. This car has truly surprised me with it winter capabilities. I snowboard and so I need room for my gear, and also need to get up the mountain. This car has proved itself worthy. Now fuel economy for me is about 22 mpg, I drive 60 miles a day just for work and plus all of my running around is in this car. For a v8 and me having a heavy foot sometimes, I can't complain. Which brings me to my next point. This car is quiet, but if you open her up she has a growl that is just beautiful. Not to much and not to little.The interior is... Well the hud is nice, I love the seats, butt warmers, dual auto climate control, and dic. However the plastics rattle Alot. It is in my opinion the biggest down side to the car.I am aproaching 85k miles, and do regular maintenance, along with preventative maintenance, and have had no major issues yet.I am happy with this car so far after putting almost 20k miles on it and hope it keeps me that way.",,
4.625,Favorite Car,mike_ike ,06/13/2014,,,4,5,5,4,,5,4,5,5,"	I am writing this review on a 2008 Pontiac Grand Am that I own. I have owned this car for about two years and have only one bad thing to say about the car but other than that the car has been a great fit for me. I have owned the car for about five years. It has great gas mileage, great horsepower, it has needed only minimal repairs, and the only thing bad thing about it has been an issue with the ignition but that has been fixed. This is my first Pontiac I have bought and I donÂt regret the decision one bit. Every day I have to commute about 20 miles to work, so most of the miles I have put on my car are highway miles.My Pontiac gets around 30 miles per gallon on the highway.","the only issue I have had with this car has been that there was an ignition problem. I owned the car for about one year before the ignition problem occurred.
The issue was that when I would start the car and it would sometimes turn off right away. I took it to my local mechanic and he informed me that we just needed to put a new starter in and it would be as good as new. I have not had any other issues with the car anymore. This car has excellent horsepower and a great engine.
This car has excellent acceleration in town and on the highway.
I change the oil every 3,000 miles and have no problems with the engine. I love listening to the sound of the engine! This car has lasted a long time.","	The interior of this car has been great for me. I would prefer leather but the cloth interior has worked for me. The front two seats are bucket seats with a console with two cup holders in the middle. I am a tall guy and this car gives me more than enough room to stretch out my legs. I have taken this car on many long trips to different states and this car has been great. The back seat which is a bench seat is very comfortable but lacks in leg room a little.
The trunk is very spacious, as I said before I do a lot of traveling and the trunk gives me plenty of room for my suitcases and any extra things I need to bring along.

Lots of horsepower, love the heated leather seats, the tire pressure system has come in handy. Slight hum from the climate control motor (drives my wife nuts, doesn't bother me).

I test drove a gently used maxima, a tsx,and an IS 250. Liked them all. I test drove the GP GXP and was pleasantly surprised. The V8 power,options,and handling of this car far outperformed the others above. And it was ~ $8,000 less.  The car is not perfect. Fuel economy is not good and there are some cheap materials on the interior. There is torque steer due to front wheel drive but its not intolerable. But the performance and options you get for the value far outweighs the negatives. ",A blast to drive. Engine sounds awesome.  Great suspension. Great stereo system.,Poor fuel economy.

I am a little disappointed and depending on how many more problems I have, will depend on whether I keep this car or not. If this is all Pontiac has left, then it was time to retire. I have had power steering problems, constant issues with the brakes, wheel bearings have already been replaced and the car has under 50,000 miles.

I test drove a new G8, and was not impressed at all. The 2008 Grand Prix got a bad rap when they underrated it as just another carry over car that was ready to be put out to pasture,so to speak.

4.375,An Honest Review,stelo27 ,12/04/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"I had a 2006 Grand Prix GT V6 Supercharged and fell in love with it. I have always been a big Mazda fan growing up but had to switch to Pontiac after trading in my Mazda 6S for the 06 Grand Prix GT. I had it for 8 months and then sadly wrecked it. So i turned around and jumped right back into a 2008 Grand Prix, but the GXP this time. I love it. There is room for improvement, which i believe they have accomplished it in the new G8, But people, this is an awsome car. Especially for the price. I got mine slightly used with 9k miles on it, it MSRP for $29800, but being that its the last year for the Grand Prix and with the G8 now available, I got my GP GXP for $19000 and you can't beat that.","Powerfull realiable V8. Love the 303 Hp that can be modded with a chip and intake to 335 Hp. Beautiful comfortable seats. People knock the style but I love it, and it can be modded as well with chrome grille and trim. Gas is better than expected for the power. 5 year/ 100,000 mile power train warranty!","Should have been rear wheel for the power. Need more head room. Transmission work well, but 4 gears, come on! No contrast in color on center console, it needs some trim. Hood scoops would be nice. And basically every improvement I just listed, is on the new G8 plus another 60 horses. Good jop GM! "

It's comfortable, classy, and has get up & go when you want it to. Plenty of space too. Love the display that lets me know if the tire pressure is low and also the option to have OnStar makes me feel a little better driving in the snow in Michigan. I feel secure.

4.875,Excellent buy,LS ,11/09/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Grand Prix has always been one of the cars that I've liked, so i decided to give it a look wheni was in the market even though this was its last year. The drive is assurred, and fun, with ample power. i like the aggressive styling, and the quiet cabin. the interior is a tad bland, but everything else makes up for it. the drivers seat is nice and comfortable, and envelopes you in the seat. it feels like it has more than the 200 HP that it's rated at as its quick out the gate, and its mice to have the power when needed. Good MPG, in my first 1K I avg 23MPG in the city, which is excellent for a V6. bottom line, is that I think that  I've made the best decision, as this was a great value.","V6 power, great price for a 2008 certified vehicle, sporty drive, feel and look.","Last model year, but they could've put in an AUX input for an ipod.

Once I found out about all the standard equipment that the 2008 Grand Prix, I never looked back.  It has everything you need at a MSRP of $22,210.  Right now is a great time to consider this automobile. When I purchased my new Grand Prix on 8-8- 2008, Pontiac offered a great cash rebate or fair financing. Also, this is the last year of the Grand Prix.  Dealerships will definitely work with you on your final purchase price.

4.625,Surprisingly fun,Toyota Boy ,07/27/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"I rented this car for a week on Maui and was pleasantly surprised.  I've always liked the looks of the Grand Prix, and after sitting behind the wheel I really began to dig it.  It took a little getting used to the layout of the cabin but once I did, I found myself loving the feel of the car. Smooth power, great in the twisties (driving up& down the switchbacks to the Haleakala crater at 10,000 ft). The interior feels a little cheap but I'd only place it a little below the '08 Camry. Overall, I'd say this is a fun car for a good price and definitely worth a look if you're in the market for a sedan.","Handling in the twisties is very nice. The base 3.8 is strong & smooth especially from 20-60 but a little more power might be nice.  I love the fuel economy gauge - why don't all cars have this?  With plenty of stop & go and uphill driving, I averaged about 21 mpg- not bad!","Getting out of the rear seat can feel like a contortionist exercise. I'd make the trunk opening wider, too - did not feel like 16 cu ft.  A better turning radius would be welcome in tight parking lots.  RWD could be nice but the Grand Prix is so well composed that a 5-speed tranny is more important."

First of all the GXP V8 weighs less than the old 3.8 supercharged GTP and I have seen 0 - 60 in less than 6 seconds.  This car is a great blend of performance, fun, comfort and if driven correctly on the highway can get super mileage.  I have been averaging 29 mpg on the highway and can still punch it out from a red light and leave a nice cloud of smoke in the rear view mirror.  True to the G8 is a great performance car, but try driving it in the snow.  At least the GXP gives you the V8 push and still offers descent year round driving capabilities. Next time have your editor drive one.","Lot's of power, sweet exhaust note, European sports car and 1960's muscle car all rolled into one.","Shorter range 2nd and 3rd gears would have really helped this car.

I've owned many nice cars and todays economy has forced me to buy under 20,000.  For the money this car is perfect for average sized people, small families can benefit greatly.  I can't believe the gas mileage!  It rides like a silent hotrod if you will, but cost very minimal to operate.  Say what you want about the fancy technology inside, get extended warranty.
