4.625,3 mo after driving car - my impressions.,z0mb13 ,04/29/2012,,,5,5,4,4,,4,5,5,5,"So I finally jumped overboard and got the car ive always wanted. It put me in the hole but I was able to get it. Perma smile when driving is not uncommon. Much undesired attention from kids.Plenty of HP/TQ as expected. I had an 02 VR and fell in love with the exhaust note, the R32 has not let me down.","Seats, power, design, rear exhaust, nav system, exhaust, AWD. I could go on and on. 2 year VW certified warranty.",When stopped on a hill the DSG doesnt engage so I roll back then clunk into gear. Customer Service Fail. VWoA needs to hold the dealerships to the highest standars. This may be the only reason why I get rid of this car.
4.625,42K follow up,CA ,06/13/2010,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,3,5,Follow up from Sep 2008 when I bought it w/ 12k miles.  I now have 42k on this car and it remains rock solid. Over time I've gotten very used to getting the most out of it without killing gas mileage. It's best on long twisty road and takes 20 mph S-turns at 60-70 mph w/o even thinking about it and is so much fun to drive.  I  get 23 combined and 26 highway MPG but still think it needs a taller 6th gear.  It's hard to find a better AWD car. AWD and DSG maintenance is spendy and only had a strut go bad. With all that said I wonder what it would do with an additional 100 hp. ,"Engine, Torque, Interior Styling, ride, DSG is quick in sport and triptronic","Nav, Ipod, Bluetooth, paddle shifters are hard to reach during turns. Fog lamps,  What it could do with 350 HP?"
3.625,From BMW to R32 and Back,crooner12 ,05/11/2010,,,3,4,4,4,,4,4,2,4,"I purchased a 2008 R32 back in January. It was a great little car, had good performance thanks to the AWD, and sounded magnificent with the dual exhaust. Coming from an '06 Z4 3.0i, it was a totally different experience. Not as luxurious and not has sporty handling, but it felt just as fast. Ultimately, I missed the convertible and didn't think the ""boy-racer"" styling fit my personality, so I traded it in for a BMW 135i convertible.","The exhaust note was AMAZING! For being stock, it easily had the best sounding exhaust of any non-V8 car south of $60K. The AWD was nice too, especially in putting the power down out of a turn.","Fuel economy really suffered with the super short gearing. I'd be turning over 3K rpm in 6th gear. Also, the DSG was a little clunky at low speeds and from a stop. Weight really hurt the car performance wise. Also, the gas tank could be a bit larger to help the range."
3.125,Real recalls,Echo346 ,12/30/2009,,,4,5,1,1,,4,4,2,4,"After a year and a half this vehicle has had THREE major recalls. One required dropping the entire fuel tank (read nightmares involved with this on VW forums).  I will not go into my adventure with this except to say VW service is questionable.  Now the DSG transmission (mine is starting get ""clunky"") just got the latest recall. Be careful when buying a used one. Ergonomics are strange.  AUX input in glove box, Bluetooth controls on steering wheel, however, Bluetooth is not an option (dealer will not tell you this unfortunately), cruise control is a switch on turn indicator (should have put it where the worthless phone button is on the steering wheel), paddle shifters are small. ","Styling, F1 shaped steering wheel are fantastic and the double clutch was awesome until time starts to catch up with it (just to many little gears in a sub 35000 car).  AWD, brakes and handling great for such a heavy car. Lots of space with back seats down and one of the best exhaust notes ever.","You will average about 18 MPG if you drive this car like you want to. Service is incredibly expensive and VW dealerships are unreliable. Recalls (and follow through) ruin any fun you can have with this car.  An incredible headache for a ""limited edition"" vehicle."
4.875,R32 Senior,JoneR32 ,12/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Was researching for a sports sedan/coupe with AWD, stability control, full air bags & side curtains, and being reviewed as quite respectable in the performance, safety, and handling categories-- safety being first.  I found a certified low mileage [6650] R32 in Naples, FL via Autotrader and negotiated a price over the phone-- $23900 + tax & title.  Have since added 8000 miles, and they were all driven with a smile on my face.  The R32 is a great daily ""sports"" driver, esp. in city traffic due to the excellent DSG tranny which is left in auto 100% of the time, per the tests that one can't shift as fast as this tranny in manual mode/paddle shifter or console.  21.5 MPG overall--26+ MPG hwy.",DSG tranny--invented by VW; excellent fit & finish; muffler tone via the short-bank 3.2L V6 engine; heated seats w/ 1--5 heat range; center console adjustable arm rest; good passenger rear space; red night dash lights; auto-load adjustable HID lights w/ DRL controls; turn signals in side mirrors.,"To improve the long-drive, 2HR + ,hardness in driver seat rear bottom, possibly due to heat elements [Cadillac CRT had same problem, and corrected it].

4.75,Still Great at 25K Miles,J D Sharp ,06/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I wrote about my car shortly after receiving it in 2007. Here we are nearly two years later, and I still love it. No mechanical problems at all. Gas mileage is still mediocre (25mpg at very best, all highway driving, more like 18 in the city . . .) but understandable when there's so much power on tap. Seats continue to be completely supportive even after two years. Just wanted to chime in and say that the enthusiastic glow that so many of us feel right after buying a car has continued with this one. My favorite car I have ever owned, and that includes a long string of Audis, BMWs and various Japanese makes. No regrets whatever.",DSG is a complete winner. Great seats. Rain Sensing wipers. Automatic climate control with DUAL button so you can only adjust one set of controls if you want. Oversize brakes. All wheel drive provides much better balance and cornering than the comparable GTI.,"Taller sixth gear, or better yet, add a seventh with true overdrive. Too many revs at 80 MPH (which of course I never drive, since that would exceed the speed limit.)"
4.5,Total sleeper!,Bio Two ,03/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,3,5,"I tested both GTI then the R32 on the same raod and same driving style. If it was not the price tag, it will be a no brianer R32 is the one. I picked the R32 anyway. This car is super fun to drive. After getting used to the car and start pushing it, I was shocked that how much a $33000 car can do! Especially on wet road, this car car pretty much beat any moving object on the road! If you can totally master this car, you can out run most of the higher power cars on the market even with the only 250bhp. I often play with my co-worker's BMW 335i, as long as there are some turns, he will has a hard time to catch up. The sweetest feature... Lanch Control!!","AWD, DSG, Lanch Control.","Navigation, full power seats, more power. Well...ok better gas mileage."
4.125,A TON of Fun!,travelingman ,01/03/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,5,"I bought my blue R32 (with nav) in April and drive 85 miles a day to work. This car is a great commuting car; fun to drive, comfortable ride but a ton of torque at any speed. I have had an Audi S4 and S6 and neither is as fun as this car. The only two things that I have added to the car is a clear bra and a Parrot blue tooth system that integrates directly to to the phone button on the steering wheel. It works wonderfully with my iphone 3G. ","Great Exhaust note, good power, comfortable ride. I have had VW buffs to a guy in a MB 350 AMG come up to me and tell me how they love this car.

4.875,The Perfect Hatch!,Phikes ,11/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Buy this car! The build quality is in Audi territory. The interior is great (steering wheel feels fantastic in hand). The car has grip for days, the body might roll a bit but the AWD goes exactly where you want it. Not to mention one of the best shades of blue ever. And yes it is FAST!  The mid range passing power is always right there. I drove both the STI and EVO, they are both faster, but that's the ONLY place they beat the R32. Both the STI and EVO have interior build quality that suggests the occupants were only an after thought.",Yes the exhaust note is a good as you keep hearing about! Exclutivity. Good MPG considering 250hp & AWD. DSG is golden.,Minor stuff: Bluetooth. Ipod adapter for non-nav models. Aluminum :R dead plate for left foot. The 3.6l V6 would dominate. ;)
4.875,Fun car!,604doc ,11/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car wasn't even a consideration for me until a friend told me about it. I fell in love with the car on the test drive.

4.75,"The Ultimate ""Grown Up"" Pocket Rocket",Tony ,11/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I have been wanting this car ever since it hit our shores at the end of 07, however, I didn't want to pay sticker (or more) simply b/c it was a limited edition vehicle. Ended up paying $29K for my new non nav R32. I love the styling, DSG & all wheel drive grip of the Haldex 4motion system. This car really offers the best of the ""boy racer"" fun, but yet the practicality of a 3 dr hatchback without all the hood scoops and large winged spoilers.  The fuel economy is the only real negative; and it's not the 18 mpg in the city that bothers me, its the short cruising range of 225 to 270 mls; the answer would have been a bigger tank. Otherwise no complaints; it's a great car that I would recommend.","3.2 VR6, DSG transmission (best of both worlds), exterior/interior styling, grip in the corners, all weather capabilities, pick up, incredible sport seats, useful cargo area, GREAT exhaust note",short cruising range; needs a larger gas tank
4.5,Worth the Wait,jn ,09/08/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I was set on buying a GTI until i found a dealer that was selling their last 2 R32s for $4K below the list price (including the VW rebate) instead of $4K over like my local VW dealer.  I ended up paying $29.3K (without Nav.) which is only about $3-4K more that an optioned up GTI.  So far the car has lived up to its billing.  The power is more than adequate for in town driving, the handling is great and the exhaust note is pure magic. The gas mileage is even acceptable as long as you keep your foot out of it. It was the Reader's Reviews on Edmunds that convinced me to got for it and i have not been disappointed.","semi sleeper looks, comfortable interior,  all wheel drive handling, exhaust note, DSG, BiXenon HID Headlights","Bluetooth, Driving/ Fog lights"
4.75,Solid,CA ,09/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Bought this R32 used with 12k miles.  It is everything that I thought it would be.  Solid build, handling, acceleration.  DSG is surprisingly quick and responsive.  23 MPG mixed so far but am surprised at the amount of revs in top gear.  This engine could easily handle a taller gear and would probably get better gas mileage.  Unlike others, I think this vehicle is exactly what it was made to be and  should be.

3.875,Gas Line Problems,Chris ,07/18/2008,,,4,5,3,3,,5,4,2,5,"I too love this vehicle.  It is sporty, functional, and fairly comfortable.  However, as some of you have mentioned, I too have had this gas tank problem.  My R32 was idling when it just started dumping multiple gallons of gas everywhere.  The tank wasn't full and it came from the underside of the car.  The VW people assure me that this problem was unique to my car.  However, all the parts are back ordered.  The have had my car for almost 2 weeks and said it could be 2-3 weeks more.  Sounds like VW needs to admit this design flaw.","Exhaust note, DSG, 4 wheel drive, turns heads!","Fix fuel tank.  Put decent speakers in this $33,000 car.  Add the Audi LED lights to it, put the ipod connector in a reasonable place (near power).  Don't make customers wait 2 weeks for parts."

However I had no idea how smooth and precise the DSG was until my  First Road Trip - from Detroit to Atlanta (750 miles).  I learned that ""S"" means See Ya later!  I was comfortable and enjoy the drive. Unbelievable handling and acceleration! This vehicle is low key and stays under the ""Radar"" with police.

It has all the safety option you need: ABS, AWD, 6 airbags, ESP, seat belt pretensioners, and the list goes on and on. The build and quality in unsurpassed.  The AWD and the VR rated tires make this a great handling car.  The interior is plush and well thought out.

I do have to say the R32 doesn't quite hit the handling and performance of some of these cars, but it does something none of them could do (with the exception of the 97 M3) and that is provide performance and practicality.  It certainly beats the M3 in bad weather because of AWD, but in pure head banging acceleration, you won't get it with the R32.  What you will get is manners, knowing that the car in under your control, not the other way around, which happens when people buy too much car for their capability.

The car stalled on them 3 times on testing. It ended up being the fuel canister (it was soaked), and was replaced. I was given a rental car. I am now experiencing the same problem, and will be taking the car back to the dealer this week (4/18/08), for what I suspect is the same problem. Has anyone else had this problem w/ their 2008 R32?

4.875,Just got mine and I'm loving it.,DeepClue ,11/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Amazing car. I take my 4-yo daughter to school every day and I was skeptical about the two doors, but I find it actually more comfortable stepping in from the driver's door right in front of her than doing the side fumbling through the rear door in my (now traded in) Jetta.","AWD is incredibly sharp compared to the Jetta's FWD. 3.2L engine gets the car going fast effortlessly, without screaming like the 1.8T did. The car is beautiful (got the blue). Xenon headlights are sophisticated and amazing. DSG in D (auto) mode is actually quite good.","No iPod adapter, but VW sells it as an aftermarket piece for $133 plus installation. No Monster mats (again, can buy for $75). No metal door sills. No aluminum dead pedal. All really minor things."
5,R32 Great Car,Javier ,10/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is amazing! Even the DSG has convinced me completely. Of course it is not the same and you need to go through a learning curve, but once cleared, it is amazing!  The grip is outstanding, the steering is precise, comfortable, transmits enough info. It feels faster than the official numbers from VW. Love engine sound! I specially enjoy the ""stealthiness"" that you get with this car, perfect for a business meeting. In addition I do not get people trying to race me every light, but when it happens they really get surprised by the car performance.  Cool car.","Fast enough to surprise everyone!! Discrete, good for professional life, you will be taken seriously. Very unique car!!","One can live with more Bhps that is for sure. Fuel consumption  could be better, however I do not complain, I knew this in advance!!"
4.625,VW hits a home run,J D Sharp ,09/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"This replaced a 3.2 Audi TT quattro. Same basic running gear, but it has all been so much more refined. DSG no longer grabs as if you'd popped the clutch when you tip in too quickly. Power is seemingly endless and always on tap. DSG continues to be the miracle transmission; no regrets and no need for manual even though I have driven shift for years. The dividing line between Audi and VW is fluff, things like, tipping-down mirrors, homelink and such, luxury features. This car is more elemental and more to my liking because of it. Just completed a 2K roadtrip and have no complaints!","Amazing power. Smooth fast transmission. Totally supportive seats with power four-way back bolster. Nice sound system. Sunroof with a real sliding shade, not mesh. Great cargo capacity with seats down. Simple clean interior. Cruise control with minimal buttons. Simply a great package!","Mediocre gas mileage which could be greatly improved with a taller top gear. However, mileage is slowly increasing as the car breaks in - many VW/Audi engines continue to break in, to some degree, all the way to 20K. Homelink would be nice. Maybe a wood strip instead of aluminum."
5,The .:R is back and better than ever!,Dr. A. Keller ,09/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The new R32 may not be as rugged as the previous-gen R32, but it definitely feels a bit more refined with a stiffer chassis, precise handling, more upscale interior material, more comfort features, etc.; all while still retaining its crown as the ultimate hot hatch!  The VR6 has a very nice grunt from all around the rev band and is a perfect match with the DSG's lighting fast, crisp gear changes. You can definitely feel the VR6 open up with the more miles you put it through. It feels MUCH more aggressive now (1200 + miles) than it did when I picked her up with 12 miles.  If I can describe the R32 in a few short words: it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.","Interior ergonomics is very simple/straightforward, DSG is better than ever, VR6 meaty growl, sporty brakes, Deep Blue Pearl finish, centered twin-exhaust, etc.","Nav system needs to be updated, i.e. touch-screen, integrated Bluetooth, etc."
3.875,"Super special Golf, regular build quality",canyondrive ,08/29/2007,,,3,4,4,4,,5,4,2,5,"In the price range of new c300, 328i,G35 and is350, this car is truly for the VW enthusiast who doesn't mind paying a lot. You get a great sounding engine (thank you VW engneeer!), transmission, semi-sleeper styling, more than enough power for non-racers. But this is basically a golf, which first came to EU in 2003. Especially the interior is feeling a bit old already (shame on VWoA for being so slow). This has been my second day with the car, and I already started to hear interior pieces rattle on rough roads. Stereo sounds ok until you crank up the base - then it sound like some economy speakers.  ","3.2+DSG is a great combination, works a lot smoother in slow traffic compared to 2.0t. Great sounding engine and muffler. It roars! ",Better speakers for over 30k vehicle. I can't tell the diff the sound quality between 1.4 (EU) and R32's speaker. 5 door is better than 3 door (practical!).
4.5,Performance Car - Make Sure You're Ready,V ,08/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,2,5,"Coming from an 06 GTI, I am not sure if I should have moved to an R32.  It has everything the enthusiasts want - incredible road grip, throaty exhaust, V6 power, and AWD.  But, the zip (even with lag) of the GTI's 2.0T was great for me.  The premium price for the exclusivity of owning one of 5,000 is a bitter pill to swallow, but the car does everything the manufacturer promises and more.   Because of the power and AWD, the car literally sucks gas.  I feel like I am driving an SUV when I have a compact car.  Mileage has been about 19-20 in mixed driving.  My GTI pulled at least 27 mpg.","Exhaust sound, limited option selections (practically sold as loaded), handling (can turn on a dime and great accident avoidance), white and blue illumination for the gauges.","Metal dead pedal like the GTI, fog lamps like the GTI, available Dynaudio, something to distinguish the seats from the GTI like blue stitching and an embroidered R instead of the pressed R and better gas mileage."
4.875,New R32? HOT!!,Nate Adams ,08/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just three days in and I am absolutely sure that this is best purchase in 27 yrs! We have had an 03 Jetta, and currently have an 06 Passat. I had bought a GTI in Feb but couldn't resist the all-wheel drive. But that is nothing compared to what I felt and heard out of that tailpipe! Deep, soothing sounds that send chills up your spine! Sport and luxury all at once? Great job VW. Just give us a manual next time please!","Exhaust, all-wheel drive. Did I say exhaust?",Manual transmission and a few more horses. Just 10 hp more than the 04 model.
4,Blue 08 R32,JRP ,08/19/2007,,,5,4,4,3,,4,4,3,5,"If slot cars could be full scale this might be it.  Steering is right on, just point where you want it to go.  Suspension is firm but does not beat you up.  Transmission is a blast with the engine being eager all the time.  Relaxed when you want it to be, fun when you need it to be.  Roomier inside than you'd think.  ",Steering accuracy and feedback.  Engine smoothness.  Transmission.  Muscular looks without a bunch of warmed over skirt plastic.,Little more power with more spread of the gears.  Better gas mileage??
5,R32 #939,HSE ,08/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Currently, I have no CDs in the CD changer, no iPod connected and Sirius radio has yet to be activated - the exhaust note and engine resonance are (simply put) addicting!  The motor has a lot of grunt. It has a good amount of low end torque and, once the horsepower catches up, it just keeps pulling and pulling! The AWD Haldex system is great. It doesn't struggle one bit - just tight, neutral handling.  VR6 + DSG mate extremely well. Fast AND smooth; how do they do it??  The interior design and ergonomics are top notch. There's a very thin line between VW and Audi nowadays!  What can I say about the exterior? It's gorgeous. Very upscale/mature, but you can tell it wants to play.","Exclusive Deep Blue Pearl paint with matching brake calipers, white/blue illuminating gauges, very happy with audio and A/C controls - very straight forward, the sweet sound (music to my ears) of that VR6, great handling, DSG, limited run.","3.6L motor, nav system that isn't years behind the rest, more interior features that separate the R32 from the GTI, i.e. seats!"
4.375,First few weeks with the '08 R32,Mark L ,08/16/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,3,5,"First off, I am a 43 year old fun car junkie with a family.  The Corvette has to wait till the kids leave.  This is one cool car in the meantime.  Looks different, lots of fun to drive.  Not as fast as an EVO or STI, but so much more upscale and solid, still plenty fast enough though.  My first AWD car, I have had both FWD and RWD, don't like FWD, like RWD, and now I also really like AWD.  I have always owned a standard manual transmission so the DSG was an experiment, very very cool, I may never go back.  Extremely linear power delivery, sounds cool while doing it to.  Only have a few tanks on it so far, gas mileage is about 19 in mixed driving and no abuse since it's still not broken in.","The DSG is the best.  Lots of nice little details in the feature department.  Great blue/white/red dash lighting.  Very nice steering wheel.  Nice linear power. Great sound. Did I mention the awesome tranny, who needs a clutch pedal.",Gas mileage is only so-so so far.  Center console can be intrusive to my lower right leg (I'm 6 feet tall) but legroom is great.  Car should have an intelligent key and pushbutton start for the price.  Not sure about the audio aux jack location in the glovebox.
5,Super Car!,STEVE C ,08/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"It took a long time coming, but I finally found a car that was fun to drive with style, luxury and enough speed to keep my heart racing. Audi, BMW, Mercedes have nothing on this car. Saved 15k over BMW and got way better quality car.","Speed, speed, speed, launch control awesome.",Nav to be easier to use.
4.75,R32 #2,KingfisherSeattle ,08/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,Just picked up my Mk V R32 today! This is my second as I had an Mk IV since new in 04. 20k miles later I'm ready for my new car. A lot more refinement and still that great VR6 motor. Worth the extra money over the 2.0T motor for the sound alone. Road trip to PDX tomorrow (with the radar detector). ,"VR6 motor, DSG transmission, HID headlights, growl of the motor!",3.6 motor. 5 door body shell vs the 3 door. European Recaros vs the GTI seats.
