5,Love my Scion xD!!!,Austin ,01/07/2016,4,3,4,,,5,5,4,4,,,"I was in the market for a fuel efficient vehicle with a college student budget. I had looked at several popular cars (Corolla, Civic, Impreza, etc) and hadn't thought about Scion. I caught sight of it on a used car lot and before I knew it I was signing the papers. The xD is a reasonably priced car that has great fuel economy. I typically will get about 28-32 around town and 32-36 on the highway. This car has excellent visibility and handles really well on the road. It doesn't accelerate as quickly as I would like, but it's not bad for a four cylinder. I love how much legroom/headroom there is inside-and not just in the front, but as well as the backseat. The back seats fold flat creating a large cargo space, but even with the seats up there is plenty of cargo space. Easy to park, low maintenance cost, extra compartments, plenty of cupholders, the list just goes on. For such an affordable price, it has a lot to offer. The driver seat does not rise/lower which could be an issue for some drivers but the steering wheel can be adjusted. The speedometer/tachometer takes some getting used to as it is sideways-it took me a little while to adjust. Overall I have been pleasantly surprised with my Scion xD and I think I might keep it around for awhile.",,
4.875,Loved This Car,mcgooey ,06/11/2012,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"This was my first brand new car. I stumbled upon this car when it first came out. I think I just got lucky with it. didnt know anything about the car but i had been wonderfully happy with this car. it was fun, sporty. had some get up and go. and there were alot of customizable features that you could add to the car. radio was great. love the ipod hook up feature. I was able to get 40 highway and high 20's city. this car was the love of my life. unfortunately it got squished in between a ford f150 and a ford E150. The car actually held up alot better in the accident then I would have expected from the impact, but the car was a total loss. RIP scion XD","stereo was awesome, handling was great. Sporty look, interior was fun also

3.5,"OK, not great.  ",whitewolfe001 ,11/05/2011,,,3,5,3,4,,3,3,4,3,"I bought the car used at 44k miles. The dealer put on brand new tires, and yet, the car is HORRIBLE in snow!The tires spin/slide not only on a mere coating of snow, but something even on wet roads.It's not a small car problem, because my old Geo Prizm was a champ in snow, and my fiance's Nissan Versa is also quite good.I'm going to have to get winter tires, even though I live 1.5 flat miles from work, because frankly I don't feel safe driving this in any amount of snow.Otherwise, it's OK.The handling is not great.It has a very poor turning radius for a small car, and it's herky-jerky: the gas and brake pedals are too sensitive; it takes quite a lot of finesse to drive smoothly.","I was in a hurry to get a car because my previous car failed safety inspection, and I admit I bought the Scion mostly because it was cute.
It's cute all right.
That's about all I can say about its good features.
It's been reliable, sure... it starts.
It's OK on gas but not as good as I expected for such a small car.
I get 30 miles to the gallon city in the summer if I drive super carefully, but only 27-28 city in the winter when they change the fuel mix (I'm in New England.)
My V6 Pontiac Grand Prix got 21-22, so this is not a great improvement in gas mileage for such a reduction in driving enjoyment. ","There are weird front end noises that no one can diagnose.
I prefer automatic daytime running lights for safety, and to ensure I don't accidentally leave the headlights on, although it does warn you if you try.
It's herky-jerky:
the gas and brake pedals are TOO sensitive, not a smooth ride.
There's a lot of engine/road noise.
The aerodynamics are messed up; you can't just open a front window or you'll get a weird interior air vibration (my fiances Nissan Versa does this also).
You have to crack a back window also to avoid the weird weird tunnel buzz.

First off the tires are not great on it.It slides all over the road, rain and snow. I did however find winter tires this year and it went much better, but the cost was high ($600). Driving on the highway is horrible because any little bit of wind and it blows you all over the road. Also when driving with just the front windows down is impossible, it makes a wind tunnel effect and is a killer on your ears, so the back windows have to be down too. I also replaced the charcoal canister twice in it, which happened at 38,000 miles. $1,000+ each time replaced. Not the vehicle I expected.","plug in for ipod, room to hull stuff when the back seats are folded down","It'd be nice if tires were easier to find, and cheaper. "

But there are only 2 manufacturers who make a tire for this car. Both are garbage. So what good is reliability, fuel efficiency, etc. if the tires are failing? New tires (Dunlop) were $600 at dealer cost. Wheel bearing went out on my XA at 32K, so I have that to look forward to next! GM parts used on these cars, so this is to be expected.",,
4,"Compact, fuel efficient and great value.",agalcowa ,01/24/2011,,,3,4,4,4,,4,4,5,4,"I stumbled upon the Scion Xd while looking for a Honda Civic and Mazda 3. The Scion is most different from the Mazda, but is similar to the Civic in the following ways: reliability, fuel efficiency, and compact size. The car is decently built for a compact car. It shares many components from the Toyota Corolla (engine, tranny, etc) and knobs and other items from the Rav4. For any 4-cylinder car that doesn't have a turbo, I recommend the manual for better control and performance, especially when merging onto the freeway. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my Scion and glad that I found it. ","Fuel economy (I average 30 in the city and 38 on the highway), I find the driver's seat pretty comfortable and I'm 6'3"". This isn't the type of car I would call amazing, but for my daily commuter it's more than I could ask for. ","The biggest downside of the Scion Xd is the road noise - the engine sound and road noise is louder than I prefer. I plan on keeping the car for a while, so I'm going to install some Dynamat which should reduce the noise substantially. I wouldn't have purchased a Civic or Mazda because of the noise though. "

So far, I love it! Fun to drive, fantastic fuel economy, solid build quality--I can't understand why these aren't more popular.It has more life than the Versa, Yaris or Matrix, and feels more solid on the highway than the Fit.  Okay, I will concede the car's one major flaw--it is most comfortable for shorter drivers. But to me, that's a plus compared to my old tC where I could barely see over the doors! Still, with a seat height adjuster or telescoping steering wheel, the xD would cater to more people.",Tremendous pick-up and braking ability for a high MPG car.

I've have a few problems with it, transmission slips every one and awhile in the cold, ABS and EBrake lights keep coming on. However, I have done quite a bit of research and neither seems to be a common problem so I'm thinking I just got a bad one.  The gas mileage is amazing, 35-45 in the summer, I have even had it to 50 on long road trips. The winter is a little lower averaging 30 mpg city/highway mix.",Love the fold down seats and the hatch back. I got the standard radio and it sounds pretty good. ,"Change the gauges, I would like to be able to see the engine temp and a gas gauge instead of just dummy lights.

I also needed good cargo capacity and excellent gas mileage.  It has proven itself on all counts.  The red color is very easy to spot among all the silver cars in big parking lots. I also keep the rear seat down for hauling cargo; mostly golf clubs and groceries.","Gas mileage: 34 city, 40 highway during summer drops to 30/36 during winter.  Comfortable drivers seat.

Many people compare this to Honda Fit, which I think is not the right comparison due the techinal specs to start with and also road drive pleasure in this is great.

On the freeway I'm doing 80 without realizing it. In the beginning gasoline would splash back out at every fill up. It took two visits to the same dealership to get the problem fixed. My description was not adequate so the second time the service manager hopped in and we went to a gas station and he saw it happen.,Radio controls on the steering wheel is my number one favorite feature. I got the optional armrest which enhances my comfort. Very happy with the optional cargo liner that my two dogs trample on. I also like the window closing feature when the key has already been taken out of the ignition.,I could really use a sixth gear and wish the gear I'm in would be displayed on the dash. I would have liked a sunroof (almost went with the Tc). I like the rear windows partially open but the sound it produces is almost unbearable.

It took a little getting used to the change in size, but overall, this has been a great choice in vehicle! I mostly drive in town, but occasionally get on the highway. I find I get decent mileage in town and excellent mileage on the open road. The car defies the laws of physics. It is very comfortable for even large people and can hold a LOT more cargo than it looks. I love how I can whip in and out of parking spots easily, or slip into the next lane of traffic without cutting off the guy behind me. Overall, it's been a great car to drive and the money I save on gasoline is a dream!","I just got the standard stereo w/the ipod jack and it's been great. Plenty of cup holders, and I love how the back seats slide forward and recline, which makes installing a child car seat easy. ","Armrest for the driver's seat on the right would be good. Since there is an ipod jack, a dedicated spot for it (other than a cup holder) would be great. A sunroof would be a fun option!"
5,Car & Driver,Ancron ,11/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Having been driving a 1995 Honda Civic CX Hatchback for the last 10 Years, this was definitely different! After studying Hondas and Toyotas I had it in my mind to either buy a Corola or a Civic (Both have exceptional Engines that last for quite a long time!). Determined to go to the Honda dealership and the Toyota dealership before I actually buy.  My first stop was at the Toyota dealership. After the salesman showed me a few corolas on sale then he showed me a Scion XD.  Having no idea about Scions (At the time I didn't know they were toyotas, I just thought they were another cheap brand), he explained in detail about the scion brand. After test driving the Scion and Corola, I bought the XD.","Love the Hatch back and room, my Honda was a hatchback and I actually marveled on how much stuff I could actually haul in it! Good handling and good enough power for a car that gets about 30+ MPG.  Love all the extras (Power locks, windows, AC, etc), remember, my last car had manual everything!","The tinting is just right, didn't buy the car to go 180 MPH. Might possibly get some rims at a later time. Lucky my car came with the optional rear spoiler, floor mats, upgraded stereo."

I just took a trip and managed 42 mpg on the highway while around town I'm getting about 32 mpg.  It has some power if you get on it but the manual transmission is awful.  The Interior is awesome as well as the body design, and people are always checking it out on the street. ","Overall design. Seating is super-comfortable on long trips (for me). I'm 5' 11"" and about 180 lbs and it fits me perfectly. Also, the room for cargo is very good. I can pack stuff into this.","Manual transmission needs to be better. Shifting is clunky. I stall out from a dead stop at least 2 or 3 times a day. Either the flywheel needs to be larger, or it needs more torque."
5,Surprisingly fun and inexpensive car,Carl ,11/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought this guy a couple of months ago as an all-around hauler. I drive about 75 miles a day for work, was looking for practicality and fun. Also use on weekends for trips to see our daughter at college, etc. Very pleased with the xD. Lowered with TRD springs from dealer, rear spoiler, bumper protector. Have not used for overnight trip, but hauls four adults with ease (we are all short) and occasionally five for trips around town. Looked also at the Honda Fit, also nice, but glad I chose the xD. 33-36 miles per gallon (measured at fill-ups), 35-39 average on readout. Ride (w/TRD springs) is firm but comfortable.

4.75,Six months later.,Pleased Consumer ,10/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I purchased the xD in March 2008, and have six months experience driving it. Fuel economy has been a steady 34 mpg, calculated.  I have had only one incident where the Vehicle Stabilization Control system automatically worked its magic. It was during a highway run, climbing a hill during a rainstorm when traction was especially bad. The system kicked in at a time when I was unaware that I was losing traction. I maintained control with its aid, slowed down,and carried on with my trip all smoothly, safely done. This VSC is a  worthwhile feature. One slight but nagging shortfall in the design of this car is the FEEL of the brakes-- they operate well, but are vague in their feel.","The features themselves, their number and convenience. This is a nice package for the price, a wonderful small car. I like its homely looks, too.","Improve the FEEL of the brakes, Toyota. They need not actuate abruptly, just not so tentatively when first applied. This is the only area where my previous car excelled this one-- brake feel feedback."

I wanted a vehicle that I could put stuff in the back of (home depot trips, etc.).  Unfortunately, gas shot up to like $4 a gallon that day so I got rid of the SUV idea.  After a lot of researching and reviewing, i went with the xD for its gas mileage, fold- down back seats (my friend and I can finagle our mountain bikes in there and trips to home depot are no problem), a low price tag, and the Toyota built engine.  I've had the car about 6 months now and i couldn't be happier.  It's definitely got some pep to it when you hit the gas, too.  Good for light stuff, just don't expect to do any heavy hauling.  ","Fold-down back seats, gas mileage, reliable, ballsy for a small car, lots of cup holders!, and lots of options to customize it when you buy it and a hell of a lot of aftermarket parts.  Oh and it's got a good amount of space: I'm 6', 245 lbs and I feel really comfortable driving it. ","It'd be nice to squeeze a little more MPG out of it.  If i take it easy for a week I'll get 33 mpg; if i really hammer it, 26 mpg; on average, 29 mpg.    "
4.5,Scion xD Good Choice,wendy ,10/18/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,5,4,"Overall I am completely satisfied with my Scion xD. I purchased a 2008 xD in May 2008 because I commute 140 miles round trip. The xD has all the air bags, ABS and cruise control standard unlike some other small cars I looked at (Toyota Yaris, Honda Fit). My commute is half open freeway and half stop and go freeway. My fuel efficiency averages 35 MPG during the summer with the AC on all the time. I expect it to go up in the fall and winter. The xD is comfortable although the seats could be a little cushier. I think the gauges are well placed. Not having an arm rest doesn't bother me. Main drawback is blocking the sun from the door window.

We bought it because of the look, the navigation system, but mostly because of the ""expected"" great fuel economy.  I don't have much to say about the design besides that there should be an arm rest and it is crazy that the nav system doesn't allow you to use some of the options when the car is moving.  The only real disappointment is the gas mileage.  I read many reviews that stated 30+ and much more on trips.  We have never seen anything better than 26-27/gallon city or highway or some combination.

Good thing, too. A guy in a stolen car ran me off the road and into the concrete median in the middle of the hwy going about 65 mph, and I walked away with a sprained wrists and burns/scrapes from the seat belt and airbags.

I drive 150 miles a day to/from work so I log a lot of miles quickly.  I am now up to 11,800 miles and have not had a problem.  It is comfortable and roomy for 4 adults.

It's different and you almost never see another one on the road, i average 37- 40 mpg depending on where I'm driving, it's extremely easy to move in and out of traffic due to its small design, and its extremely safe crash test ratings and standard side airbags set my mind at ease.

I test drove everything in this type (Nissan Versa, Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Kia Rio 5, etc...), felt this was easily the best of hte bunch.

Looked at the matrix but couldn't figure out what we were actually getting for the cost.  My wife test drove both and loved the Xd.  The test drive combined with all the standard options and the price of the Xd made it a no brainer for us over the matrix.  We enjoy driving it, its no sports car but the power to MPG factor is better than expected.  At 6 feet tall, I find it just a bit short on leg room but overall very comfortable.  The bottom line is that for a great price we have a highly fuel efficient vehicle that looks good, is fun to drive, and loaded with creature comforts.  Hated to give up the 4 runner but love what we got in return.","Price-feeling like we really got something for the money. MPG-- we can get 34 or better with the AC on and at top interstate speeds.  The standard features including good stereo, MPG and other displays, 5 speed manual, cruise, etc.  Finally, given all this, it just feels good to drive it.

Everything feels like quality on the Scion, unlike with the Ford Focus that it's replacing.  I also love the firmness of the seats.

Went and took it out for a test drive and was amazed at the power it put out for being a 1.8L. I was also amazed at the leg room that it had because I read reviews saying it was small for those with long legs. At 6ft tall I had plenty of room, and I haven't even pushed it back all the way. Overall with options and everything, no other car can compete. Did I mentioned it came with a first aid kit lol.","It's a great car to drive around, the look is different and unique.

It's much more stylish than the Fit, has the great option of vehicle stability control.  And the safety features were a big seller for me, as I plan to have children in the next few years.  Overall, this car is even better than I expected.  It handles extremely well and is quite fun to drive.  The radio/CD/iPOD controls on the steering wheel makes it easy to listen to the music you want.  There is a lot of room in this little vehicle, and the engine has quite a bit of pick-up.

I still use a rear-facing car seat for my baby and it actually fits better in the back seat of the Scion than it did in the Volvo. I think it has as much to do with the shape of the dashboard as it does with the roominess of the back seat, but whatever the reason, the front passenger is always glad not have knees jammed up against the dashboard. Because the xD is tall with a high seating position, downsizing from an SUV was not nearly the adjustment I thought it would be.","All the features that come standard: steering wheel controls, iPod jack, rear wiper.

I drive fast on the freeway and in traffic and this car is as stated, feels more substantial, less darty, more powerful. Inside the console is ergonomic, there are a lot more standard features and I am 5'10"" 200 lbs and no problem with room.

I have had people quiz me about it and everyone loves it.  Why doesn't Scion push this vehicle?  When I tell people I have an Xd they assume it is an Xb. Nobody has heard of it.

It really is a fun car to drive. Very happy. GOOD JOB TOYOTA!!!...:) ","The handling, the dash layout is nice and the interior is sporty. The touches and design on the exterior are sharp. I like the exterior light configuration and the turn signals incorporated in the mirrors is cool. Plenty of power and great MPG!!!","The stereo system could use a little pep, but it gets the job done. One more 12V Auxiliary Plug. A water & electric gauge.

At first I didn't even think much about looking at the Scion brand because it is marketed to younger people and I am a middle age mom.  With my BMW I became concerned about gas mileage and upkeep costs.  When it was time to trade the car in I had my mind set on a Prius but after driving the Prius I happened to look over and see an xD.  The salesman was reluctant but I insisted on driving the vehicle and loved it.  When I saw that it gets only about 11 mpg less than the Prius with a $10K price difference I was sold.  My kids call it the Wii car which is funny.

My husband and I just moved to San Francisco and we quickly realized our '06 Accord was too large for much of the street parking around town.  We did a lot of research and a lot of test driving before settling on the xD.  The car has great handling and can tackle the city's hills with ease. We upgraded to leather, alloy wheels, and a moonroof from the dealer.  This brought the price to just about what we would have paid for a fully loaded civic, but with much more of a ""youthful"" appearance.  It is also great for my 70 mile a day commute to work. Great gas mileage!!","Sporty exterior and roomy interior. We get compliments from strangers around town all the time, everybody wants to know what it is.  I love the availability of options from the dealer to give it a little more luxury.  The iPod connection is awesome, one of the things I longed for in my accord.  ",Scion should offer factory installed moonroof and leather so those of us who love a little more luxury don't have to add aftermarket parts.

We check mileage against fillups/hand calculating, and found the on board mileage computer was pretty accurate.  Lots of leg room, could use maybe another inch of headroom (for me anyway). I'm 6'-3"", over 300lbs (of pure muscle mind you!) & am quite comfortable in it though. The automatic, shifts smoothly into gear, digital display on dash also. Engine has plenty of power, undercarriage/engine noise is quiet except when passing etc. but not that big of a deal. Can get a undercoat like Ziebarts Sound Barrier for $179 to help deaden sound. ","Plenty of power, handles real well on Interstate, did not get the VSC, not needed, we have good traction/control now in Jan weather. Definitely like the looks, roomy interior and cargo area.

When Saab says that their cars were born from aircraft concepts, this Scion can claim the same--in spades.  From the intelligence systems of the engine and brakes to the VSD option, this car screams ultra-high tech in all the right places.  For all the standard features, this car is extravagant when considering the price and ownership costs to all of Europe's fragile models. From fit/finish/handling and roominess to a mild carbon footprint, the xD delivers like an F-14 Tomcat.  This will become the old Beetle of our generation-- vintage classy with stealth technology.","Quick and torquey but dampened ride in addition to super accurate steering.

The engine is nice and smooth with plenty of power, although it seems a little rough when first accelerating with the automatic.  I expect amazing reliability, just like all Toyota's.

Nice looking, great features, 100s of accessories, great gas mileage, great warranty, etc. The list just went on and on. Then I drove and immediately fell in love. My partner kept pushing the BMW, which was really nice and I was about to get it but, I liked the Scion. I would recommend this car as well as the other Scion models to anyone.","Cup holders galore!! I like all the accessories so you can really make the car ""you"". Nice sound system with navigation. I think I like everything about the car.",I would like to see a console in between the front seats and they really need to have a sunroof option in the next models.
4.5,Nice car with a few quirks,Jeff ,11/28/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"This car is overall a great car to have.  It gets good fuel economy, and has enough pick-up to get up to speed on the highway. The small design allows this car to be navigated through the tightest of spaces, while the height that you ride at almost makes you feel like you are riding in a SUV or a crossover.  You do get looks driving in this car, I had a guy in an Acura looking up and down the side of it trying to figure out what I was driving!   ","Steering wheel controls, all the safety features that come standard, sporty look. All standard power features.   ","3 speeds for the windshield wipers? I don't get that, and they call it ""intermittent"". Also, the lack of a center armrest in this car is a drawback.  The rear defroster does not shut off automatically, so you have to make sure to turn it off manually to avoid draining the battery. "
5,This was the best gift for myself ever,Lisa ,11/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had my eyes on this car for the past 3 month, I bought it home with me to many oohhhhs and aaaaahhhh from my family member. When you lay eyes on the Scion from the outside it is TINY, but when you step in it's like magic the inter room is amazing! It felt like I was driving a minivan! Everything is perfect on the car. The only, and I mean the only, complaint is that there is no armrest in the front. Since I bought the car I have been looking for excuses to run errands and go to work, just anything that will let me drive the car. It is an amazing car.","The outside look, inside with lots of space fold down back seat able to adjust the radio without your hands leaving the stereo, the safety features.",Armrest.
4.625,Great Car!,holland6 ,11/21/2007,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,5,5,"I have really enjoyed driving this car. The driver's seat couldn't be more comfortable. I have plenty of leg room and the trunk space will hold more than you think. I like to call this car my TARDIS since it seems so big on the inside, but looks so small from the outside. It gets lots of looks and people ask me about it all the time.  I had a Corolla with 196000 miles on it and my wife has a Matrix. I was going in to buy a new Corolla, but was considering a Matrix too when the xD caught my eye.",I love the stereo and the radio controls on the steering wheel. I like that the back seats can be moved forwards and backwards and lay down flat. The front seats are extremely comfortable.,Rearview mirror can get in the way on an exit ramp. Large blindspot in the back. Would love a center console in the front. Would be nice to be able to just open the glass part of the hatchback.
5,"Easy to Buy, Easy to Drive",romans623 ,11/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Scion has everything done right, from the interactive website where you can build your vehicle, the pure pricing so you know what you're getting, to the buying experience where you pick the transmission, whether to have VSC or not, and then a list of dealer added options.  Then when you get the car, everything is intuitively in the right place, and you don't even have to read the manual, since you can go to the website and watch the instructional videos.  The xD is cute, spunky, has a lot of pep, and feels solid for such a small car.  It's spacious enough for four adults, and very economical on the gas.  It was made for Japanese domestic market so it slips into and out of traffic easily.","The iPod connector. You can use the dial to scroll through playlists, songs, and the titles of the artist and songs are displayed for you. The steering mounted audio controls are nice also. The huge list of standard features. Thoughtful interior design, cool pugnacious exterior, a little bulldog.","Bumpy ride, and rolls around quite a bit on turns."
4.875,Scion xD,melissa ,11/09/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is fun to drive. I think that it gets good gas mileage, and has lots of space to fit five passengers.","My favorite feature I have to say is the stereo and how you can change the station,etc., on the steering wheel. ","This car should have had rims on it instead of the hub caps that seem to pop out once in a while. The car also needs an arm rest in the middle for the driver, personally. But over all it is a great car."
4.75,Love it!,Juanita ,11/08/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"It was between the Versa & the xD. The xD won hands down! I love the cute, sporty look. It handles very well. I only wish the wheel covers weren't so ugly. I test drove the fit, versa, mazda 3 and xD. By far, the xD was the most fun to drive. I get compliments all the time. I haven't seen another on the road. So, I love its uniqueness!","iPod connector, reclining back seat, hidden trunk cargo space, awesome A/C power, displays, cool exterior design, double glove boxes, automatic shifter, headroom, gas mileage, mirror mounted turn signals, 16 in wheels, safety features, sport bucket seats, thick steering wheel, steering wheel control.","Non-lighted window, lock controls, 3 ugly wheel covers."
5,This Is How All Cars Should Be,Mark ,10/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"All cars should be fun to drive, easy on gas, accommodate my iPod and have airbags all around.  The Scion xD is a great value when you shop it against the main competitors here on Edmunds.  Just be sure to add all the extras to the other cars because the Scion xD gives us a lot for our money.   If it does as well as the xA the dealer says it will be in the top 10 for resale value.  And that is for ALL passenger cars.  Toyota makes it.  The dealers sell it without hassling you or lying, and people love it everywhere we go.  If you're looking for a great car for not a lot of money, you should check the xD out.","The stereo.  Controls on the steering wheel!  I can turn the system off or on, adjust the volume, change stations on AM/FM or satellite and change tracks on my CD or iPod.","This is being WAY too picky but I would like mine to be a little more quiet on the highway.  I can still talk in a normal voice to my son in the back seat though, even at 80 MPH."
5,Great car,Jim ,10/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Awesome car!  Recently took a trip 335 miles each way, averaged 39.5 miles per gallon.  The car handles well and is comfortable and relatively quiet.  All the standard safety features make this car an exceptional value.   ","Toyota quality, ride, performance, looks, stereo, etc.",A little more leg room in the front.  
4.625,What fun!,kstroup ,10/22/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This is a great, funky car. Because of the driver position I feel like I'm driving an SUV, but it handles like a sporty little car! Plenty of room for passengers. Has great pickup when you need to accelerate fast. Good gas mileage for a non-hybrid vehicle (averaging 33 MPG and I drive mostly city).","The driver's seat is up high and gives you a great view of the road. Back seat has ""flat"" leg space so there is no hump for the person sitting in the middle.",I wish the cargo/trunk space was larger - if they extended the back of the car a few more inches it would do wonders for storage space.
4.875,Scion xD - Impressive little hatchback,ndave ,10/19/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I'll admit it. I didn't want to look inside this vehicle. However, I bought one. I started by looking at small, affordable econosized cars. I test drove Mazda3 hatchback, Honda Fit and Civic, Toyota Yaris, Corolla (CE, LE, SE) and Matrix. Scion xD offers a smooth ride that picks up nicely and gets you to where you need to go. It's a true city car. Small, compact, affordable and gas economical. Excellent gas ratings (>35mpg), is comfortable in the inside, and is extremely user-friendly. The seats fold down flat in the back. It can haul a ton of stuff; or seat 5 (normal weight) persons very comfortably. Car feels ""euro"" designed. It's an urbanized car that can get around a city easily.","Standard power doors/windows, cruise control, music/vol controls on steering wheel. Comfortable seats and spacious interior, rear seats fold flat, upgraded stereo, 6 speakers, 2 aux outputs, front and side curtain airbag, good safety ratings + reliability ratings, pure pricing, black interior.","It may be bumpy/bouncy on unpaved roads, and there may be increased cabin noise on the freeway. Interior may feel dark at night. Windows may feel small in back. The Pioneer ""joystick"" may be difficult to navigate. Overall I love this car so far!"
5,What a freaking fun car!!!,Jamie ,10/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this car! I test drove the Yaris, the Chevy Aveo and the Corolla and then my salesperson introduced me to the Scion xD. I loved it from the moment I test drove it. I have never smiled during a test drive, but the xD just is fun! I couldn't help it. The standard upgrades like great stereo and iPod hook ups are really great. The get up and go power is much better than the other vehicles that I compared it with. Also the interior room is much more spacious. I wasn't really fond of the interior black color at first, but I have really come to like it. The standard safety features are really nice too. Also, the pure price deal makes the buying process so much easier! I love my scion!",Stereo. Safety features. Get up and go power. AC works great. The look of the car. Great gas mileage.,The back cargo space is rather small but workable. 
5,Ideal compact car for runabout in city,Rose ,10/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I live in the city and have a compact garage where only a very few cars could fit easily. With this in mind I bought the Scion xD. This little car has a ""big car"" feel to it, drives well, has the Toyota assured reliability. I say ""Go for it!!""",I love the external appearance of my silver color automatic.,Make the rear window wider if possible.
5,On the roads of California,ACV ,10/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,A bit noisy when driving past 50 MPH but otherwise a perfect car with lots of great features like a perfect sound system and the abs and airbags throughout features.,Style and sound system.,Make the car a little more insulated from the tire noise when driving fast.
5,Amazing!!,xD ,09/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love my xD, it's my 1st new car. I upgraded from a 91 Acura Integra GS. I love that the Scion looks little but in the inside I feel tall. That was one thing I was worried about when getting a subcompact car, but the standard side curtain airbags are a plus safety feature. It is a little noisy but it has an amazing pioneer stereo system that covers it up. I  love in simple instrument panel. It records my MPG. I got 33.2 MPG on my 1st tank!!",I love being able to control my iPod through the pioneer stereo system. I love the audio control on the steering wheel. I love feeling tall in my little Scion xD. ,"It's meant to seat 5 but I don't think 3 people can seat in the back comfortably. The cargo area can use a little but more room. The iPod control knob on the stereo is very delicate if you're trying to search for a song it starts from the beginning if you stop for 3 seconds, it can get annoying. "
4.875,I love this car!,Betsy ,09/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I got my xD for a long commute - I drive 1000 miles a week on average.  My gas mileage is consistently 35+ mpg on the highway, 32-34 overall.  It's a little noisy, but responsive and smooth.  It's cute as anything; people are always turning to check out my car!  I've never owned a hip car before.  A little more cargo space would be nice.  The stereo controls are great, and I love that cruise control comes standard.  I wish the fuel gauge was a little more attention-getting.  Sometimes I don't notice that I'm low on gas until it's been flashing for a while; it's not very bright.  I actually ran out of gas on my first tank... then again, I should pay more attention!","Great stereo and safety features.  Side curtain airbags (a.k.a. Hummer Protection).  I feel tall, even though it's a sub-compact car.  I love the dual glove compartments, too.  And it's so cute!!  I love it.","There's not a comfortable armrest anywhere, and the headrest is a bit awkward.  Kind of a big blind spot.  "
4.875,2008 Scion xD,Princess ,09/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I was torn between the Scion xD and the Honda Fit. I am glad I got the Scion xD. I like being higher up and the xD feels like a more solid car. All the cars were coming with the upgraded radio, but don't be fooled into buying something you don't want. It was easy and quick to order it my way and have the regular radio put in at the arrival port in Jacksonville. That $389 will pay for my window tinting. The only extras I ordered were the electronic stability control & floor/cargo mats. Every other thing I wanted was included in the basic model. It is a fun car and easy to drive and park. I drove a Chevy Cavalier for 22 years and now am a Scion fan. Great value for the money. ",Small footprint but feels big inside and high up. I can see the world again. ,I would have liked a lighter color interior.
4.875,"Great driving, even in two feet of water",shamanza ,09/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just drove this car today during a torrential storm. It was like driving an SUV.  Whatever the reviews say, take one for a drive and see for yourself. Where else can you get Vehicle Stability Control, a Toyota Corolla engine, great sound, a cool look and a hatchback to boot for quite a good price?  It's a great little car, for the money.","Black exterior, iPod connector, comfortable seats, great sound.",Armrest.
5,New Scion xD Rocks!,joey ,09/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had the 2008 Scion xD automatic for 2 wks and it is a pure pleasure to drive!  Fun in the city!  It twists a lot of heads!  MPG: city 28-30 mpg, on the highway, avg'd 36.5 mpg. I just love driving this car.  It is roomy for 4 adults.  Fantastic stereo sound w/std Pioneer radio.",Attractive styling inside and out.  New 1.8 engine has great pick-up.  Great stereo sound.  The dash and instrumentation is a great improvement over the xA.  Very comfortable seats in front.  Std side curtain and side front seat airbags are big plus and safety features.,"Blind spots with the wide rear pillars behind back seats.  Engine noise.  I would also tweak the arrangement of the instrumentation design and layout for even a more attractive dash for future model years.  Overall though, this is a pure pleasure of a vehicle to drive and to experience."
5,My Wife Loves It !!!,Shella ,09/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I recently bought the Scion xD for my wife and all she does is talk about her car. The ride, performance, and safety features exceed my expectations. If I had an opportunity to change anything about this car, it would be to lower the road noise some. Its a little noisy on rougher roads. My wife and I are both impressed with everything else. Very happy.","Stereo, iPod jack, comfort, and small size makes it very nice in town.","Lower road noise would make this the perfect ""run around town"" car."
5,Better than you might think,cindy ,09/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had the xD for a week and it rocks! I've got the VSC.  When I first drove it to work, co-workers thought I was driving a Lexus, or Acura - in black, the xD is that sharp. It's higher up than you might expect, feels like an SUV on the road.  Great on hilly terrain. Everything about it is nice. It has better lines than the Caliber, the Fit, or other Toyotas.  Not as low as the Matrix or Prius.  Interior dash is attractive, it has great get up and go. It's worth the money, every cent.","Dash, black color, 16 inch tires.","Seat belt is too high, cuts on the neck for smaller people - only has two adjustments."
4.5,My Scion XD,Edwin ,09/01/2007,,,5,5,3,4,,5,4,5,5,"I love this new Scion.  So much fun to drive.  The handling is ok and the performance is fast and smooth.  Like most small cars, space is a problem as there isn't much room in the backseat.  I just wish that the trunk was enlarged also.The left/right turn signal on the side mirrors was a cool design; a copy design from Mercedes.","Handling is great. Price is reasonable. Lots of pep, 128 hp is enough for this tiny but mighty car. Gas mileage is a dream. Average 34 mpg.",Need more room in the backseat and trunk. The plastic interior makes the car feel cheap. 
4.875,What a great and fun car,Love It! ,08/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My initial opinion of the car was that it looked so small. Once I opened the door and got inside, however, I was shocked! The interior is not only spacious but incredibly well laid out. I'm six feet tall and fit easily into the seats with ample head room to spare. The controls were especially well designed and the overall feel of the dash was that it was designed with purpose and care. Comparable models and brands often just throw a slab of plastic on and a few radio knobs and call it a dash but Scion thoughtfully put together a great interior for its owners.","iPod hookup which allows you to play, charge, and control your iPod right from the stereo itself. No more reaching down and dangerously changing songs while driving! Overall layout of dash, trunk space, retractable antenna for car washes, comfortable front seats, quality of sound system.",You need to buy the floor mats. I didn't and spent forever trying to cut mine to fit the bizarre floorboard space. The controls for the windows and locks on the door do not light up which leaves me guessing at it until I memorize where they are. Shifting into reverse is difficult at times.
5,I'm in love,Eris ,08/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just bought my xD two days ago and I haven't even learned how to use 90% of the features and can't really rate it on reliabity, fuel consumption, etc., yet. It's fun to drive and extremely potent for its size. Leg room isn't important to me since I'm 5'2. I really fell in love with it's design. To me it doesn't look like a rhino, it's a curvy cute alternative to the boxy boyish xB. ",I love being able to control the radio on the steering wheel.,"I wish the speedometer marked 30 mph instead of 40. Imagine a clock that marked 2, 4, 8, 10 instead of 3, 6, 9, 12. City speed limit is usually 30."
4.875,Love it,mtubbs ,08/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I have had it for about a week, first tank of gas was 32.5 mpg on the first tank blended city/hwy.  I downsized from an Acura TSX and while the xD isn't the same type of car, I actually prefer it when you factor in its affordability. It has enough pick-up to merge on I-95 when it is moving and keep up once you are on.  I am 6'3"" and I can sit comfortably in the backseat with the driver's seat adjusted back.  I also drove the Fit Sport, and the xD feels like a much more substantial car and has much better pick-up on the road.","Integrated iPod controls, fuel efficiency, and engine power",Do something with large blind spots in the back.
5,Great entry level car,john ,08/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"It was between the Scion xD and the Honda Fit.  I test drove the fit and then the xD and there was no decision to be made - the xD easily.  The cars are comparable, except the engine.  You can really feel the xD's power compared to the Fit, and it makes the Fit feel cheap.  The only 2 issues with the xD: 1) The cabin ride is not very quiet.  If you like a silent ride, this is NOT the car for you. 2) No arm rest.  I have a stick, so this isn't so much of an issue.  But if I had an auto, this would drive me insane.","Smaller size so I can fit anywhere. Yet, the inside is quite roomy, even in the back.  The seats are also comfy. Nice list of standard safety features was a plus. Bigger engine than other cars in the same class. For me, the combined speedometer/tachometer is easier to read than two separate meters.",Optional arm rest. Be able to slide down hatch-window. Quieter cabin ride.
4.75,An easy pick,D.C. ,08/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"Just purchased. Where else can you get a fully loaded automatic for under 16K? Plus the Toyota reliability factor and excellent gas mileage (27-32 mpg under the more strict 2008 EPA standards). The ride is very nice. Handling is tight and the xD's engine is more than adequate (128hp 4 cyl). In comparison, the Honda Fit (109hp) and Toyota Yaris (106 hp) don't come close. There's plenty of passenger room in the interior and the 60/40 split rear seats fold flat for plenty of cargo space. The standard 160-watt Pioneer stereo system with 6 speakers sounds great.The Scion xD offers the little intangibles that you just cannot find in any car in its class.You can't go wrong with the Scion xD.","The xD has a dedicated iPod adapter that you can control on the stereo face. Fuel economy is excellent. I got 36 mpg on my first tank of gas. The xD has a digital display that tracks your mileage. It resets every time you fill up. Love the safety features (6 air bags and ABS), price.   ","For people like me who love having a center arm rest, Scion will be offering it this fall as an accessory. Other than that, I can't think of any improvements so far. Scion has done very well with the xD."
5,xD Love,peacegal ,08/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I LOVE my new peppy xD! I'm impressed with this small bundle of energy and very pleased that I didn't go with the Honda Fit or the Toyota Matrix. The xD comes standard with lots of features and the only extra added was an alarm. Everyone who has ridden in it has fallen in love. A terrific buy so far!,The iPod connection and stereo control on steering wheel.,Better arrangement of trunk covers. More choices for interior colors. Um... can't think of anything else at the moment. 
2.5,Overpriced for what you get,DL ,08/09/2007,,,1,3,4,4,,2,1,3,2,"My wife bought this monday. Over all it is not a bad car but dealing with Scion dealers left a bad taste in our mouth. Scion likes to claim they have a ""Pure Price"" that is set by Scion but the dealers pile on doc fees and every other fee you can think of. But that is enough about the horrible dealers and lets talk about the xD. The car itself is very small. It is basicly a four door toyota yaris but it does have side airbags standard and in this car you will need them in a T bone crash. My wife thought the ride of the car was ok but to me it felt just like the old scion xA which was bumpy and cheap feeling. The car has about 23 more hp than the xA but on the road you cannot feel it.",It is a cute car in a dorky kind of way and I guess that is who scion is marketing it to. It handles ok for a small car but it does still have the low end feel to it.,"Gas milage so far has not been that good. The car is avergaing 34 mpg on the Hway so far. I expected a lot more from a econo box. Also Scion dealers are horrible with fees. I will not buy another car from Scion. Their ""Pure Price"" is a joke. Over all this car is over priced for what you get."
