I bought brand new for fiancee at the time and before 40,000 had to replace clutch, power steering, alternator, etc. It had an electrical fire. Not comfortable at all. I am 5'6 and have to sit with knees rubbing the plastic under the wheel to press the clutch. Has so many airbags in little space that if I got into accident they would snap by neck. Two of the doors will not lock- not even manually. Power mirrors stopped working not a fuse. Still can not turn with out feeling like I am working out.  Think 5 recall letters.",,
4.875,Love This SUV,Love My First SUV ,10/28/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I've only owned this vehicle for a couple of months and I'm very pleased. This is my very first SUV. My sister owns a Sonata and my dad owns a 2007 Tucson and I've never heard them complain so I got one. My Tucson is a 2.0L 4-cyl but I like it. Could do a lot better on gas. ,I love how the headlights turns off once the keys are removed from the ignition. Radio is also decent.,Make the center console armrest a little bigger
4.375,Best Vehicle I've Driven,Greg S. ,08/17/2010,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"In driving cars since 1975 the Tucson is the best vehicle I've owned. Does it have shortcomings, of course. But, I knew that when I bought it. As of 8-16-10 I have 36,000 and not one problem. Tires are still very good, oil is changed every 3,000 to 4,000 and lubed. Preventive maintenance is key. The only thing I don't like it that it is noisy from a tire standpoint. Good mileage up to 27 mpg on the highway and about 22 in local traffic. It's just a nice vehicle.   ",I really like the CD and cassette feature. It is one of the reasons why I chose it. Comfortable seating for me and my wife. Smaller people like the back. ,Not sure what can be done but more soundproofing coming from the wheels.
4.125,Does What I Want,DAS ,04/02/2010,,,4,3,5,5,,4,4,3,5,"We bought a used 2008 Hyundai Tucson 4x4, 2.7L V-6 last year from CarMax to replace our 2005 RAV4 after a wreck.  So far, we are satisfied with the Tucson.  I had a chance to try out the ABS, traction control, 4 wheel drive, and stability control several times this winter in New Mexico - it all works well.  At 21k, the Bridgestones are already showing moderate wear, so we'll be looking at new tires probably by 30k or so.  I'm not overly impressed with the 2.7L V-6.  It's short on power and only averages around 19 to 20 mpg, giving us the power of a 4 and the mileage of a 6, the worst of both worlds.  But it's reliable with no mechanical or quality issues.  So far, so good.   ","The safety features give us a confident feeling on the open road.  The Tucson may not be in the same league nor command as much respect as the RAV4 and CRV, but for the money, it's a heck of a good value.  ","I've already mentioned the engine.  I was initially impressed with the dual tailpipes in the rear until I got under the vehicle to check out the exhaust and other parts and pieces.  I was amused to find that the exhaust is only a single pipe and large muffler, with two tailpipes exiting the rear."
4.5,Great buy!,DeeJai ,11/16/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"I bought my Hyndai Tucson in late '08 at a decent ""end of model year"" discount. This is by far the smallest, and only front wheel drive suv I have ever owned but it has proven it self very capable. I have taken it from Washington, to Utah, to Alaska, all the way up to Inuvik,NWT (look it up on a google) and then all the way to New York. It does amazingly well on snow (with some good snow tires)and even handles mud and dirt roads with ease. All around I'm sure glad I bought a Tucson! ","I love the way the shift is set up, night and high without taking up too much room as well as the great factory installed speakers. Just about everything in the vehicle is very well thought out. ",A few complaints I have with this model: The center console is too far back if your on the shorter side making it hard to rest your arm. 
3.625,Comfy but not practical,nomer ,10/15/2009,,,4,4,3,4,,3,5,2,4,"Bought this 10 months ago and am looking to trade it in even though I know I will take a loss.  has tons of cargo space and leg room, but the motor works too hard. Doesn't feel like it shifts properly.  Not very darty--takes a long time to accelerate.  Gas mileage for me has been consistently at 18 miles and less. I have never gotten even 19 mile per gallon as stated.  14 gallon tank is small--feels like I am always at the gas station.  radio and amenities are positioned well for a comfy ride.  Great heat and A?C but is hard to hear radio over it--not strong speakers","Roomy,with lots of storage.  I love the color, too!  It looks good! Unfortunately, good looks is about all it has going for it.","It needs a tougher exterior.  It dings and dents very easily.  Also, If I let the gas get too low, it will only fill up to 7 gallons.  I think the sensor is broken.  Overpriced for such a vehicle that does not seem too powerful, and is a gas hog,  Blind spot is behind drivers seat."
4.5,Not a bad ride,SLU2 ,06/24/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,As much legroom as a Ford Explorer but much better fuel economy...,Stylish and nimble handling. The V-6 has good power..,Automatic light sensing headlights and a compass and temp feature
4.5,Best bang for the buck,Craig ,05/31/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"Purchased this SUV after having a 4 cyl 5 speed Sante Fe for 4 years & was quite happy with both service & reliability with Hyundai vehicles. Was looking for something comparable & found the 4 cyl 5 speed Tucson surprisingly similar to drive. Handles very well in the city with great gas mileage. Having purchased a front-wheel drive, a good set of snow tires handled winter driving in the snow well. The highway driving is very good but the engine works harder on hills with 4 passengers and a full load, which is to be expected. Interior noise is surprisingly quiet for a hard working engine as well as very smooth handling. Recommend this vehicle with anyone with kids.Trunk space is a minimum","Low noise interior, Good road handling in all weather conditions. Recommend 5speed with a 4 cylinder. Excellent city driving & good highway driving. ",Base model to have cruise control. 
4.75,My new car is a sporty SUV,Sarde ,04/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I bought this car last week when my 90 Civic gave up the ghost.  My wife and I are just married and we wanted a car we could take the future family and dog camping in. Plus it will be fun for our active/cycling lifestyle. I can fit a tandem bike in it with all the seats down!  It was also important as this would be a family car that it have good safety features, it does! My wife has a 07 Sonata and we love its safety and quality which, is why we considered getting another Hyundai. And it rides so very smooth on my 40 mile daily commute.  It was priced so competitively that we came in under budget, which makes up for the lower MPG. I can live with that now that I have a little more power-v6","High view of the road, cargo capacity, leather steering wheel, leather heated seats, good visibility, phenomenal safety features, rims are standard, fun to drive and a nice 6 disk stereo.","More MPG and power efficient engine like Honda's or Toyota's, better placement of the cargo cover, less invasive wind screen for the sunroof (it blocks much of the view), nicer subwoofer, and a better setup for the trip computer maybe adding a screen somewhere else for mileage related information."
4.5,New owner,longbeachjohn ,03/28/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Drove a 6cyl then a 4 cyl and there was very little difference in performance.  Car has good space inside, controls and features great.  I appreciate the safety stuff like traction and stability control and all the airbags.  First weekend cruise got 24+ mpg, mixed bag intown and freeway at 75+.  Will update in the future.  Like to see more cubby holes for things like cel phone.  ",,
4.75,Best SUV I've owned,coyote prosapio ,03/27/2009,,,5,3,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We live in the ""outback"" of New Mexico, a mix of bad paved roads and dirt. I've owned a 4-Runner, a Tundra, a Subaru and a mix of Detroit bummers, this small SUV is at the top of the list. We got about 27mpg in the Subaru along with a tough ride. We get a great ride in the Tundra, but truck mileage. In the Hyundai we get 30 on the highway and a Tundra ride. (and a Tundra sound system, AM/FM/CD/Cassette.) I hope this one is as long lasting as a Toyota 'cause we intend to keep it as our main ride. I've read the comments about ""ungainly ride"" but that isn't my experience at all. In fact this one rides as well as the Tundra which is like a limo. ","Ride, gas mileage, power (V-6, Auto) which outperforms our '01 Outback, comfort, good seats, room, and a quiet ride which I expect will improve once I replace the Bridgstones with Michelins. ","I'm not crazy about the exterior design, but this ugly duck gives us too many up-sides to make that ""problem"". The Subaru looks a lot better but the trade off of ride discomfort hardly makes that important. I could care less about ""turning heads"" given the pluses of this vehicle. "
4.875,a wonderful little SUV,awongmath ,03/16/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have owned this little SUV for 15 months now, with nary a service problem or defect.  I test drove a RAV4, VUE, Escape, and the CRV; I needed a vehicle that could easily tote my daughter's everyday wheelchair and a sport wheelchair.  This SUV is roomy (can hold her everyday wheelchair in the back or two medium dog crates w/o putting the rear seat down), is great fun to drive, and the turning radius is good (better than Mazda MPV, about the same as a Camry, not as good as a Volvo or BMW sedan).

3.125,"hmmmmm, jury is still out.",Salem Boicot ,11/20/2008,,,3,3,4,4,,2,4,2,3,"So far, I like the general conservative styling of the vehicle. I have the black interior which gets rid of a lot of the tackiness and cheap feel. Audio is great. Handling is brilliant for a car in its' class. A few blind spots, but otherwise vision is good. Space is well used in car, although question to the depth of the dashboard, could be smaller so that the interior is forward with larger boot. Fuel economy and engine performance is rubbish. Thus far have got no where near what the dealer claimed, transmission is horrible, it needs 5 gears with better ratios, and it loves a drink. You watch the fuel gauge more than the road. Don't get this if you want an economical car.","The comfort of the seats, as I am about 175cm high, and 75 kgs, it fits me well, all controls are well placed and easy to reach, room is pretty good considering it is not a huge car, handles really well surprising for a vehicle of its' price, style, and size.","The 2.0ltr engine needs a re-design to a longer stroke or something, maybe even to be a 2.4 ltr 4 cylinder, the transmission needs a 5th gear so that the gears will change to improve fuel economy and not work the engine so hard. It can never seem to find the right gear. The ratios need working out."
3.5,Great vehicle,DeerJohn ,11/17/2008,,,3,4,4,4,,3,4,2,4,"When I decided I no longer needed a pickup, I looked at RAV4 and CRV, but chose the Hyundai because of price and warranty.  I no longer consider American-made cars.  The Tucson is roomy, comfortable, handles well, and has great visibility.  The 4c engine seems noisy and underpowered to me compared to my wife's 4c Accord, but I no longer need those features.  I did expect better gas mileage than 24 mpg, but that may improve.  One bad feature is the light-colored interior, which is hard to keep clean.  Did not think of that when I bought.  I always felt that home carpets and car interiors should be a dark color, as people tend to walk on them.  Seatcovers and mats help.","handles well, turns well, good visibility, comfortable adjustable seats, good sound system, nice clean exterior lines, folding rear seats.","Darker interior (floors and seats), better gas mileage, odometer display on panel too large and too bright."

My previous relationship was a Hyundai (Elantra) and that alone convinced me that this was a firm purchase and solid vehicle.  I love the way it handles and the space on the inside.

4.25,I'm sold on Hyundai,JerZee ,09/30/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"Great car, great price, room galore. Quite, solid ride. My insurance went down $240 a year because of the safety features. Traded in my 2007 Patriot with no regrets. Tucson has larger storage area, more comfortable seats and sits higher. Very good mileage for this type of vehicle in a 4 cyl. A 4x4 will use more gas. 6 cyl,not worth the trade off for the difference in horsepower and mileage. Trailer hitch can tow small loads from the home centers. It is a heavy vehicle, with the front wheel drive, 4 wheel isn't needed if you're not an offroader. Quieter then the Rav4. Switched to synthetic oil increased mileage slightly. Still breaking in average about 24.4 mpg on hwy. ","Like the leather seats,locking glove compartment, opening rear window, minimal road noise, great sound system, six air bags,ESC","Higher or adjustable arm rest, valet key, bench seat.

1.875,Roller coaster ride / Unsafe to drive,Charley ,05/08/2008,,,4,3,1,1,,2,1,2,1,"1.  During the week of April 1, I discovered the car was producing a bumpy ruff, roller coaster ride; tossing me up and down, back and forth and side to side.  The seat was not absorbing the shock nor was it adjusting for my comfort.      Then came the shocker:  the car's right back wheel seemed to slide to the right, bumped, then righted itself.  I was instantly knocked to the right and then back to center.  This action takes less than a second and seems to happen on an uneven indentation, ridge or something in the road.   This happens out of the blue and I do not feel safe. I notified Robert Lawson of my unhappiness with the seat and the ruff ride.  ",There are many things I like about the Tucson.  The dash board is well lit up and large enough to read the information.  The mirrors on the side of the car and in the center give an excellent view of cars behind and at the side.  No blind spots.  Alpine Frost color is great.,The seats need to be improved so the body doesn't roll from side to side. The body and the seat must be connected. Bobbing and weaving must stop. Figure out what causes the surging fix it.  The back wheels need to work in unison not independent of each other. The car must work as one connected body

My only real complaint is one I already knew about and applies to any SUV and that is the mileage.  I'm averaging about 20mpg which is a combo of hwy/city driving.
