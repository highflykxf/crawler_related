VCM creates more problems than it solves.  I wish that wasn't so.  The Honda techs are saying this and, almost, apologetic about it.  I wish that I could do my part to cut down on fuel consumption to be environmentally friendly. The problem is, the poorly implemented VCM causes me to go through 5 quarts of oil every 5,000 miles. I've had to replace cylinder rings and motor mounts and things are still not right. There's a TSB for this that's supposed to cover 2008+ vehicles but, for whatever reason, it doesn't apply to mine.  So I'm stuck with the options to sell it (and pass this nightmare on to someone else who will develop the same feelings about Honda as I) or to remain on a first name basis with the Service Manager.",,

Honda knows there have been problems with this particular year, yet, will not make me whole.  My warranty, of course, was useless.  I was over my miles by 200 miles, all highway miles en route to my father in laws funeral.  They didn't do sqaut for me!  Let's just say I will not be buying another honda again.  They're no longer 'reliable' to me and they produced an inferior product.  I've got two old Fords that are still kicking!  I'll be buying American moving forward...thanks to honda.",What good are features if the damn car is not reliable!,"My impression is you have cut corners in production or something.  I spent nearly $24K plus interest to buy this van on the BELIEF it would be reliable (even new used), because it was a HONDA.  How foolish I was and how do I truly regret making this buy.  

There is something wrong with the engine in the production model and you are perfectly willing to let the consumer bear the burden for your lack of engineering effort and honesty.  Forget the model, your engines are supposed to be one of the most envied, with a long history of useful life.  What happened?  Is the need to cut cost so strong, so needed by your shareholders, that you're willing to lose your reputation in the process? "
5,My Favorite Van Ever!!!,undy6 ,12/23/2014,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had 3 Odysseys - an '07 EX-L DVD, an '08 EX-L w/NAV & DVD and a '12 Touring Elite. I've had a lot of cars, SUV's and minivans and the '08 Odyssey was my fav by far! I actually think it was better than the '12 Odyssey Touring Elite we leased.  Zero issues, super practical features & layout, easy and comfortable to drive....I could go on and on. Only reason I don't still have it is because I was having issues getting traction in the snow (lived in Denver at the time) so I traded for a 4WD Nissan Armada. I regretted that decision almost immediately, still miss that van 3 yrs later!

I found the original TSB for the brakes and insisted they perform that ""fix""a new VSA stability module I paid $400for the part.

More comfortable, better ride, great interior space, clever storage, many features standard on the EX and when the brakes worked I was very happy.","Honda must re-engineer the brakes! When the van was new the brakes worked well and I felt very safe. Honda doesn't stand behind problems unless you fight them.
Reading reviews I worry about a low mileage transmission failure which is a very common and expensive problem with minivans (my Dodge). It looks like I should look forward to a motor mount replacement.
I do not believe Honda has maintained the quality control that they built their reputation on. I no longer trust Honda. I do not believe they stand behind their products. They should not be cavalier about vehicle safety. They must not test their products leaving this work and risk to the buyers. "

It is a nice ride for a longer road trip or hauling people around, probably the best minivan out there right now, not that there is a very large selection available. On the down side it is far from perfect. First of when you get a car that is $40000+ you should expect better interior materials, especially on the dash. It's all hard plastic, kinda like the pre- 2007 GM's. I have owned infinities before in the same price range and the dashes were much more luxurious. Secondly the seats other then the driver  side are not exactly comfortable. The backs stick out to much.

There are a few things I miss, like the memory seats (I'm 6'1"", my wife 5'2""), auto headlights, rear sensors and the rear power door, some of which should be standard.  We compared the new Chrysler van (a relative has comparable one), and they are by far more feature intensive at the same price, but they just didn't have the same level of comfort and the gas mileage isn't as good.

I had a v-8 Ford Explorer beforehand, and the Honda has as much acceleration at the Explorer.  The brakes are fantastic, highly responsive, excellent stopping distance.  We settled for the EX model because for the features in the EX-L, we couldn't justify the price.  I don't understand the other comments re: road noise--our van is by far one of the quietest vehicles I've ever driven.  Gas mileage isn't too bad--we consistently get 24 highway--but city suffers a bit at 17 mpg on average.

Around-town fuel economy averages about 19 MPG).  The big test came last week when our family of 4 took a trip from So. Cal to the Bay Area. The Odyssey was *extremely* comfortable over the entire trip. The kicker was that I calculated that the van got **27.9 MPG** on the freeway.

Our problems to date include: steering spline knock, faulty wheel alignment, engine ping/knock, oil leak, rattling front windows, and Air Conditioning that currently works only on the passenger side.

Our new Odyssey drives smoothly, rides without wallowing, gets good MPG, has a tight turning circle and more traveling comfort than anything on the market.","Seats, nav system, room, ",Steering a little vague compared to a car.
4.625,Incredible Car,Scottque ,12/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"We bought a 2008 Touring the week before Thanksgiving.  Needless to say we never expected to be thrilled with any minivan, but this is an amazingly well-designed, very sophisticated vehicle.  It handles, turns, and rides like a much smaller car, and the interior room, technology, design and versatility are wonderful.  The car is simply loaded, and has so many features (bluetooth, voice recognition, navigation, backup camera, DVD) that were not included/available on our more- expensive XC90.  Terrific car that us hard to find fault with.   ","Back-up camera, DVD/Audio System, GPS, seating for 8, power doors and tailgate, well-designed instrumentation, smooth ride","Rear floor mats do not stay in place well, homelink buttons unlit and hard to find at night."
4.625,Honda Does It Again,Daddypo ,12/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Great vehicle.  I was impressed with the comfort and upscale feel of this van.  Traded in a 2000 Dodge van, and the difference was amazing.  I did not notice any problem with road noise, which is a common complaint against Honda per the magazine reviews.  This van has plenty of power, comfortable ride, and good gas mileage (for a van at least).  Total package.",I like the VCM that improves gas mileage.  We will see how it holds up.,"So far, my only suggested improvements (after less than 5 days and 100 miles) would be:  The rear windows do not open, as they do in other minivans.  No built in child seat, as in other minivans."
5,Great Vehicle so Far!,Beebow ,12/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is our first Honda and we are loving it. ,"Styling, ride, comfort, handling, power passenger seat, heated seats.",Rear vent windows
5,Best minivan in the market by far,JUSTIN BRIGGS ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've put apx 8,000 miles on my ODY and not a single complant.  It has plenty of power on demand and goes on ECO mode when cruising.  DVD player is a must have on those longer trip for the kids.  Quality is suprior in it's class.  I will buy another ODY, No questions ask.  Hondas will always be the top contender in it's class, just read consumer reports.  Never a let down year.",Everything,Add an AWD option
4.625,2008 Odyssey Touring,Ted ,12/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"I traded in my old 2001 Odyssey EX w/NAV for a 2008 Odyssey Touring w/o PAX. It's been about month since I purchased it and everybody loves it.  The $3,000. discount off of MSRP from the dealer was a big incentive. In terms of quality, comfort, fun to drive, handling, and entertainment features, it's been great for my wife  and our kids. For such a complex vehicle with all of its gadgets, there has not been one defect so far; not even a rattle or squeak.  The only negative I have seen so far is the mileage is not all that good.  My average mpg is around 14.  My old 2001 Odyssey had better average mpg at 18.","DVD entertainment system (great with the kids), Navigation integrated with Bluetooth, premium stereo with XM.","Signal mirrors w/remote folding, power folding third row seats, active head rests for all of the seats, better mileage or a hybrid version."
4.875,2008 Odyssey Touring (NO PAX),Scott ,12/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Overall, it's a great car. Already over 1000 miles on it. Works like a champ and drives great. Be sure to buy it without PAX/Runflats. We waited for '08 so we could get normal all season radials. Went through Costco buying program, cost $37,500 (500 over invoice) ",Rear DVD entertainment and automatic side & rear doors,"My first NAV system - its a bit complicated. I would rather not have one, but it is standard on the touring. "
5,Great Vehicle,first-timer ,12/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We love our new Odyssey. It has plenty of pickup, and delivers close to 20 MPG in regular driving, meaning some town, some freeway. All freeway we're getting close to 25mpg. I think the people getting 13 or whatever have a lead foot or do a lot of stop and go. So far no defects except for a carpet stain that we found after buying it. The dealer cleaned it up, and I think a mechanic probably did it or something. This engine really pushes hard above 3000 revs, and it sounds wonderful doing it. The Sienna felt like a barge next to this, and the Caravan and Chrysler both seemed too ""plastic"" or something. The Honda fit us great.","3-Zone temperature control, 8th seat, good-sounding 3.5 engine, 6CD, dashboard and gauges","Not a big fan of the wheel design, but on a van, who cares right? I wish the keyless entry worked from farther away, even though it isnt bad now."
5,Great Vehicle so Far!,beebow1 ,12/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is our first Honda and we couldn't be more pleased. I am an engineer and appreciate what they have done to produce such a versatile vehicle. My wife loves the van and I have to say that I love it also. No problems so far. The ride is excellent and the handling is great. I have a high performance sports car so the comparison is valid. We went with the 08' because of the newer engine technology, options not included on the 07' model. and the new look. Pricing was higher, but we feel it was worth it. I just asked my wife if she had any other comments and she responded ""I love it"".","Looks, variable cylinder management, ride, comfort features.",Some buffeting from the rear windows when rolled down with no other windows open. Hard to find fault with this vehicle so far. 
5,2008 honda odyssey beats other vans ,John Topi ,11/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I bought this beautiful van in october. I love the 2008 odyssey's solidness and luxury. This van has nothing wrong and at 4000 miles it's never had a single problem. If you are looking for a van the Honda Odyssey should be your only option!,Honda reliability and everything else.,Nothing at all
4.625,2008 Odyssey,Pam ,11/22/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Touring model is a lot of fun for media fanatics. There are potentially 6 different sources of entertainment for one car and for a large family that drives a lot it is fantastic. The van is top notch for driving, handling and overall fun for civilized driving.","Nav, Blue tooth, MP3 Aux input, DVD system. Solid feel to it with no real weakneses.",Perhaps some more horse power. Add 4- wheel-drive option.
1.25,Sorry I bought it.,Hannah Lechenstien ,11/09/2007,,,1,2,1,1,,1,2,1,1,I have only driven this van about 3000 miles and I have to say that I am VERY DISSAPOINTED in HONDA PRODUCTS!.  I have been to the dealership a total of twelve times for an array of problems.  The sliding door fell of it's track onto my 7 year old's foot.  The DVD player keeps skipping. The lights on the dash will go out with no warning.  The brakes are starting to squeek when they are hot. It has terrrible gas miledge (13 city/16 hwy).  I had traded a Dodge Durango that got better gas mpg than this thing.  And it never broke down or sent me to the dealership for any repairs.  I have almost three years left on the lease of this scary creature.  I don't think I'm going to make it.,I thought the DVD would be a great feature for my children but it doesn't work.  ,Honda should stick to things it knows.  God knows it isn't cars and trucks.  Maybe just make motorcycles.  Anyone want to take over a lease out there?
