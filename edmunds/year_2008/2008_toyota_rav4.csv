Also I can put lumber on top of it and carry it home strapped down.  The mileage is excellent.  I was getting 13 to 15 miles on my pickup but the RAV 4 gets 20 with the AC on and almost 30s with out the AC on.,,
5,Best Car I've Owned,Carolynn W ,09/21/2016,5,3,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I was so very happy with my purchase of a 2008 RAV4 Limited. I purchased it slightly used (5000 miles!) in 2009. I never had a single problem with it, other than having to take care of the manufacturer recalls from Toyota. I had it regularly maintained at the dealer and I was always happy with the service I received there. I had just recently crossed the 100,000 mile mark on it and was ready to drive it another 100,000 miles. Unfortunately, someone decided to run a red light and they totalled my RAV4. It was a side impact and the RAV4 did a wonderful job of protecting me from serious injury. I bought her for her predicted reliability and safety and she earned 5 stars for both. Now I'm having to shop for a new car, and while I do love all the new technology that is out, I will miss all the storage space, the engine, and the reliability of my RAV4. I highly recommend this vehicle as long as you can find a version that was maintained well by the owner.",,
5,Really Suprised !,Anton Tesla ,11/24/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"Having had the car for 3 months now, I'm definitely impressed with it overall. I bought it used with 11300 miles on the odometer and was amazed to get the previous owners Impressive maintenance records ! Regular scheduled service from day one with quality tires, synthetic oil and fluid changes and genuine Toyota replacement parts. It came with a complete 5 tire set of Firestone Destination m+s radials with less the 2500 miles on them ! The handling of this vehicle has been a real treat with the new car handling without the new car sized payment ! Both in town and on the highway, it rides and drives like it is on rails. I've taken it to our camp in Northern NH and was pleasantly surprised by the way it handled our sometimes sketchy access road with its ruts and mud holes. The 4wd pulled nicely and the suspension kept the rolling and pitching to acceptable levels. The 2.4 4 cyl motor is averaging 22 mpg and it has plenty of power to pull my small utility trailer with either the 4 wheeler or snowmobile on it. The roominess and storage capacity combined with the overall secure feeling the car has while driving it, has me really pleased with the purchase of this Rav4 !7 months later, Big surprise at our 1st state inspection ! Both rear coil springs had snapped and jumped up over the top retainer ?? The muffler also had a pin hole ! I called the dealer and asked about our 2 year warranty coverage that we had to purchase to close the sale ? He says those are wear and tear parts, not covered ?  GRR ! After 4 "" Garage Mechanic "" quotes ranging from $1098.99 to $2900.00 for ""Dealer only"" parts and labor, I about Freaked !!! After a few Strong Toddies and a day or two to cool off, I decided to tackle it myself ! I spent two days surfing for parts and I scored new heavier springs from HD SPRINGS , an Firestone air bag kit and Walker SS muffler for $316.00 !! It took 12 hours for me to swap out old for new. I increased my towing capacity by 1000 LBS and my Rav4 really handles like a new car and tows with No Sag !!  LOVIN IT !!",,

The two extra hidden storage behind the rear seats are awesome as well as the three 12v outlets and iPod jack. Seats are super comfortable. The 4WD handles off-road duties superbly. Everything on this vehicle is laid out well with emphasis on order and functionality. Purchased rain guards, mud flaps, bug deflector, and better crossbars for my kayaks to make it perfect.

This car easily tops the list. For a high sitting car, it handles very well with the 18inch rims and 235mm tires. It actually rides better the the Subaru WRX and feels commanding and not cheap.The torque steer of my limited is not there and feels very even. The car is very fast for its size, suprisingly faster than most cars off the line. Its really an understated car. JBL upgrades stereo is more than adaquate, and the black interior looks sweet. ","Power, handling, reliability. Safety - I tested this when a 2.5' tree fell onto the car while I was driving at 25mpg. The car was totaled but I came out without a scratch... thats why this is my second RAV4. This time I chose the Sport over the Limited as the suspension is definatelly more responsive.","The button press - second glove compartment is goofy!

This is only true with the 5-speed transmission on the V6 (not the 4-cyl.)The now infamous ""whining transmission"" noise that has been well documented on the owner's forums (search transmission noise on RAV4 World and others) is something you will want to consider when you're buying this vehicle used.Also the poor response from Toyota in fixing the problem under warranty has completely soured me on the ownership experience, so I wouldn't be able to recommend this car to anyone.Go with Honda.","Engine power, cargo room, visibility for shorter drivers.","Fix this noisy transmission!

After replacing the breaks and the tires (after 6 months of ownership) I was a little discouraged.

Test drove the Mitsubishi Outlander but the Rav 4 blew it away in performance and quality. I ordered the bumper guard to protect the very deep rear bumper and the vinyl cargo tray. ",MP3 jack. Cargo space can be configured so many ways. V6 power is awesome. Brakes are great.

4.5,Could be better,jerry ,05/05/2009,,,4,3,5,5,,5,4,5,5,I love this SUV. I had a jeep and traded for this for fuel economy. I averaged over 26 mph on a 1000 mile trip. I don't like the excess engine noise when cold. Seats are hard but for a smaller person comfortable. Performance is better than Pontiac gt with 3.8. Some wind noise but have a Lexus also and it's quiet. Great steering response in the mountains where I live. Corners not a problem.

Other than that, the RAV 4 is a great little car -- especially with the V6.  I've had the dealership tear the vehicle down looking for the reason why there is no heat coming from the ducts in the second and third row seats.  Their final verdict -- verified by Toyota's engineers -- the system is functioning as designed.  Since I live in Wisconsin, going with a marginal heater is not an option.  Toyota's suggestion -- trade it in for something that has heat but I take the loss on the vehicle -- about a $3-4K hit.  Pretty rotten on Toyota's part but they know I have no choice.","V6 engine (very nice), just about everything else is good except the heater.","Fix the heater!  Even in the two row version the heater is still weak!  For future buyers, Toyota says they have no plans to change the heater.  They only plan to eliminate the third row seat option.  Also, I suggest having all the various buttons on the steering wheel, etc., illuminate in the dark."
4.125,Good family hauler,tireguy ,04/21/2009,,,4,3,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"No surprises with the RAV4.  I dove into this purchase with extensive research, and optioned it precisely to suit my family's needs (well, mostly my needs): Limited, V6, 4wd, leather, JBL, 3rd row, tow package.  On paper, it's exactly what a family of 5 needs to motor about the local area (with three kids in car seats) in a bit of style.  What this vehicle lacks (unbeknownst to the spec-sheet analyst) is any serious personality.  It's fast, but handles like a van.  It's a suitable light-medium duty tow vehicle; I frequently tow a 2,000 lb enclosed trailer and barely know it's there.  The interior is laid out fine.  Exteriorwise, the front is nice, but the back bumper is just plain ugly.","Powerful V6, almost too powerful for the suspension. Leather seats are firm, but comfortable. 3rd row seats flip up individually, so you can still transport a large, long item with three kids still seated by flipping down only one side of the middle and 3rd row.  Note the 3rd row is only for kids.",Redo the ugly rear bumper.  Include the dealer option bumper protector film as standard (so you don't scratch it). Figure out a better system for the mid-center seat belt. Stiffen the suspension on V6 models. Add a rub strip along the side; the naked doors are just begging for parking lot dings.

The interior is comfortable, roomy, and full of great extras. The sound system rocks with the JBL subwoofer. I tow a jet ski down on the beach with it and you can't even feel the ski back there.

The 4 cyl engine is amazing and the braking is the best I've ever had in a car. There are a lot of little extras which are nice.  I have only two real complaints.  The seat, while having a good lumbar support are quite uncomfortable.  If you test drive be aware.  The mileage is somewhat under the estimated mileage.  My mixed city-highway is running between 18-21 mpg.  Last, they should have had some heavy duty cover on the back bumper.  It can easily get roughed up as you put things in the rear.  They offer a little plastic cover, but it does not cover the critical area.  This may have been fixed in the 2009 model.

4.25,Oh what a feeling?,Brad ,01/15/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,4,3,4,4,"We purchased the RAV specifically for gas mileage when the price per gallon was near $5.  It has delivered high 20's on the road and around 20mpg in town. Ho-hum. The engine pulls like a freight train and easily tows up to the 3500# limit. Unfortunately, the engineers didn't sort out the torque steer problems under heavy acceleration, it can be very darty. Also, notice the acceleration rate keeps coming on even after I stop pushing on the gas any harder (like a turbo). We bought the Sport to get the darker interior, but the ride quality is too harsh for commuter style driving. And, worst for last, the AT has an irritating whine at 25-35 mph that is louder after warmed up.",High resale value.  Reliability. Only SUV this size and price that was seriously set up to tow 3500# without heroics.  It's a Camry on steroids.  ,"Fix the transmission whine (fluid viscosity?), include auto-off headlights on all models (mine is loaded but missing that? sheesh), redesign tailgate to swing AWAY from curb, make a driver's seat for a full-size American rear, improve the warranty.

I have had to take the car in 4 times and they have put it on the computer and have not been able to duplicate the problem.

It was the best vehicle I ever owned until it hit 850 miles and that's when I could hear a loud constant rattling coming from the dashboard, more specifically the center console. The vehicle was brought back to the dealership 4 times and was never permanently fixed. The master technician, who was great to deal with even replaced my vents in the center dash with a new RAV4 on the sales lot. At times it sounded like a popcorn machine! Finally, a field technical expert from Toy inspected the vehicle and determined that it was A NORMAL OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC! Very disappointed, 1st and last Toyota I'll ever own.","Exterior design, fuel economy, daytime running lights, smooth and comfortable ride ","Toyota needs to improve cheaply made interior, more specifically center console!

We absolutely love the car all around and would definitely recommend it to everybody! MPG are excellent as we are getting 26 on average. Looked into the Escape as well and for a couple thousand more, you get better quality, mileage, and of course, legend reliability. Plenty of room for everyone, got it with the third row for convenience. Tight, but still fine. If you are looking at any comps, just go to the Toyota dealer and buy this car.

Took it on a cross country trip from MA to CA and the car did not disappoint as it was comfortable even during 13 hours/day drives and the engine allowed effortless driving and passing.  Was able to load a lot of contents in the car yet allowed one person to sleep flat in the back. All the safety features incorporated in the car (e.g. VSC, EBD, etc) saved us from a highway catastrophe by a reckless driver in Chicago's south side and allowed us to maintain control. However, tighter brakes and suspension would create more driving confidence. Radio/6-disc CD changer/MP3 player/auxiliary port allows endless forms of audio entertainment!","Powerful and smooth V6 needs only regular gas, Bluetooth, MP3 player, comfortable seats (I am 5'7"") with good driver lumbar support, lots of all around interior space given its exterior size.

Its fun to drive, and I do not regret buying it a bit. 3rd row seat hold my daughters friends for combined mall trips, or lay 'em down and put all her softball stuff there! Its an awesome SUV",3rd row is my fav! Love the extra glove box too. Great idea to put functional cup holders for almost all the seats in the car. Orange lights on radio and cup holders is cool ,Make mud flaps standard on even the base model - you will need them. Change manual seat adjustments - not real versatile. Don't like back door opening like that as well as up. (Had to be this way with the spare though!) make tire cover somehow locking so it wont get stolen.

I decided to finally upgrade it to a new 2008 model with more power for my road trips to Tahoe and the snow. I couldn't be more pleased with the model. The v6 engine provides plenty of power and torque. Love the roomy interior design! Sound system is great. I average about 300 miles per tank. That's a big plus for an SUV of this size. ,"Moon roof, sound system, fold flat rear seats. Bluetooth. ",Better fuel economy for a v6. The spare tire should be inside or under the car body.

5,Amazingly Versatile,sdc2 ,07/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I searched a lot of models before buying the RAV4 six months ago. The RAV4 was the only one I found that: 1) a 6'3"" guy like me could fit into comfortably - I am long torso and headroom is always a challenge, but the height-adjustable seat and telescoping steering wheel did the trick. 2) Properly equipped can tow a modest camper or boat. 3) Would still get into the upper 20s for highway gas mileage. The V6 RAV4 has done all that and more for me. I am getting 22-24 mpg around town and 26-28 highway so far.","Interior room is much bigger than the exterior suggests. The V6 power is fun and helpful when passing on 2-lane highways, with little or no gas mileage penalty compared to 4-cyl. models. Seat is very comfortable. Large storage compartment under the rear deck (without 3rd row seats) is very handy.",Throttle control could be a little less sensitive.

5,A VERY solid SUV to purchase,mkjyoung22 ,07/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"A very good value for your money. This SUV has a ton of power (269 horsepower), and handles exceptionally. The fun factor CANNOT be matched by any vehicle in its class, and probably not by many out of its class. The mileage is very good too, as mine gets 24mpg over all. The interior is comfortable for five people (I am 6ft 3in) and the third row people can sit reasonably comfortable, depending on how you adjust the second row of seats... but is fantastic if you have a few kids. The quality is very solid, the doors seem heavy when you shut them, and the items that are plastic do not have that 'cheap' feel to them. The controls are well placed and very helpful. I am very satisfied overall.","Power and performance, styling, decent gas mileage, third row seats, bluetooth, dual climate control. Did I mention the monstrous performance - it's an SUV...

Full economy is currently about 21.5 avg MPG to 24.5 MPG.  This is driving gently while trying to avoid quick starts and hard stops.  I would like better fuel economy but the RAV is still a best in its class.  I had body moldings installed as I was worried that the unprotected doors would get dinged to easily.,Quick acceleration. Front two cupholders are lighted.  Fold down rear seats.  Sport rims are awesome looking.  Attractive exterior/lines of vehicle.  Two glove boxes.  Number of cupholders. Tow prep package.,Improve interior lighting upon entry. Dark interior and sole dome light provide dim visibility in dark conditions. Footwell lighting should be an option.

Tremendous functionality.  It has the smoothest ride I've ever felt in any truck style vehicle.  If someone tells you it has a harsh or rough ride, they haven't driven it. I have many steep hills where I live and it tackles them with little effort. I'll update this in 3 months.",Cargo space and large hidden compartment space.  Lots of room for a small truck.

After driving the RAV4 there was no comparison. It simply is the best value for the money. I was afraid the RAV4 would be too small compared to the Envoy, but I believe there is actually more room inside the RAV4, and a nicer interior. Ergonomics are great.

Handles well, love the interior, does have a transmission clunk when put into drive in the morning, but otherwise it's great.  I did a lot of research before purchasing this SUV, and I definitely do not regret it.

We are averaging about 25 mpg in mixed driving and even got 28 mpg on a recent trip. I am convinced that this is the best SUV in its class!","Barcellona Red Metallic color. V6 engine. 17"" wheels. Roof rack.",Make fog lights available. My wife would like to have a compass also.
5,Great Vehicle,garyp ,04/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this 3 weeks ago and have enjoyed every minute I have spent in it.  It is really quick, very nimble, very roomy and very comfortable. The ride is very comfortable and secure, both at freeway speeds and on curvy country roads. The first 2 tanks of gas are averaging over 25 mpg and should only get better.  I traded a large Buick Rendezvous for the Rav and am much happier with the Rav.  Plenty of storage and easy access.  Easy entrance and exit to/from both front and rear seats also. ","Quickness, handling, comfort, fuel economy.",None so far.
5,Gotta Try it,greg cain ,04/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Over the past 9 years I have purchased 4 Toyota products and this one is by far the best. My last purchase was a 2004 Highlander which my wife and I really enjoyed. You can't beat the overall performance of the engine and transmission. It actually feels like the vehicle is not running and at the same time just wants to take off. Outstanding performance. Ample room and at the same time, I can't see a whole lot of difference between this and the Highlander I owned. Our first choice was the Limited addition but chose the sport because of the darker seats and dash.","Looks, the storage in the rear, performance and Toyota quality. Not sure why everyone has to knock the back door. Putting the tire on the outside gives the RAV best in class in storage.",Get rid of the bland grey. Put heated cloth seats like your competition and a trip computer. Would buy one again in a minute.
4.25,It is what it is,jsandy1 ,04/14/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,5,4,4,5,Pros: lots of power; fun to drive; shiftronic transmission; roomy interior; excellent AC; great JBL stereo-the bluetooth feature is excellent; very good gas mileage so far; good quality leather interior. Rear reclining seats on an adjustable track. Moonroof is a nice feature.  Cons: center console needs to he higher for use as an armrest; no AC blower control on steering wheel; clock hard to see; trip computer is very mediocre-need to improve; Home Link should be offered at least as an option. Cargo net in rear is cumbersome.,Lots of power; fun to drive; shiftronic transmission.,No AC blower control on steering wheel; clock hard to see; trip computer is very mediocre.
4.5,The RAV is cool,mike ,04/10/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"My wife wanted a new vehicle after driving minivans for the last fifteen years. Gas mileage was a big factor as was the fact she wanted a small suv and something sporty. All those factors took us to the RAV.

4.375,2008 RAV4,jb ,04/04/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"I just got married and wanted something slightly bigger than a sedan (previous car was a 1994 Accord coupe).  We test drove the Rogue, CR-V, Tucson, Vibe, and RAV4.  We wanted something that was versatile, reliable, and gets good mileage.  The 4-cyl gives good acceleration, but can be noisy.  Leg room is good enough (I'm 6'1"").  We live in a snowy climate but don't need the AWD.  Very happy so far, would buy again.","Fuel economy (avg. 25 mpg), cargo room, styling, reliability.","Stock stereo, manual transmission option, 5 speed AT for 4cyl, vertical opening rear door, ability to open rear glass window, more leg room."
4.75,What fun!,Love it ,03/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I love the way this vehicle handles.  It is quite nimble and quick. In the V6 model acceleration is better (much better) than I had with a V8 Explorer. Interior room is very satisfactory allowing me to have my large breed dog crate in the back without issue and to also offer room to the other dogs. It is fun to drive!!  We did some off road driving yesterday through mud, up hills and over some rough terrain. I have the V6 Ltd model and am very pleased so far. I am small so the seats work well for me as does the rest of the car. The best thing about this SUV is the handling. It is so fast out of the starting blocks it was tough to get used to. Turning radius is on a dime. Stopping on a dime OK.","Handling, quickness and nimble. Interior space.  I have large breed dogs and it's tough to fit them all into a vehicle.  I can fit my Pyr and Lab in there, without a problem. The gas mileage is very good so far -26 MPG. Comfort is good. I can fit large folks in this car without problem.",Center console is too low. I like an elbow rest. Clock display is invisible with sunglasses on! Advertising of the Metallic Green color is very deceptive.

4,Upholstery problems,sewsue ,03/19/2008,,,1,4,2,5,,5,5,5,5,"Purchased my base model 2008 RAV4 at the end of October.  Love everything about it except the upholstery.  At 3 months old and under 5500 miles, the fabric on the seats and on the door panels is starting to pill and fuzz. Toyota tells me this is ""normal wear and tear"".  Thankfully my dealer disagrees.  They are trying to find me matching fabric.  Glad I no longer have kids and their gear to haul around.  The interior would not survive.  Wish now that I had chosen the Limited trim level with leather seats.  ",The single lever fold flat seats and all the storage areas.,Better fabric for the interior.
4.75,Love what it does for me,Bradley Jordan ,03/18/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I just bought my RAV4 yesterday. I was reluctant to buy it as a RAV4 had been labeled a girls' car but the style and look have changed my mind. My gas mileage is actully better than my 2000 Civic right now. I plan on filling up at a quarter of a tank instead at the true empty.    I am quite happy with it. Love the storage bins under the floor. I will propbly drive this car into the ground like my CIvic and Camry.    I would definitely recommend it. I got tinted windows and the luggage rack.  ,"Storage under the floor in the back, easy fold down back seats, nice design","Work on the gas mileage, better dash board computer, ""miles left on tank of gas"" display.

4.5,2008 Rav4 V6,Max ,03/14/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,5,5,4,5,We traded in our sports car for the new RAV4.  Our hope was to achieve the gas mileage abilities of our Nissan Maxima (family car) while gaining a more versatile vehicle.  We did have one noise issue that was hard to track down since it would only happen at freeway speeds.  The source of the noise was the roof rack cross member (it was loose).  This caused a noise as it shifted position due to wind speed pushing it backward.  The 2nd noise source was a loose radio antenna.  We are averaging between 22.5-24 MPG in mixed driving (65%+ city) with the V6. Our RAV has just over 1000 miles on it and I suspect the MPG will be increasing.  ,"V6, height adjustable drivers seat.",Allow for OEM fog lights installation after purchase.

5,Excellent vehicle. Good job Toyota Japan,sammy b ,03/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got my Rav4 v6 4wd sport last week and I love it. It is built very well, and performs great at acceleration and handling. It gets very good mileage for 269hp v6 w/4wd. Stable at high speeds, comfortable, looks good, fits perfect in my garage, what else is there to say.

4.75,Great Winter Ride,Lila Sterling ,02/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I've had the car about a month and put on over 1,000 miles. I sold my Saab 9-5 wagon when it would not go up the driveway of our new home. The RAV has NO problem going up a very steep incline in ice and snow. It does make the ""beep"" sound to let me know that it is adjusting for slippage. I test drove it hard to make sure it could handle Catskill Mountain weather and it has proven to be just what it promised. Mine has ""down hill assist"" which I like because sometimes I have to go to work before the local plow person comes to our driveway and it really does help. Also there is LOTS of storage space. I picked up two big chairs for a friend and they went right in.",I feel very safe with the TRAC system. The height of the ride is really nice. It has a tight steering wheel.,"Gas mileage is only fair. I get about 20 miles to the gallon. I know it's a trade off for 6 cylinders, but they did a hybrid for the Highlander - now the RAV needs one. Highway is a bit better, but I bought the car for the windy back roads."
5,Awesome,ghana ,02/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Still breaking this car in, have only driven about 250 miles, but am totally impressed with the entire package.  Fast, responsive, comfortable, quiet, good visibility, spacious, tight handling, great looking, nice riding, solid car.  Cruising at 70 mph, and tach only reads about 2000 rpm.  My old car, a v6 also, used to read 3000 rpm.  I live in the U.K. where sometimes it's better/safer to drive on the freeways fast (80mph+).  I used to be a little concerned about motor wear in my old car. I don't think I'll have to be concerned about it anymore.  I don't think that the 5 speed auto trans has any big issues. The V6 version is the best.","The V6 power, cup holders (10), rear storage space under the cargo floor, double glove box, two compartment center console, 18"" mag wheels, space at the rear.","Gas tank only 60 litres, maybe 70 would be about right.

5,RAV4 handles well in the mountains,MAC ,01/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased the '08 RAV4 Sport V6 AWD right before the snow season. I drive on snow/ice covered roads regularly.  The car handles well and rarely slips as I go up and down steep hills and around tight curves usually in 2-6 inches of snow at roughly 35 mph.  I have not needed to use the lock-in feature for 4WD but it's nice to know it's available if snow gets too deep.  On dry pavement, the RAV4 feels like a car.  It's not bouncy like a truck frame 4WD and gets far better gas mileage. Plus, it really holds true speed with speed control engaged.  No drift acceleration or deceleration through mountainous terrain.  Fun to drive.  ","Telescoping steering wheel, simple controls, lots of storage (particularly the under-floor trunk), back seat large enough for tall and big adults (front seat less so), good head room, fold flat rear seating.",1. A lock button on the gear shift so you cannot accidentally knock the transmission to neutral or 4th.  2. An audible alarm if you leave the lights on.  3.

I've already tested the PSI warning light as I had a nail in the tire within a few days of purchasing.  Had the light not gone on, I suspect I would have had a flat tire vs. being able to check it out before it went completely flat.  Engine very quiet - to the point it sounds like it stalled.  It's the perfect size - takes up the same space in the garage as my Volvo S70 - maybe even a little less space.  ","Everything- love the iPod connection; Bluetooth setup was a breeze and using it is easy as well.  NEVER thought I'd use heated seats in CA, but I haven't shut them off since I got the car. Tons of space!",Seat positioning memory - at least one but even better if two.  Wish I could advance iPod songs like you do CD tracks.  PSI warning should tell you which tire - sometimes it is not that obvious (as I recently experienced). Light in glove compartment.  Better user manual.
4.625,Best of class,Engineer ,01/06/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I've owned the 6-cylinder Ltd version since November 07.  It's a lot of fun to drive.  The power of the V6 is amazing, and likewise the stopping ability is great, too.  It corners very well, with a surprisingly tight turning radius, making it very easy to park.  It has excellent visibility, which makes it easy to back out of a parking space. The dual climate controls work much better that the dual climate controls in my American-brand sedan.  The side-opening rear door makes it easy for my 5-foot tall wife to load groceries and close the door afterwards.  The 8-way adjustable seat gives her a good view of the road.   She loves the car.","I love the easy-drop-down rear seat feature.  I also like the cockpit layout.  The controls seem very logically placed, so I can just take a quick glance to change a control setting.  I also really like the high-bright lighting of the controls for daytime visibility.","Keep the cockpit as is.  (No faux wood-grain.) The seats are way too firm.  The seat backs are especially stiff, which can be uncomfortable if you have a sore back and have a long drive to make.  The suspension is a bit too stiff as well.

We've run from NYC to Boston and back twice, one of those trips in the thick of the recent snowstorm.  The AWD plowed through several inches of fresh snow (the electronic AWD lock being a very useful feature when the plows haven't come through yet).  Having a V6 gives added confidence, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this car.   I'm 6'2"" and quite comfortable up front.  I have 4 kids under age 7, so the optional third row gets used at weekends.  It's a little tight back there - cargo space pretty much disappears with the third row up & in use.  When the kids are older we'll go for a Sienna. ","AWD is handy in the snowy northeast, very peppy V6, surprisingly roomy interior with the 3rd row stowed into the floor.

It's like driving a peppy little sports car that sits high off the ground.  The vehicle is well engineered and the traction control and 4wd provide impressive handling in the snow.

What impressed me was the tremendous acceleration of the V6, the safety features and the ""on demand"" 4WD system. No more locking in hubs or shifting into 4WD. It took a while getting use to the different configuration of the stick shift. There is good visibility out the front windshield due to the short angled hood.

Plenty of power to fool around on the road, handling is just like a car, gas consumption is impressive for a 3500 lbs crossover SUV(got average of 21 miles/gal). Design of the interior is as good as sedan but too much plastic materials used. Toyota did a good job to fool your eyes (you'll think it's a leatherette from a distance).

The drive is very quiet, the ride smooth and handling is great.  I traded a Jeep Liberty and besides getting me out of my 300 ft driveway in 8"" of snow, I loved the turning radius.  It would turn on a dime getting into parking spots. The RAV does too. One of the reasons I bought the RAV was for the gas mileage.  Of course anything is better on gas than the Liberty. I also wanted a RAV because of the safety features. We've had 2 Toyotas in our family and would have literally driven them into the ground; they were built so well. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a great SUV!","I'm probably one of a few people who like the side opening back door! Also like the foot lighting, the BT and the stereo system. There's plenty of big & little storage places. One of my main considerations is the safety features.","Pricing maybe, but it's true; you get what you pay for. And this RAV was worth every penny.

Based on the MPG, reliability, looks and price the RAV4 edged out the Honda CR-V. Now that I have had the car for several weeks I am thrilled that I decided on the RAV4. The V6 is surprisingly powerful and quick for the MPG that you actually get. We are averaging 25.3 MPG so far.  The sport model has larger rims and tires with fender well moldings that really make a difference in the overall look of the vehicle. The interior is very well thought out and convenient.

As soon as you start your car your call gets transferred to your car speaker and built in mic. Hands-free driver. No need to turn off or lower the volume, it will switch automatically to call when you receive a call too. Extra storage in the trunk. Cargo net and other good stuff is awesome.","Built in Bluetooth phone. Extra space below trunk, as spare tire is outside. Speakers including subwoofer.",
4.75,Great small SUV,NorthernMD ,11/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,4,"Not a lot of miles yet. Very tight car. V6 has excessive power, very quick. Have had 5 people in the car with no lack of pep. Last tank 23 mpg, 65% city, 35% highway. Sport trim has the best look. Road noise, wind, etc is as I expected for this type of car but still very quiet (I don't usually turn on the stereo for short trips). So far it matches up to my pre-purchase research. ","Exterior styling, quickness and gas mileage.","A little bigger... well, that's the Highlander isn't it."
3.375,Malfunction at 90 miles,wpenny ,11/04/2007,,,3,4,4,1,,4,4,3,4,"I am disappointed with the 2008 Rav4.  I turned a corner last night, pressed on the gas and the car jerked and three major malfunction indicator lights came on (4WD, VSC and a lamp).  Toyota does not know what the codes are and needs to contact Toyota engineering.  3-weeks old and malfunctions.  Should have stuck with the Camry",,
5,Fun to drive,Bob in WA ,11/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The 2008 limited RAV4 with the V6 is a winning combination. The drive is superb, the dual control temperature is a great feature, saves arguments on the right temperatures. The performance of the V6 will impress even the most skeptical driver. Steering is very responsive and all around this is a high quality fun vehicle to drive.","The dual temperature control, the high performance V6 and the quality leather interior.",Cruise control switch should be moved and redesigned.
5,Awesome SUV!,Ronn ,10/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased my new 2008 RAV4 yesterday, and what fun it is! The quality, fit and finish is excellent! I am 6'2, and have plenty of legroom. I find the V6 to be very smooth, and the cabin to be very quiet for an SUV. The leather seats are firm, but still comfortable.  There is plenty of storage space, and easy access with the fold-down back seats. The options with the Limited are wonderful, and everything is easy to reach on the dash. The exterior is very sporty, and I love the new Savannah color. It is beautiful on this SUV. The safety features saved on my insurance. I added the exhaust tip, rear bumper applique, mudguards, and XM radio which is awesome with the premium 9 speakers!          "," The great handling and looks, XM radio with premium JBL 9 speaker and subwoofer, powerful and smooth V6, plenty of storage with fold down seating, daytime running lights, and beautiful Savannah color, all the standard options with the limited. Fun to drive.","Add homelink, antenna in windshield, bigger gas tank. "
2.125,2008 Rav4 - rough ride,Lee ,10/16/2007,,,1,2,2,4,,2,1,3,2,"Just bought a 2008 Rav4 4cyl fwd, base model  with  a few extras.  A friend has an 05 and loves it; another has one of the  original Ravs and loves it.  Something must have changed.  You can  really,  really feel the road; very rough ride.  Seats are very uncomfortable.  The interior is new milenium plastic.  The car has an unexplained ""clink"" on shifting, exceleration and braking. Burned plastic smell (like I picked up a plastic bag on the muffler - hope that goes away).  Really disappointing ride","New car smell.  Which is only temporary, of course.",Don't even know where to begin.  Needs comprehensive design overhaul
