Fuel door wouldn't open yesterday, and my gas light was on.  Scheduled to get it fixed this Sat.  Now my passenger door won't open with the remote or the button inside.  Great.

Needs not to have all those things happen listed in my review.  Oh, also had to have the windshield wiper arm replaced on driver's side.  It decided not to work after 2 mos.  This can was in supposed ""mint"" condition when I bought it.  It had not one ding or scratch in its black paint.  It passed the 90 pt. inspection.  What a nightmare.

So far, I've liked this car; it's comfortable and has been reliable, except that I've had some issues with the tires...one a nail picked up and another tire had a rim that was coming away..Very strange. The big downsides for me are: the gas mileage, no automatic hatch opener and it's very hard for a short person to close the hatch.

We bought ours new, and the engine eats oil. Dealer said the engine was 'breaking in'. I am now at 20k on the car, and it eats 1.5 to 2 qts per 1000 miles. Dealer will not help. Also, the A/C is weak. It is barely ok for the front, but on a 5 passenger, there is no rear air. My kids hate it, always hot.

The handling of the AWD Tribeca is darn near neutral and the turn in spot on. its fun to drive and comfortable on road trips or in town. The interior and exterior looks compliment each other. I use the transmission in sport mode all the time, either leaving it in drive or shifting up and down. the engine is a lot more responsive & mileage doesn't seem to suffer. One thing that bugs me is that the transmission shifting seems out of sync with the engine at times. The Tribeca doubles well as a tent and carries a lot of ""stuff"". I don't like the puddle lights though but that's a nil point IMO. Next thing is XM radio.","Handling, ride. Shape & profile. 18"" wheels and low aspect tires.

4.25,Mixed Bag,Mr. Subaru ,10/29/2008,,,5,3,5,5,,4,5,2,5,"The 08 Tribeca is a mix of great features and questionable design components. The Tribeca is solidly built and handles like a car. The engine is powerful, and the transmission shifts smoothly. Steering and braking are crisp. The cargo area is surprisingly small for a vehicle this size, a tight fit for dogs. The gas mileage is poor (17 mpg mixed) compared to other vehicles in this category, and is compounded by a small gas tank which results in a VERY, VERY short driving range. I was spoiled by my 06 Outback's 500 mile range.  The thick A pillar makes turning corners a challenge if pedestrians are present.   ","AWD, interior design, front seats, powerful engine, smooth shifting transmission. Engine uses regular gas unlike earlier models which used premium.

Subaru has shown no interest in addressing my issues.  I was looking to install blue-tooth which is not a factory option.  The proprietary cd/radio has made that challenging.  Lots of noise in the cabin while driving.  The ride is not as firm as the BMW X5.  The back-up camera is a very nice feature and the heated seats work well.

I have always driven Acura vehicles over the last 10 years but was turned off to the high cost of the MDX. I test drove the GMC Acadia, Buick Enclave,Toyota Highlander, and MDX.

This a fun car to drive, room for kids and cargo, AWD, and we like the design. We got the gold color with tan leather. Even in the sun all day, it doesn't get that hot inside.

I love the interior and features but I don't care for the ride. It is very bumpy and I am sensitive to motion. The Toyota gave a much much better ride and I am sorry I didn't buy it out of the lease. I was swayed by the features I didn't have in the Highlander like heated seats, memory  seats, outside temp reading, etc. The insurance is a fortune-my bad for not checking. They say it is because it costs so much to fix and the excise tax is very high which I didn't factor in. Factor in all your costs before making this purchase!

It handles like a smaller vehicle, is very secure feeling, and comfortable (except for adults in the third row, but we knew this when we bought it - it is fine for children.

We were looking at the Honda Pilot(booring look), Toyota Higlander Hybrid(cheapo interior, drives like truck), GMC Acadia(drives like a bigger gas guzzling truck),Acura MDX (liked this but not as much as the Subaru for lots of little reasons not to mention value).  The Tribeca immediately stood out.  The build quality is excellent.  The vehicle exudes confidence between the engine, all-wheel-drive, skid control, and all of the other safety features.  The flat engine is extremely smooth even during hard acceleration(almost flooring it). The 3rd row is a little cramped but we only have 2 kids and aren't going cross-country in it either. Great car!","Unique car in traffic, great interior/exterior design, engine, build quality top notch.",Fuel economy is decent for an AWD vehicle but should be improved. Hybrid maybe?

In city - 17 to 18 which is as advertised.  Highway only trips 22 - 24.  We have had a Land Rover Discovery, Acura MDX, Mercedes ML 320 and Volvo XC70 - this vehicle is every bit as good and much less expensive.  Because of those other SUVs I was smart enough to not get the built in Navi.  Spent $250 on a Garmin.  Almost bought BMW X5 but decided to save $20K - glad I did.","AWD is great in snow/ice.  Like you would expect in a Subaru.  Ipod port, interior styling.  New front end for 2008 as well as the bigger engine.  Great value for the dollars spent.",Only 2 improvements - a bigger gas tank.

4.875,Hidden Gem,Baystar ,01/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded in my 2003 Audi A4 Avant because it was so unreliable. The Tribeca is a hidden gem, it has a great ride and all the features of a Lexus RX but costs $12,000 less. While the critics complain about lack of space in rear rows that only applies to the 7 seater, the 5 seater has plenty of leg room. I think Subaru should stop trying to market the Tribeca as a 7 seater. Mileage could be better, but it helps that the Tribeca runs on regular gas. Handling is good enough that I don't miss the Audi. The overall ride is quiet, smooth and feels very sophisticated. The stereo is very good and helps make the commute highly enjoyable. The nav system has worked fine for me thus far. ","The rear view camera, puddle lights, large side mirrors. Subaru's reliability. Stylish interior.

That caused me to research more and I found the Tribeca with a six cylinder engine instead of a turbocharged 4 cylinder and I never looked back.  I've now had the car 3 months and I am very happy the Acura dealers were shortsighted.  The Tribeca is the most fun to drive of any car I have ever owned and I've owned quite a few.  It corners and holds the road like a sports car.  The ""toys"" radio, gps, sound sys are excellent.  The backup camera is great, especially at night.  Mileage is average, in the 18 to 20 range.

I previously drove a Cadillac STS, and wanted a comfortable, sporty ride, that didn't require me to sit so low to the ground.  My Tribeca is very comfortable, sporty (for this kind of vehicle), and versatile with the room in back and fold down seats.  The nav system is inconsistent - sometimes it's great, others, like a trip to central OH last week, it wants to send you 100 miles out of your way.  Gas mileage could be better. The 2008 model is good looking, with a smooth engine and terrific all wheel drive at a nice price. It also has lots of storage, cup holders and power ports for family use. Put this on your short list!   ","Comfort, room, handsome leather interior, Subaru's all wheel drive and reputation for reliability and safety.  Lots of versatility, including cupholders and bins.

Has a comfortable yet peppy driving response, good pickup in the city. This is my first Subaru purchase after years of VW driving, but I don't think it will be my last.

The fit and finish of the car is superb. The interior is quite roomy both front and rear, and I like the styling. I looked at BMW and Lexus, and I bought the Subaru. To my taste, the exterior looks just like every other crossover. It's nice, but not distinctive. The interior has high style and comfort. It handles very well, and has just the right amount of power. Braking is spectacular. I am not comfortable with the way the transmission shifts, particularly on hills. ","Rear backup camera, it's a must. Climate controls, and panel ambient lighting. Heated seats that are downright therapeutic.","The $2000 nav system is a complete waste of money. I have used nav for 10 years, and this is virtually useless.

I 'test drove' a few friends who own them and could feel the solidness of the vehicle. Since I don't buy new cars every few years (previously drove a '97 Blazer) I wanted to make sure this was the  car for me. It is. Reading the reports on  Subaru's reliability also moved me into purchasing it. Size wise, it's perfect.  Not too big or small.   Driving the Tribeca one can feel the responsiveness of it. A good, linear feel, like you are on rails, plus  great stopping power. Good road feel too. Not too soft or harsh. Like Goldilocks' porridge, just right! Plus quick acceleration when stomped on.",The ambient lighting. I thought it'd be hokey. It isn't. Rear view mirrors take in a wide area of viewing. Nice for passing.  The exterior design doesn't draw much attention. Somewhat bland. But that's ok with me. Who needs attention?  ,"I like to drive resting my elbows. It's difficult to find a comfort point like I did with my Blazer. The door rest is a wee bit too low. And the right arm console is too short. I guess I need to grow longer arms.

4.625,"Smooth, quiet, classy AWD",MN tribeca ,08/23/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Have wanted a larger Subaru for years, first Tribeca was too ugly and underpowered for me. The new Tribeca is very quiet and smooth with plenty of power from the new engine. Getting 19-20 mpg in mixed driving, as high as 24 mpg on 2-lane highway at 60 mph. New tranny is very smooth, as is power delivery. New exterior was what I had been wanting, kind of bland grille but better than the fish-mouth of last year. Good handling for a crossover, ride is sweet, overall very impressed.  Boxer engine/AWD combo hard to beat.  ","Boxer engine, low cg, unique and stylish interior, Subaru durability, quality and reliability. Better than expected mpg. Lots of leg room for tall people. Smooth and quiet engine and tranny. Has ten airbags, five star crash ratings, with VDC stability control, should be very safe. 87 octane!","Steering wheel is a ways away when you slide seat back, could have telescopic column for tall drivers. No mirror memory to go with seat memory. Stereo is only OK. Mirrors seem to be at an angle. Tires OK at best. 16.9 gallon fuel tank not big enough."
4.75,Great luxury bang for the buck,gvo ,07/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"'08 Tribeca is head and shoulders above the underpowered '07 model with ugly front looks. The drive is smooth, the design and build quality are great. It's a hungry beast, though - I can't get more than 17 mpg out of it. Other than that, beautiful car, and I am very happy with it.",,
4.875,I'm impressed,Suzy B. ,07/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just drove the new 08 Tribeca.  While cleaning my house and finding the Subaru magazine, I looked through it and found out about all the new changes of the 08 Tribeca.  I own a 06 tribeca and have always been disapointed with the engine and transmission.  So, went to town and drove the 08 and found the difference to be very very noticable within the first few seconds of driving it. I went back the next day and purchased the new 2008 Tribeca.  I love all the great changes.  Thanks Subaru!!","The new engine and transmission.  Plus the iPod plug in.  Oh yes and running on normal unleaded gasoline, not the premium like the 06.","I only have 60 miles on mine, so can't think of any right now."
4.75,The B9 is fine,Cliff Wallick  ,06/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"We found the 2008 Tribeca to be superior in design and performance than any other vehicle in its price range!  It's quiet, smooth, roomy and stylish, what more would you want?  Did I mention it was also fun?  It compares best to Acura and Lexus.  Tremendous value!    ",Interior design and sportshift option.,Maybe a hybrid version?
