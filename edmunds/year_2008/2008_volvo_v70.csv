5,Wagon Love,Dan De Angelis ,08/31/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,"I held off on my review until we had several thousand miles logged in the car and a few service intervals. This isn’t our first Volvo as we have had 240’s, 740’s and S70’s through the years. Along with Volvos we have owned everything from Mini Vans to Mercedes, approximately 55 vehicles in all.I was attracted to the V70 because of styling, performance and the need for cargo space. All of which have been fulfilled with this car. We found this previously owned with 48,000 gentle one owner mi. and all service records up to date. We have taken several road trips thus far and use as a commuter during the week. Absolutely no disappointments at all and I enjoy driving a vehicle that doesn’t  look like the majority of vehicles on the road. Other reviewers have a tendency to compare this to vehicles that out perform and out handle the V70 but they miss the essence entirely. This wagon has plenty of power provided by the 3.2 Litre ( same motor in the LR1 Land Rover) and delivers well when called upon. The comfort is second to none and the fit and finish throughout the vehicle is way above the standard run of the mill cars for the masses.Our V70 is the silver metallic sans the luggage rack with 6 spoke 16” wheels. It’s amazing how many people compliment on the looks and the younger gen love it! Kinda cool for a station wagon huh ?I will be adding Bilstein HD Struts and Shocks along with rear stabilizer bar soon for ride and sound improvements but that’s it. We continue to service at all intervals and to this point have absolutely no complaints. Go find a well kept V70 and stand out!20K addl. mile update:Still the one! Replaced motor mounts because of quick deterioration due to driving on brick residential roads and thats been it. The bricks got to the brick!Still quiet, comfortable and turning heads! Interesting to see a Bentley wagon now. Could this be the new statement vehicle?",,
5,Excellant alternative to boorish SUV,steveheckman ,01/24/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"What the reviewers at Edmunds [and elsewhere] don't seem to grasp, is that many of us don't like the ""me too"" look and feel of an elevated SUV.Volvo and other EU manufactures offer a sporty driving experience in a very practical design - a station wagon. Not trendy...which is a characteristic that I appreciate. In an era dominated by overweight SUVs and their ""cross-over"" cousins, the Volvo V70 is a sign of sanity and good taste. If you need an elevated drivers seat to feel important, the V70 is not for you. If you drive with one eye on your cell phone and your brain firmly rooted in cyber-space, please stay in your SUV, and I'll keep an eye out for you.","Ride quality and handling - this is not your Mom's station wagon, or for that matter, your kids SUV.

Great seats and a quiet cabin...what else do I need? The controls are simple and easy to use...none of that over techie nonsense that BMW/Audi/Mercedes like to push as ""21st Century improvements"" that only complicate your life.

The styling is very upscale with none of the ""look at me"" bling found on many Japanese/Korean or American brands, and now unfortunately seeping into German design.","I haven't found any after 30k miles, but I'll keep looking. Perhaps that now Ford is out of the way, the new owners will keep Volvo as a unique brand in a world full of ""me-too"" designs that appeal to base impulses."
4.625,A good old traditional station wagon,Steve in Minnesota ,02/11/2010,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,4,"Interior comfort is the best feature of the V70.  There is plenty of space for both passengers and cargo in a relatively compact package.  The power train is generally refined.  The transmission is very smooth but the engine growls a tad too loud for an almost 40,000 car.  There is way too much shudder and noise when going over bumps but otherwise it feels solid. The highway ride is quiet and serene.  We purchased for 25 grand as a rental return. I believe the MSRP was about 38 grand, which is a little spendy.  We're getting 22-34 mpg in mixed driving.  The heated seats are the best I have ever felt.  Very welcome in Minnesota. ","Excellent heated seats, solid feeling, seat comfort, overall practical design.","Suspension needs to be a little quieter on large bumps(potholes).  Gauges seems to be lit by a reading lamp.  Should be backlit like other cars, perhaps in ice blue.  "
4.5,Car is great but possible improvements,aef83a ,06/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"This is not a typical station wagon.  The handling is not like that of a sports sedan but it works for what this vehicle is.  You will appreciate the comfort and convenience that the V70 provides, and although I have yet to see proof I hope that it is safe as well.","IPOD jack, stereo, seat comfort, smooth power from drivetrain","handling a bit wallowy in corners, standard heated seats and xenon headlights, better fuel economy."
5,"subtle, sophisticated, and fun",judith ,05/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Swapped for an E320 -- 1"" shorter and cavernous in the back, which I don't notice while I am having so much fun in these wonderful front seats, wheeling a surprisingly sporty but beautiful driver cabin.  Drives like a high-end sport sedan.",Seating and safety is a given.  Pleasantly surprised by the pickup - 6 cylinder is much more fun than the mercedes.,Can't think of a thing.
4.875,A great alternative to an SUV,John ,02/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've put 6,500 miles on this car over the past 6 months and have been very pleased. It replaced a Lexus LS430 and an older Volvo V70. The ride quality is smooth and quiet. While I really enjoyed the super-quiet ride and precise handling of the Lexus, I am also enjoying the sportier driving experience of this Volvo. I much prefer this car to the roughness and sway of the SUV's I have owned. Based on the car's computer readout, fuel mileage is considerably better than the EPA numbers (30 - 32 MPG at 60 MPH). Build quality seems good with no significant problems so far.  ","Personal Car Communicator/keyless start, power lift gate, blind spot information system, Volvo towing package (expensive but worth it)","Rubber bumpers between body and lift gate tend to squeak (occasional WD-40 stops it), Sirius radio loses signal in wooded areas"
4.25,A classic wagon (with great seats),Peter ,02/05/2009,,,5,4,5,4,,4,5,3,4,"This isn't necessarily a ""fun"" car, but it is comfortable, quiet and practical.  I think it makes a lot of sense for a family that needs something big enough for kids and gear, but isn't interested in a minivan or SUV.  The interior is beautifully designed and assembled.  It is one of those cars where almost every design decision appears to have been driven by a lot of thought about ergonomics.  Materials are generally high quality.  While the base price might be 32K, it is difficult to find one without a lot of options (and a much higher MSRP). However, I was able to get a ""left- over"" 2008 at a bit over 25 percent off.  I have had this car for only two weeks, so ignore my reliability score.","The seats, blind spot information system (an option), smooth and quiet driving, the incredibly well thought- out trunk compartment ","It's a station wagon, but gas mileage is only marginally better than a mini- van.  While the base engine (3.2 6 cyl.) is adequate and very smooth, it generally doesn't feel powerful.  I would like to know where the extra gas is going... FM reception isn't great."
5,Great Automobile,Wally ,10/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,A lot of fun to drive. Great handling. Excellent braking. Beautiful interior - very comfortable. This is my 7th Volvo and I'm not disappointed. Very classy exterior styling. With freeway driving I'm getting between 27 and 30.5 mpg.,"Handing, comfort and styling. Very pleased with the gas mileage.",Center console is difficult to close when driving. The GPS system would be better if it had a touch screen.
4.5,V70 Just Arriving from Europe,"Randall S Over, P.E. ",07/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"Picked up the car in Gothenburg, Sweden and drove 1800 miles through Europe. Very easy to handle, beautiful interior, typical great seats and well laid out dash, switches, gauges, etc. Evolutionary update to the design of my S60. If anyone is thinking of the European delivery program, do it, well worth it even with the current value of the US dollar vs the Euro and SEK.","Roominess, interior and exterior looks and ease of parking and steering given the size. Very comfortable and easy to drive.","Smaller engine with turbo, better mileage. However, we got between 24-25 miles/gallon going well, fast on the highways in Europe, with 4 people and gear. I expect similar mileage here in the states."
4.875,Well pleased,Mike ,05/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"This car is what you would expect from Volvo. Understated performance, design with good handling.  This is my second Volvo wagon, previous 240. I love the wagon for the car ride with the hauling of a suv.  Pleased with fuel economy. I commute 70 miles round trip daily on interstates and average 26 mpg.",Seats are outstanding. Lift gate gives great access to rear.,Some annoying road noise.
4.875,Very pleased,Bill ,03/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have owned the car for three (3) months now and have been very pleased. I was looking for a vehicle that would be capable of towing a small pop-up camper, yet not be as bulky as an SUV - a station wagon was a good solution, and the car is very comfortable. As I was previously a Honda owner, fuel economy has been disappointing, but not unexpected. I average 22 to 23 mpg with my city driving and a tad over 25 mpg on the highway - not too bad all things considered, but I do use high octane fuel.","The vehicle is comfortable - even for a 6'4"", all legs person. The interior is well appointed without being over the top and I do like the exterior styling. Others seem to find it pleasing as well.","My biggest concern is fuel economy, but as stated above, it is not unexpected, but something Volvo needs to develop more fuel efficient vehicles. I am hoping (and trusting) that my 2008 model has the reliability of the older Volvos."
4.25,Great so far,TrackAHolic ,03/20/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,3,5,4,4,"Bought to replace Dodge Dakota Quad Cab after having baby.  Compared mostly against Dodge Magnum and BMW Sportswagon. Volvo had nicest interior and was reasonably roomy. Dodge had most room and great performance, but wife didn't like the styling. BMW had best cornering and steering feel, but was a little small. Car will be used for long cruises and day-to-day driving, so it was a perfect fit. Driving dynamics are sloppy, but it still has good overall grip and acceleration. The interior is beautiful, and really helped sell us on the car. It is a pleasure on any kind of drive, has a great stereo, is quiet, and roomy.  I really like to drive it, and I typically drive a 350Z.","Interior design. Exterior styling. Ipod interface cable (expensive but useful for ""active listeners"") Personal Car Communicator  My rating may seem low due to driving performance, but I want to emphasize that the car is great for most driving and I expect it to be fantastic for longer trips.","We've been getting about 22 MPG is city traffic, respectable, but seems a little low give the power. Slightly sportier ride with better steering feel. Nervous about reliability and long term value. Older Volvos were bulletproof, but newer ones make me wonder. Keeping my fingers crossed."
4.875,Nicely Appointed,Phil ,03/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've had the car for two weeks, I am very satisfied with the vehicle, it's got lots of pep, is very stable in snow and ice, is rock solid on dry pavement, very tight steering, very little torque steer, great in tight turns at speed, a quiet and enjoyable ride.  I'm getting 21.5 in mixed driving, I burn mid grade fuel.      ","The radio sounds awesome!, comfortable seats, nice options, I have Sirius, leather, PCC, moonroof.","Volvo accessories are really expensive!, like Bluetooth and iPod interface."
4.75,Safety First,Lori ,01/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I've only had the car for a month, so it's difficult to rate reliability.  I purchased the vehicle primarily based on safety and I did a lot of research on safety in determining what to buy.  When it comes to safety, the V70 is a vehicle in which I feel comfortable transporting my golden retriever and passengers, particularly back seat passengers.  The vehicle feels as solid as an SUV without the gas mileage and top heaviness. It's a car I hope to have for years to come.",Comfort and safety.,"Better visibility.  Perhaps better fuel economy, although I am averaging 21.6 miles/per gallon driving more city than highway miles."
