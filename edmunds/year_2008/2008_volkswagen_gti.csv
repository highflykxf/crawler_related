4,Great performance. Poor reliabilty,David Lynch ,06/24/2016,3,4,4,,,1,3,5,3,,,"This car has phenomenal performance, but man does it have things go wrong with it.  A few things you should know of you buy this car.  You're going to replace the coil packs on this car every 30-40K miles and when the first one goes, replace them all.  In fact, carry a spare in your car at all times along with a code reader.  When you get a misfire, read the code, find out which cylinder it is and replace it yourself.  Here is a list of all the things I've had to replace since I bought the car with 21K miles on it (it has 54K now):  4 coil packs, 4 spark plugs, 1 thermostat, 1 vacuum pump, 1 intake line, 1 headlight bulb and both headlight auto-leveling motors.  I haven't even had to replace the brakes yet...  Think about that.  All in, I've spent about $4,000 in repairs on this car.  No one should go through this many repairs for a car that has less than 55K miles.  In the last 9 months I've spent half of those dollars on repairs for parts that just brake.  I love this car, but if/when I get another, I'm leasing it.  I'll never buy a Volkswagen again.  A real shame too, because the fun factor is a 10.  Reliability factor is a 3.",,

5,The King of the 'hot hatches',ted gathe ,01/08/2016,5,1,5,,,,4,5,4,,,"I don't know who wrote the Edmunds review of the 2008 GTI but they are badly mistaken in describing the Honda Civic Si and- good gracious-  the Mini Cooper S as better driving cars than the GTI.  I test drove both those cars on multiple occasions along with a number of others and the GTI was by far the best vehicle in every category.  The Mini Cooper in particular was disappointing- noisy, tinny sounding and rough riding.  The Si has nowhere near the smooth acceleration and shifting of the GTI.   It's by far the 'King of the hot hatches.'",,
4,VW GTI Review,alekmed ,04/09/2013,,,4,3,3,4,,5,4,4,5,"Review EssayThe Volkswagen Golf GTI has always been the go-to hot hatchback to buy ever since the first version came out in 1976.It has had numerous competitors but few have been able to match the GTIÂs balance between power and handling.The GTI I am reviewing is of the Mk5 generation, with it being a 3 door 2008 model with a DSG transmission, or Âpaddle shifters.ÂOverall, this is a good car because it does what it is intended to be in a high manner, which is being the best sports hatchback money can buy.This isnÂt a base Toyota Yaris econo box; this car has been given tweaks over the base Golf to make it one of the best sport hatchbacks on the market. First off, the aesthetics ","With itÂs small size and excellent handling, this car feels like a go-kart, which is a good thing.
As for the ride, this car strikes a balance between enthusiast and daily commuter.
ItÂs definitely more harsh than youÂre average sedan, but itÂs far from being a headache as you go over bumps in the road.
The thin tires on the GTI do did a remarkable job of absorbing major bumps and holes in the road, and overall the car is very quiet, with the only major sound coming from the engine and exhaust when you floor the car.
The interior is also above average, with very supportive seats and nice fit and finish along the dashboard.
ItÂs all very well put together, unlike VWÂs of the past.

The power delivery is smooth and effortless and the engine makes a satisfying growl. The DSG is fantastic. The ride strikes a great compromise between sportiness and comfort. This car does everything. I can drive aggressively and have a fantastic time. I can haul 5 people, or 4 comfortably. I can haul a ton of stuff. I get great gas mileage. The interior of this car is far more refined than any of its competitors. The materials look and feel upscale. It's just a nice place to be.For the money, this car is darn near unbeatable. It is equally good as a daily driver and a weekend toy. ","DSG- smooth automatic when you're stuck in traffic, or pretend to be a race car driver on a good road

Engine- great noise, wide powerband, instant results when you put your foot down

Plaid seats- they look awesome (the seats themselves are awesome to sit in as well)

the steering wheel is a gift from the gods

18"" Detroit alloys- they look great

Quiet, refined cabin

There are no compromises necessary with this car. You can haul people and stuff, safely and economically and comfortably, it's easy to park and reasonable to insure, and it is legitimately fun to drive. I can't think of any other car (certainly not one in the same price range) that does all these things so well. ","The GTI needs at least 40 more HP to stay competitive against cars like the Focus ST and Mazdaspeed 3, both of which offer more power for less money. Since this can be accomplished with a simple ECU reflash, I don't see why it would be that hard. "

4.75,Expensive to own!,pbesong ,08/10/2010,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"Expensive to own and operate! It takes premium gas only, so while everyone else is paying $2.60 per gallon, you're paying $3.00 a gallon. It takes a special oil, too, which at Pep Boys costs $8.00 per bottle and you'll need 5 bottles. The oil filter from the dealer costs $28, but you can get it from NAPA for a mere $16 (still expensive if you ask me). And you need to change it every 5k miles. It's not a straight-forward oil change either. A bit more complicated. Xenon headlights cost $150 to replace and since the daytime running lights are on all the time, you're sure to burn through quite a few. I'm not keeping mine long enough to find out how many. transmission can have mechatronic unit problem.",Interior and exterior styling is great. The leather seats are wonderful. I like that the back seats fold down 60/40 with a pass-through in the center. Kicking in the turbo is great for accelerating onto the highway.,"Stock tires pretty poor in snow.

Car drives great, I average 27-28 MPG in a commute that is equal parts highway and city driving. I have owned MANY MANY VWs over the years, and some have been very problematic.  Not this one.

4,08 GTI,Mark ,01/06/2010,,,5,5,2,2,,5,3,5,5,"I purchased my 2008 GTI rather than a Mustang. I wanted a sporty, fast car. My decision was made primarily due to increasing gas prices. This wasn't solved since the car runs best using premium fuel anyway. While the car was extremely fun to drive, the ride is stiff but should be expected. Maintenance costs are high as are costs for replacement items such as tires. At 10k miles it needed a 4 wheel alignment. I always drove the car easy, no curb hopping.

I average 24 mpg when I keep it in drive.  The sunglasses holder up near the sunroof controls kept popping open during the summer if I had glasses in it.

Oh, did I mention my non-manual transmission driving wife had to be able to drive it too?  Under these strict stipulations, the GTI is absolutely sublime.  I bought mine for $20.5K and spend $100 a month on full coverage insurance.  I regularly get over 30 mpg on the highway and 23 mpg in town.

I am very impressed with the engine and the turbo lag hasn't really annoyed as I thought it might. The only problem I've had, which worries me a bit, is the tranny.

I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and look forward to getting in the car every day.  The Passat was a nice car, but zero fun to drive.  The GTI is an absolute ball.  This car reacts to every thought like it's hardwired to your brain. The suspension is firm but supple, taking bumps better than the Passat did.  I'm averaging 23 MPG in stop and go driving vs. 15 MPG for my V6 Passat.  I had read all the hype in the car mags and I guess, well, it's all true!","Steering wheel. Plaid seats. Fit, finish, and build quality are first rate.  Everything just comes together in the car; it's greater than the sum of it's parts.  If this car doesn't make you smile, nothing will . . .

4.875,The right choice,Duffy ,07/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have owned 6 VWs and was sure that I wanted to get something different and wanted a Civic SI. I then drove the SI and the GTI back to back and had no doubt that I wanted the WV. The SI was nice but from the second I sat in the GTI I could see the materials were of higher quality and it has more features, all the switches light up for the windows etc. And when you step on the gas in the GTI you get a rush that the SI does not provide. This car is simply a blast to drive, on the highway it is great, but the twisties is where it excels it is sure- footed and stable even when pushed hard.   On the practical side the hatch will work better for me (2 kids,skis,snowboards etc). ",The stuff under the hood. The suspension.The autobahn pkg,Bluetooth

I needed something more practical, but also wanted to upgrade slightly in performance. However, I also wanted to stay below (well below) $30k while doing it. With the current crop of hot hatches proliferating like bunnies (no pun intended), the GTI seemed to have the best mix of everything, features, performance, space and a well-executed interior. The Mazda3 was the only real competitor that gave the GTI a run for its money - especially in the value aspect. However, in the end, the GTI was more unique and hit a lot more design details that I appreciate (illuminated vanity mirrors for one).",In no particular order: -DSG -2.0 L FSI -Driving Position -Steering Wheel -Interior execution,"I would have really liked to have the previously available dual-zone climate control in this car.

Minus the FJ, I have always been around fast cars and wanted something FUN. I read a review saying that the GTI was the ""right car at the right time"" and can't help but agree. It's super fast, powerful, and all in all the most fun car I've ever driven. It's also safe and good in the rain!  Was concerned about the car not attracting much attention, fearing it looked too bland. I get so many compliments, however, on how sharp and ""sexy"" it looks.

Having said that, if it was too much of a gap I wouldn't have gotten the GTI.   The GTI is nothing short of incredible.  I had a GTI in 1995, when it was equipped with the VR6.  I missed that car when I traded it in & am glad to be back in the GTI fold.  I have owned other VWs and have always liked them.  This GTI is a cut above the rest, what a great car.  Not only is it quick and fun to drive, but it's well behaved too.  You can cruise, you can relax, and then simply by pressing down the accelerator - the attitude changes to evil.  ","The ""flat"" bottom steering wheel!  How cool is that?!  Now that's a feature that every sports car should have.  The DSG is so versatile, I love it.

I have owned twelve other cars in my lifetime and this one tops them all by far.  I traded in my Passat TDI for the GTI because diesel prices were out of control and I don't regret it a bit.  This car is faster and handles better than my wife's Audi TT.  I challenge anyone to find a car that handles better in the curves and can function as a daily driver as well.  This may be the car or at least the brand/style of car that I finally stick with.  I finally know what fast looks and feels like and this is it.  There's only one word to describe this vehicle: Fahrvergnügen.,"Form hugging seats. I am 6' 2"" and weigh 215 lbs.  The cabin is huge and the seat fits like a glove.  Cornering is like glue.  Style like no other.  DSG sounds and feels impressive. Just the right mix of power and grace.  LAUNCH CONTROL!!!","Homelink would be awesome.

After not being impressed with the frivolous gimmickry and weight of most Asian cars nor upscale pricing of the elite Europeans, I found the GTI to offer the highest fun per dollar while being environmentally friendly (relative) and with no unnecessary accessories.  It is, I found, more than than it; is a fully serviceable quality machine, that makes you feel good to drive. Its build quality is on a par with the best, and I am well pleased with my decision.

The moment I drove off the dealer lot on the test drive I new the car was different. Different in a good way relative to Honda products in this general price zone. The car is quieter inside, it feels solid. I love the DSG and the fuel economy is very good for a turbo.

But then, I test drove the GTI with the direct shift gearbox and I fell in love with it.  The paddle shifters on the steering wheel give the same thrill as doing the clutch thing.  But there are times when you just want to let the car take over.  On the other hand, drop the shifter into sport mode, step on the pedal and hang on!  What a rush!  The fit and finish are superb, like all my VWs of the past.  I also love the exterior styling.  This car looks like it is always in motion.  I never would have considered the GTI an option until they came out with the 4-door version.",As mentioned the DSG.  I also opted for the navigation system.  This is my first time purchasing this option.  I really like it.  I think the Nav system will become one of those things you can't do without once you have one.  Sirius Satellite radio is also very cool.  I opted for 2 more years.,"I'm a somewhat bigger person and I would really appreciate a non-sport seat option.  I just don't fit in them properly.

In fact, everything I've owned previously has been Japanese.  When I test drove this car, the drive won me over.  It is not the fastest or best handling car I considered, but it is the only one that made me grin uncontrollably every time I test drove it.  I love the way the car looks inside and out.  I love the way the controls feel at hand/feet.  It sounds good.  It gets good gas mileage (averaged nearly 32 on a 3 hr interstate trip with less than 1k miles on the odo).

I was shocked how quick it is and the 6 speed manual makes it that that much more fun to drive. ","It's just a cool car, too many great attributes to list. There are tons of safety features and this car has a solid feel (when doors close, etc). It's a great ride for under 30k.  ","Not available in VW's great 4-Motion. Also, I'm not sure why it has a trunk release button on the driver's door/keyfob as it does not open or ""pop"" the hatch. I got black, which is tough to keep clean - trouble is the rims have gotten a little nicked up in car washes, looks like I need to hand wash."
5,My first VW ,Sam ,11/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Test-drove a friend's GTI; I was so impressed I traded in a 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 GT.  As expected, I took a pretty good beating on the trade in. But it has been worth it, the GTI is a much more refined driving experience than the Speed 3, the suspension is more compliant to road irregularities and the turbo power plant provides power with virtually no wait time for the turbo to spool up to boost. On paper it is not as fast as the Mazdaspeed 3 but you would swear that is. Quality materials and workmanship throughout, engine and DSG are matched prefectly and is a really wonderful piece of engineering.  ","DSG, seamless acceleration, excellent seats, 10,000 mile extended oil changes, refined handling.      ","Offer rain sensing wipers, automatic on/off headlights, automatic climate control (dropped in 2008) and auto dim rear view mirror. "

Then one day my husband said go drive the VW GTI, well it was love at first test drive, I was hooked, the speed, the handling, the torque and it is a hatchback. They had to pull me out of the car. Have it about a month now and it is the most fun car I have ever driven. I helped move someone the other day and we couldn't believe how much we could fit in the car, it was amazing. This car is a blast, the gas mileage is very good, getting about 26,27 highway right now and that is with getting on it now and then. I use to hate my long commute everyday, but with this car I go to work smiling now. I am loving it.","The looks, the dash board display, the standard xenon lights, the safety features, the seats, the standard heated mirrors with blinkers, everything.",Can't think of any thing.
4.375,Great car,vitriol ,10/02/2007,,,5,5,4,3,,5,4,4,5,"Love it.  Test drove lots of others (Civic Si, Mazdaspeed3, 350z), and none come close to having this car's combo of speed, handling, practicality, fuel economy and build quality.  The interior is driver-focused and fit-and-finish is Audi-esque.  Handling is near perfect (although I budgeted for them, suspension upgrades may not be necessary at all).  Most importantly, it's the impression of speed that is so great in this car: it feels faster than other cars, even if it isn't actually.  For the performance, styling, fit-and-finish and the all- important fun-to-drive factor, this car is arguably perfect.  Great fuel econ and massive cargo space make it a great all-around value","Great 6-speed manual!  Low-end torque is plentiful and turbo pickup is smooth and predictable (little or no lag).  Love the HIDs, multifunction info display and the seats - amazing.  Standard stereo sounds great to me (I'm no audiophile, however).","Better iPod integration, wish auto climate control (Climatronic) was available (VW deleted it from GTIs in 2008).  "
5,"Not Bad, Not Bad at All",Katsai ,09/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car drives and performs well; the fuel economy is good and getting better. I previously owned a Nissan 350Z with a manual transmission and it was an outstanding performer. The GTI's performance is not as sharp and it does not have quite as much power as the Z, but is a better daily driver especially in the heavy traffic that I must deal with on a daily basis. The GTI is a very comfortable car, fun to drive, has plenty of power with very little turbo lag, exceptional build quality and easily accommodates my 6'1 250 pound frame. The 2 door has surprising room in the back for passengers, the stereo is surprisingly good, and I dont miss my Z.","2.0T engine and DSG are brilliant! Then there are the Xenon headlights, ergonomics and general styling (both interior and exterior). ",LSD (limited slip differential) and an auto-dimming rear view mirror.
