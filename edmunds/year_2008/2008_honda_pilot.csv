Car now has 150,000 miles on it and it has been maintained by Honda precisely as recommended.    Spent over $3000 for large maintenance items in 2014 and now looking at over $4000 in repairs including stuts, bushings, rear main seal, main bearings and engine fan motor.   Have had motor mounts repaired at least 3 times and have paid for several intermediate inspections (one in Dec 2015 & one in Jan 2016 because of excessive tire wear) that revealed nothing wrong with struts or bushing and now two months later they both need to be replaced and have ruined another set of tires.

I would have liked to have the option to get both the Navigation and rear entertainment systems together-something Honda really ought to consider. Additionally, the steering wheel controls are inadequate. Unlike my Civic, which you can go up or down on the radio stations, you have to cycle all the way through 6,1, 2,3,4 to get to preset 5.

The vehicle is perfect for a large family as it seats 8 comfortably (kids in th rear).  There is one flaw and it is identical to that in the 2005 model.  When driving at speeds greater than 40 miles per hour, try opening the rear passenger windows ONLY!  Start with the back right and you will notice a very loud hum or vibration.  It is NOT a minor noise as it is almost deafening and pounds on your ears.  I am not sure if Honda is aware of this problem.  I thought it was just my own '05 model that was doing this however it is identical in the '08.  The pilot otherwise is perfect! ","Seats are easy to fold down.  Plenty of leg room in the 2nd row and decent space in the third row for children.   It takes regular gas - big $ saver and gets decent mileage for a full size SUV.

I got a great deal because SUVs are no longer in high demand and the new body style was due out the following week.  I only use about 2-3 gallons more per week than I was using in the Accord, so a few extra bucks in gas is well worth the extra room for my kids (car seats, stroller, sports gear, etc).

It took 3 days to figure out what was wrong with the Pilot. Apparently some pin came out around the fuse box. Nothing major but what an aggravation! This is not my first new car purchase but my first Honda. I never expected the car to go down in 1 month. Never happened with any of my other cars.

The transmission and/or engine surges at cruising speed. Road noise is absolutely horrid at highway speeds. My eight-year-old F250 CC 4x4 is quieter. Ditto for handling. The body lean on curves and corners makes this vehicle feel like it is tipping. Even at low speeds. The aforementioned F250, with much greater height, weight, and ground clearance handles better. Suspension allows the front end to ""dive"" under just moderate braking.  Positives: Brakes are excellent. Interior fit and finish are above average.

Gas mileage could be better, although, considering it is a 4WD, 17-18 combined city/highway isn't bad.

Contacted both dealer and regional Honda office. They claimed that surface rusts are not covered by the warranty and declined to fix it.

4.5,Best Bang for Your Buck,T&T ,02/25/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,3,4,"The 2008 Honda Pilot is a great deal, pricewise (especially with big rebates now) and quality.  Honda has had over 5 yrs to work out any bugs from an already solid SUV, so I feel like I own one of the most reliable vehicles on the road.  In addition, it has enough pep, is versatile and roomy inside (we love the 60/40 split 3rd row seat for extra passengers when needed without shuffling around the car seats in the second row).  It rides like a heavy-feeling, rather sporty car instead of a ""floaty"" truck- like truck.  Its a Honda with great resale.","Price. Easy to use voice command controls for everything from climate control to Navigation. Ride. 3rd row seat. Fit and finish. Firm, heated seats with high-quality leather trim ","Cylinder management (shut-down) option for AWD to help with fuel economy. Eliminate lower metal-color painted surfaces near front seats, paint chips away too easily during normal use. Aux input should come with premium stereo option. Bluetooth today is a must."
4.875,Loving The Pilot,novol ,02/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,We recently traded in a Volvo XC90 for the Pilot and are loving it.  The interior is quite spacious and having a third row seat is a wonderful convenience.  The interior integrity compared to other makes we looked at does not compare.  I think we will keep this car for awhile.,"XM radio built in, 3rd row seat, front seat comfort.",None yet.
5,Great SUV,mike ,02/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Had a 2004 Pilot loved it and bought the 2wd 2008. Great car and love the Honda's reliability.Gas mileage on the 2wd seems much better than my 2004. Live in Ohio and 2wd doesn't seem much different than my 2004 awd. Love the XM feature on the radio, no more looking for stations on trips. ","Ride, gas mileage on a big safe SUV.",Shifter neeeds to be moved so wipers don't come on by accident. Radio cd needs to play mp3s and plug in for ipods.
4.875,On my second and would go for a third,Lovemy Pilot ,01/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just traded my 04 Pilot in for a new one.  They gave me 20k for my 04 with 52K on it. They are aggressively pricing these whick is why I bought a new one now. More importantly you cannot find a better built, more reliable, reasonably priced vehicle on the market today.  It is the best of all worlds.  Part mini-van, suv, 4 wheel drive vehicle with good gas mileage.  If you are looking for a family car, look no further.  This is one of the best cars on the market and their price hasn't changed much since I bought mine previous one on 04.","Comfort, roominess, smooth drivability","None, love it!"
4.875,Good all-around vehicle,Mac ,01/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We've had our Honda Pilot for one month and love it!  The stereo sounds great from the front seat, but needs the base turned up to sound as good in the back seat.  It's very comfortable during long rides, and fun to drive.    ","Nice smooth ride, and very quiet, except on noisy roads.  We love the storage spaces and cup holders, which are scattered throughout the car.  The second and third row seats fold down easily to provide additional space.  ","The front wheels spin out a bit when taking off from a stop, but perhaps that's due to the powerful engine?  With practice, however, we've learned how to accelerate without the spin.  "
4.5,Sweet vehicle,steve ,01/27/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"We searched for an suv that was large enough to be comfortable yet economical to operate and affordable. We found it in the Pilot. We test drove several before the Pilot and was not impressed enough to lay down the money. This impressed the both of us. It had what we needed and wanted with a couple of extra's that are nice. We like the room, the engine performance,third row seating for the grandkids,cargo area is great and the dependabilty factor played a large part of our decision. ","xm radio, dvd player, 6disc cd changer,wireless headsets for the dvd player",steering column needs more options for adjustment on this model
4.625,Quality over aesthetics,welshguy ,01/20/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"With 4 months and 3,000 miles now logged I feel I can offer some insight.  With the Honda nameplate you obviously are getting a quality vehicle.  I'm planning on getting 10 years/110,000 miles out of it and then handing down to my son in elementary school for college use.  I did lots of research beforehand and wanted the optional 3rd row w/out having a huge vehicle.  Bingo! My colleagues piled in for a trip with the 6' 1"" guy choosing to sit in the way back.  He said he was comfortable...but he didn't look it. They all commented on how much bigger it looked and felt inside than what they thought it would be.  I upgraded from a Jeep Gr. Cherokee, and this is hands-down far superior.  ","Firm ride and handling-much less truck- like than you'd expect. Some people complained about seat comfort, but I think it's great feeling of safety with keds in the car (loaded w/ airbags-and very solid) Entertainment system and conversation mirror are great for trips w/ the kids",Road noise esp. w/ sunroof open. Gas mileage. Gear shifter in awkward location. Radio max volume is lacking. Need more mix and match accessories instead of having to choose a model based on the few you want. Climate control makes noise behind the dash- it sounds like squirrels on a metal wheel
4.875,The most Practical car,Yahya ,12/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"i have owned this car for 2 years, i think this car is so nice, its comfortable, roomy, and has excellent performance. plus it is so practical for daily life. most people who own this car wont sell it easily, they just love it for all the perfect things in it like, the roomy interior, high performance, and excelllent handling. any one who has not tried this car, knows nothing about it, i really advise everyone to try it, and you'll certainly love it! ","Comfortable seats, so smooth on roads, high performance, excellent stability, perfect vtm4 system","i suggest that Honda improves the interior material a little bit, and increase luxury features."
5,Love This SUV and Fun to Drive,Great SUV ,12/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Just picked it up and it is the best SUV in its class. I drove many SUVs and nothing to compare to this little number.,"The pick up, comfort, room & the styling of it.",none
4.875,Four months of Pilot ownership,Fred Webb ,12/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought my 2008 Pilot EX-L with navigation after considering all other SUVs. The most important considerations in selecting it were safety, room for 8 if needed, comfort, and flexibility to go in snow and travel on moderately rough unpaved forest roads. I also wanted a vehicle with driver's compartment space for stowage of essential gear. The navigation system and XM radio have made driving more efficient and travel more enjoyable. Thus far, my Pilot has met all of my expectations. Fuel consumption has been quite reasonable considering vehicle weight. Ride has been very comfortable on 10+ hour trips. ","Favorite features are ease of driving, accessibility and readability of instruments, comfortable seats, sound system, navigation system, visibility of road, and plenty of room for luggage, etc.","Improve clock's visibility for driver, reduce road noise, and add display of fuel or miles remaining in tank before need to refuel. The most glaring need is for an iPod dock that plays through vehicle's built-in audio system."
5,Love This Vehicle,Rebecca ,11/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I love this vehicle. It is everything I could have asked for in a suv. I love the fact that it seats eight. I don't know how comfortable it would be for an adult to sit in the third row but kids would be just fine back there. My husband bought this vehicle for me for my 30th birthday and I am ecstatic!,,
4.625,"First Honda, so far so good",boro girl ,11/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,3,4,5,"After totalling my Chevy TrailBlazer, and then rushing to buy a GMC Yukon, I wanted a vehichle with a fold flat third row, 4wd, rear entertainment system, and lots of extras. I found it all with my Pilot Special Edition, with kids we knew we didn't want leather.  I haven't had to use the 4wd yet, but hope it's everything Honda promises.  It seems noiser than my Yukon, and not as comfortable, but I was willing to compromise given the rest of the goodies.  The gas mileage is reasonable.  In town, I get about 16-17 mpg, and 20-21 on the highway (at ~70mph).  So far, everything rings true to the Honda value.","4wd, RES, sunroof, interior style and colors, fold-flat third row, adjustable second row, xm radio, interior fabric, and storage spaces (everywhere).","Cushier seats, less road noise, better gas mileage, and cheaper accessories.

5,Awesome car. Best for the Buck.,eric b ,11/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I already own a 2004 Honda Pilot. I test drove comparable Toyota, Nissan, and Acura SUVs. Honda is the best car/value Bar none.  They've made so much enhancements to the Pilot since 2004 that I feel like I am driving a different car. Navigation is easy to use and I love the XM radio. I also like the fact that rear camera and fog light is now standard on Navigation model. I simply love it.",,Add audio in and play mp3. Be able to have both Navigation and DVD player.
4.375,Meaning of a family SUV,sasso1977 ,11/02/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,3,4,The Pilot is very stable if a little boaty at high speeds but it keeps good balance. Very roomy and the interior is well laid out. Went from an FX35 to a Pilot and I don't regret it one bit!,"Third row seat, lots of storage space, interior materials are of good grade and feel good to touch, nav system","Better mileage, auto windows for passenger side."
4,"Nice Truck,  Very Good Value",BrianG ,11/02/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Bought to replace an aging Isuzu Rodeo we're very happy with our Pilot. The Pilot is comfortable, a pleasure to drive, and of course Honda reliability. Acceleration is very good and noise levels are reasonable. The 2nd and 3rd row seats are easy to use and, folded down, they provide a large cargo area. Leather trim is nicely done and the two-tone effect of the Saddle color is attractive.",You can fold down the 2nd row seats with the headrests on. If you fold the seats often this is a big time saver. Climate control works well and is easy to use.,"Honda should be embarrassed by the EX-L radio. No RDS, no auxiliary jack (let alone iPod connector), no HD radio, and no playing MP3s on a CD. It is big, however. When was this thing designed, 1990? It may be adequate for a base trim level but not at the deluxe trim."
4.5,Solid Vehicle,T-Man ,10/28/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"This is my fourth Honda, and they have been great. Nice powerful engine, smooth ride, easy ergonomics, good feel to the vehicle.  Lots of room for my kids and Labrador (who can watch movies in the back). Nice ride.","DVD, XM satellite radio, 3rd row seats for carpooling","The Pilot is being redesigned for 2009, so I am sure they will move the shifter to a better location to not interfere with the wipers. 3rd row seats are a bit flimsy, but are fine for small kids."
4.625,Great Value. Legendary Honda Reliability,RiskPro ,09/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,This is a fantastic SUV for the average middle class family that wants virtually no service issues or maintenance requirements. Not to mention the 4wd which is good for those times us citi-dwellers need some help in the mud or snow and the 2nd and 3rd row seats fold away.  ,"Strong engine, great suspension / handling, 4x4, good looking and it is a Honda!",2nd and 3rd row seats appear thin and somewhat cheap looking but they are likely thin because they fold down and hideaway
4.125,First midsize SUV,Linda ,09/23/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,4,4,I bought a new '07 CRV 11 days ago but took it back and got an '08 Pilot. I have never had a SUV before but it rides nice and is very comfortable.
