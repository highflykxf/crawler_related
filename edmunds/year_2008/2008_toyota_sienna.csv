5,Sienna surprise,Christy Chase ,11/06/2016,5,4,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I never thought I'd say I loved a minivan, but this beast has been very good to our family.  It's very comfortable to drive and to ride in. Repair issues were as expected with use or because of other lame drivers who hit us and caused cosmetic damage.  It can carry a ton of stuff - large teenage athletes, Ikea furniture, household contents when moving homes, bikes, etc. I actually don't want to sell it, but we are downsizing.",,
2,Hate this minivan.,Davis ,09/02/2015,2,3,3,,,4,1,2,4,,,"Bought this van new in 2008 and have treated it well. Initially liked it well enough, though lack of flat area on center console was very annoying.  However, even from the beginning, poor craftsmanship/materials were evident.  Things started breaking within a year.  Pieces of trim coming unglued and hanging off, buttons breaking, etc. - those little things that drive you nuts.  I had to replace the factory standard tires and battery far sooner than I should have. Cabin noise has also increased significantly since purchase.  For the past 5 years I have had a gurgling behind the steering column that no mechanic has ever been able to identify, including Toyota dealership.  Van has begun to shimmy and vibrate over 50 mph, which no mechanic has been able to fix.But more concerning is the handling in all weather that is the least bit damp.  Despite trying various types of tires, and driving well within the speed dictated by road conditions, the van has significant issues with lack of traction and hydroplaning.  Even pulling out at a light on  slightly damp roads can cause the wheels to slip.  If wet weather is bad, snow is even worse.  I have gotten to the point that I just don't drive the vehicle in inclement weather.  The only reason I have kept the van is that I only see myself needing a van for another couple years.  Once the kids are out of college you no longer need that size vehicle.  So I park it on my driveway and use it only when my Honda CRV just isn't big enough.",,

Overall gas mileage is a tick under 20 mpg.

I'm a single guy with no kids and I drive a minivan, but I'm ok with that. This one is pretty nice and it holds a lot of stuff when I need it to. Superbly flexible and comfortable accommodations for any number of people.

It's an expensive car compared to the competition, but hopefully with the Toyota reputation, it'll last a long time.","The seating arrangement gives plenty of options, including moving the center console to the second row, moving or removing the second row seats, and of course the 60/40 third row folds down.

Lots of power options. Rear climate control. DVD player. Leather seats. 

Visibility is impressive for such a large vehicle.","I wish the A/C blower had a lower setting. At the lowest fan speed, it still blows pretty strong from the dash vents.

There's a lot of wind and road noise while driving. I didn't expect this. Perhaps quieter tires might help.

I don't like that there's no way to keep the radio information visible on the screen. When you change stations or volume, there's a little dropdown on the screen, but then it goes away to show the navigation. I want it to display the station info.

I have a Yakima roof rack and I added a 2"" trailer hitch to pull a small trailer.  Its perfect for me and my two kids.

",Holds everything.  Is super comfortable.,"Here are the things that kinda make me mad.
1.  Tire life sucks.  I got rid of the run flats and went to a used tire place to buy a spare that I carry on long trips.  If I get a flat in town I will have them tow me to Costco.  I bought some 90K mile Michelin Defenders at 69K.  I am having them replaced today, 40K short of their warranty.

2.  I have the NAV system.  Nothing pisses me off more than this.  I cannot enter an address manually when driving.  Neither can my passenger.  This was decided by their lawyers.

For one, this is a very comfortable and roomy car. The leather seats are pretty good and the ride is silky smooth.

Will Toyota run and hide again when major issues like engine failure -  or after class action lawsuit scares them will they ""Voluntarilly"" fix problems.  I have never heard a new engine sound so bad at start up.",Price - before GM and Chrysler rebates became available.,"More attention to details.  More interest in consumer complaints instead of  ""we are Toyota"" attitude.  Customer follow up for something besides profit makers like service.

It was priced cheaper than common competitors like the Honda Odyssey and Nissan Quest. The Sienna has outstanding power, it can get to 60 mph no problem (under 7 seconds to be exact!). Unfortunately, my family was involved in a severe accident in February 2009 with this minivan. We rolled over at 40 mph, thankfully nobody was injured. This car is incredibly safe. The stabilizer bars in the roof and doors kept the car very sturdy during the rollover. ","The Safety, Horsepower, and spacious cabin. If you are looking to buy a minivan, get this one, it is most worth the money. Do not purchase a Honda Odyssey, Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country or Nissan Quest.

However, at low speed, the transmission is very slow to shift with a rev that is unnerving.  The sliding doors just a few months after purchase have squeaked even though there have been several visits to the dealer.  I will be taking my van back to the shop again soon for this problem.

The vehicle tends to exhibit a delayed response from the trans at some points. Not sure what that is all about. Still not sure what mileage we got on the road but the city mileage is as advertised. Lots of room in the van and it is much quieter than our 2001 Grand Caravan. Acceleration is also excellent.

The Sienna rides way, way better than the Town and Country. Ours is silver shadow pearl. When we bought the Sienna home, our kids went crazy! They immediately fell in love with it. Even our dog fell in love with it. This will be our baby for a good long time. It is kid friendly, family friendly, and dog family. It's like a part of your family. No wonder why many people own these. A lot of our family members own these, and love them too! We absolutely love it. Simon is the minivan's name, and he is truly loved by his family.",Ride is super!

It handles well and acceleration is very good; overall, a reliable and comfortable vehicle.   But a vibration telegraphs into the engine compartment while gears shift and over the road making for a tiring drive;  transmission slips at low speeds.      Driveability is on the low end for a new vehicle.  (Be careful when test driving and take nothing for granted.)   Vehicle is 1 year old with fifteen thousand miles;  14 to 17 mpg around town, broke 30 mpg over the road once, now barely breaks 20.  Test drive with care and get one of the good ones.

4,"Weak Shifting, Steering and Mileage",John ,10/09/2008,,,5,5,4,3,,3,5,3,4,Acceptable performance at best. Sadly disappointed in several key features. Shifting at low engine speeds frequently causes unacceptable shift quality from 1st to 2nd gear. Intermittent but you see it way too often. Very poor gas mileage. I assume many of those who post good mileage are relying upon their electronic readout in the van. My inaccurate readout tells me I get 26+ MPG highway while the gas pump says 21 MPG at best. Same or worse mileage in town than if I drive our 10 year old beater Plymouth van! The engine change Toyota made in their vans a few years back provides twice the noise of the previous engine. The steering is acceptable at best but the weakest of any brand we drove. ,"Overall comfort, and performance. I can only hope Toyota lives up to its reputation for dependability. That was the primary reason for our purchasing this brand. Still within 500 miles it's had two minor electronic issues already.",Transmission shift points at low speeds need drastic improvement. Often winds out in first gear. Steering is weak but acceptable. Engine noise too loud for today's technologies. Toyota still has one of the best products out there but they won't for long if they keep letting things slip this badly.
5,Great van for a growing family.,Robert Cartland ,10/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We are expecting our third child soon and needed a larger vehicle.  We chose the Sienna primarily because it is the only van to offer eight useful seats -- the 8th seat offered by the Odyssey is too small to be useful.  We also like how the center seat can be moved forward for easy access to our expected baby.  Add Toyota's powerful V6 (with a timing chain versus a belt) and better real life gas millage and the Sienna was for us.  We have been enjoying our van, including a trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.  It was great being able to bring along the kid's bikes by just putting them in the back of the van (no need for a bike rack).  The van was a gift for my wife and so far she loves it!","We love the front-and-center 8th seat; this is great for an infant car seat.  Also love the room, the ride quality and the STAR safety features.",Add a backup camera to all models - this should be required for all large vehicles.

4.5,Great Van light on features,Bob ,09/23/08 15:36 PM (PDT),5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5," I recently purchased the 2008 Sienna Limited. I traded in my 2001 Honda Odyssey after 2 transmissions! So I wanted to try Toyota and I love it. It is like riding in a luxury car, smooth ride, quiet engine, leather, wood trim, 360 watt stereo and plenty of room. It's new, but I'm only averaging 16 MPG on the highway, so hopefully it will break in and get better. One complaint that I have is when you pay over $33k for a limited you expect a DVD and navigation system, Honda gives you that for the same price as the Toyota! However I drove the new Honda and it was sluggish, and would never trust that brand again. I guess a good engine is better then a good DVD and navigation system!","Luxurious interior, smooth powerful engine, lots of cool gadgets, smooth ride, lots of space, great stereo.","Gas mileage is a problem, when you get the limited you should get the DVD and navigation system for free!"

Even the fuel consumption is better.  Rides like a high end large full size car. Handling is very much unlike a mini van.

I'm almost done with the first 1K mile break-in (currently ~ 900 miles) and so far the experience is great. The van drives like a luxurious car, so roomy and comfortable that my toddler keeps asking to get on the van. We got our LE with option 1. We have driven over the mountain (from SJ to Santa Cruz, CA) a few times and the van has enough power to climb up with ease. On the highway, we were surprised that it's so smooth and quiet. Combining hwy and city driving, we have averaged ~ 22 mpg over 900-mile.","Trip computer, power, value, luxurious ride",Refresh the exterior from year to year.

With 8 passenger is really worth and the same thing in odyssey even kids can't sit it that middle seat (that much small).  It's just a week I started driving this but still few negative points like you can't make the 2nd row as bench seat by removing the middle seat and no power option for opening trunk in LE models.  If Toyota comes up with more option for LEs then no other minivan can come closer to this including odyssey.","Smooth ride, lots of space (wide), power sliding doors, etc","Backup sensor with camera option for LEs, easily removable 2nd row seats."

5,The Best,Mona ,02/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We took a look at 3 minivans, the Chrysler Town & Country Touring, Honda Odyssey EX-L RES, and Toyota Sienna XLE with extra value package 4.  The Sienna has the best ride of all three and handles well. The engine just blows the others away. I wasn't looking for power to win stoplight races but I got it, but I wanted the power for passing or emergency maneuvers requiring power.  The quality of the Toyota was the best.  I average 21.3 mpg in my Sienna.  Toyota Sienna is the best van on the market. ","Ride, DVD player, JBL sound system, engine, build quality and gas mileage.","Make JBL standard again, and offer more colors."
4.875,Mom of 3 loves her new minivan,Mom of 3 ,02/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Sienna or Odyssey? It's like 6 of one, half a dozen of the other. The two are both excellent, safe minivans, and if you have to have a minivan, either one will serve you well. I traded in a 2002 Chrysler Town & Country for the '08 Sienna because it felt more refined, and was more attractive inside and out than the Odyssey. The Odyssey has a tighter wheel and firmer ride--some call it more sporty. The Sienna's steering is looser, so you may not feel as if you have as much control, but you do. The Sienna's ride is incredibly smooth, and the turning radius is tight (for a minivan). There is hardly any road noise, and in my Limited there are more features than I know what to do with.","Power rear liftgate, light-touch power sliding doors, DVD, in-dash 6-CD changer, dynamic laser cruise control, high-intensity discharge headlamps, power-folding 3rd row seats, daytime running lights, moonroof, Bluetooth, power folding side mirrors, auto on/off headlamps, front & rear parking assist","Make the Sienna a hybrid! Also, improve MPG, offer ""front-and-center"" second-row seat as option in Limited, make 2nd and 3rd row sunshades removable so little kids don't play with them and break them, redesign speedometer and tachometer so there are fewer tick marks -- dashboard is too cluttered."
4.375,Best Looking Minivan,8driver ,02/15/08 15:25 PM (PST),5,4,4,4,3,5,5,5," We chose the Sienna over the Honda on price. We could get most the options on the Sienna that we wanted. It seemed with the Honda that it was all or nothing and not too many options. We like the people/cargo volume you get for the price. The van has a surprisingly tight turning radius, good for parking. I wish the power tailgate was an optional item. I would rather have that powered than the 2 side doors. The interior is pretty cheap looking and basically not pretty inside. The ergonomics of the stereo stink!  The engine is kind of rough sounding at times if you listen for it and the transmission can be a little jerky in certain situations. The ride could better. Overall we're happy.",Power. Hwy mileage. Storage compartments. 3rd-row stowing seats. Turning radius.,Interior trim. City mileage (hybrid?). More options. Second row seats recline in a very uncomfortable way. Stereo ergonomics.

Ride is smooth, handles great. Middle seats are tough to get out and put back in. Lots of room.",The room and the smooth ride.,Middle seats.
4.75,Granny pleased,Judge ,01/28/08 09:48 AM (PST),5,4,5,4,5,5,5,5, The 8 Passenger sold my wife   It can haul all of our grand kids and the mid seat that positions foreward is great for the 14 mo old to be accessed while driving and hold car seat.  It has been getting over 24 mpg on the road.  Fits in the garage better also.  ,The little mid seat for Mallory.  Gas mileage is good for van.  The other four kids like the electric back doors.,I can't but wonder why a car today would not be built with out installing auto headlights or option offer. My GMC pick up has this.  I would like a hot plug when the van is turned off to charge my phone. It would be good to have a plug in the Mid seat area also. 
4.875,Great Van  - BAD NAVIGATION,Great van - Bad  Nav ,01/19/08 13:51 PM (PST),5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5," This is a great van!  The quality is great...Toyota.  The layout is comfortable.  The only negative about the van is the GPS navigation system.  Many secondary roads are not on the map.  You cannot use the controls while the vehicle is moving.  Toyota says it is because of safety, however if you have a passenger along, you can't find a hotel or a place to eat. A real pain.  Don't get the GPS, buy an after market model that works on the move. The Toyota GPS is not user friendly and has a poor map (that you pay a fee to update).  I have a hand held Garmin that is far superior. Again, great van that I really love just don't waste your money on the poor navigation system.",Quality and design.  We are a Town and Country convert.,Change the navigation system!!
4.625,1st Sienna - Previous T&C Owner,1stSienna ,12/14/07 11:03 AM (PST),5,5,3,4,5,5,5,5," Overall pretty satisfied. Plenty of power. Very tight turning radius makes it easy to park. JBL surround sound system works great with DVD player. Wireless head phones sound good and are comfortable. Mileage around town only 16-17 but engine not yet broken in. Hopefully will improve. Ride is comfortable and quite but a bit on the ""soft"" side, would prefer tighter more responsive suspension. Power sliding doors have to be turned either on or off, and if on, manual operation is not possible. ","Engine power, DVD Entertainment System, 17"" Alloy wheels, overall fit and finish, internal passenger and luggage room, AC outlets","Eliminate the requirement to go back to dealer to change the way certain features work - locking, power features, security, etc., why isn't there a description of how to change the oil in the user's manual? Too much emphasis on going back to the dealer for everything."
5,"Big, Comfortable Van, dont call it mini.",banerz ,12/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We purchased this VAN (its no mini) to upgrade from my '04 Corolla (loved it) as expecting family to grow soon. It is huge!! Very comfy for passengers, but very vague for the driver! Rolls during cornering with soft tuned suspension and soft brakes. Interior is very quiet. Great for cargo haul - has shopping hooks for grocery. Folding console in first row gives driver mobility inside the van.  Gas mileage is 20-22 in town; Toyota's great build quality, but wish was slightly smaller and more engaging. Need to adjust to its gas guzzling habit during pick up. Toyota give a Hybrid option to help its pickup without compromising mileage.","Low noise & build quality, fold 2/3 row seats, radio with 6 CD changer, mp3 aux plug, overhead display w/homelink & compass (many mileage related stats), in-wheel radio controls.","Tune it for more engaging, less-floaty feel. Right time for introducing mild hybrid option. More 'anchored' space inside so things don't move around during turns."
5,Great van,RR ,11/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great van with lots of power.  Other minivans that I've driven (Dodge, Kia) struggled going up hills or at high speeds.  The Sienna handles beautifully.  The power doors are a very inexpensive option on the LE and are great.  If you are looking for an 8 passenger minivan, Sienna is the best option. Most other minivans don't offer 8 seats.  The Honda Odyssey does, but it has a very weird half-size 8th seat.  ",All around solid design.,None.
4.875,My 2nd Sienna - Great but nav is awful,New England Family ,11/10/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my second Sienna (the first was a 2004 and was great).  We bought this with the package #4 (rear DVD, navigation, leather) and like the comfort a lot.  What is clear at this point though is that our $799 Garmin 760 add-on for our other car is MUCH better for navigation.  On a recent trip from between New England and DC, the Toyota system kept trying to take us off the obvious main interstates onto other interstates and side highways and some local roads - even with interstates allowed in the options - it did this again and again and has left us VERY disappointed in what is supposed to be a high end feature.  The van itself is wonderful - best for comfort / quiet / ride.","I love the design - I think it's the prettiest minivan going.  It's so quite (which is great with kids), handles well, very smooth - all good features for a van that's going to haul you and yours on family trips everywhere.","As noted, the navigation system is terrible.  Toyota should scrap whatever they're using and go with Navteq.  It's almost a crime that they're charging for this unit as an up-market option given that it performs so badly.  Individual air flow control on each rear vent would be nice."
4.875,"So Far, GREAT!",KYFamilyMan ,11/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"We purchased this to replace a 10 year old Windstar.  This was a HUGE improvement!  Standard things are upgrades for us.  The little things make this a special vehicle, like the grocery bag hooks, the fold away back seats, and the speed sensitive radio with 6 disc CD changer.  No major road trips, yet, but looking forward to one soon.  This van handles like a car, but has all the comforts of a van.  Cornering is unreal.  Gas mileage is in the 22 range around town.  An average adult is comfortable in any of the seats, too.  My only wish is for a DC outlet, or at least an AC outlet in the middle seat area, and the motor is a little noisy.","Fold flat rear seats, everything about the radio (CD changer, mp3/wma compatability, speed sensitive volume, aux input), dashboard display, fold down center console.","Quiet the motor, provide power outlet to middle seats, and fix flip up middle buckets so you don't smash your finger between them and the front seat.  OUCH!"
5,The Best,Susan ,11/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"It has all the features you could want. I love the power of this 3.5L V6, I catch myself speeding a lot, and racing people from stoplights and actually winning in the mommy mobile. It gets decent gas mileage about 21 mpg around town. The JBL sound system is very nice and so is the DVD system. The seats are very comfy and the ride is smooth and quiet. you cannot go wrong with this van.","Power, features, value, reliability, and comfort.",Drop the prices a little bit.
4.875,2008 Sienna XLE ,Joanne ,11/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love my Toyota Sienna XLE model. I am now on my 4th one. I just purchased the 2008 model with sonar, moonroof, heated seats, Bluetooth.  It is awesome. When I was ready to purchase a new car I drove several, determined that my next car would not be a mini-van. However, already being a Sienna owner ('04 model) nothing else I drove compared with the roomy interior, comfortable seats, high end dash and control panel, and options. I have plenty of room to carry kids as well as adults. The third row of seats can easily handle 3 adults.  Many of the crossovers have 3rd row seats that are too difficult to get into or not comfortable for adults. Also, I drove the buick enclave and loved it. ","Bluetooth, heated seats, moonroof.",None.
4.625,AWD?,KJS ,11/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Sienna, along with Odyssey, is the top pick in this segment.  As such, there is very little to complain about.  The only thing dislike is the run flats that are standard on AWD models.  The rigid side walls transmit every little bumps on the road.  If you want a cushy ride then do NOT get AWD models.   Every things else is just great. Functionality is well thought out and suited for family life.  Many cup holders , bag hooks, and other minor details add up to a very usable car. ","Strong V6 engine (it's faster than my expectation of a minivan), roomy interior (I'm a big guy and I can lay down comfortably in the back, when I go camp), and build quality.",Plz use regular tires and figure out where to put a spare on AWD models!  Slightly better stereo would be nicer (base radio is just barely OK).  Automatic lights on LE models would be a good addition.

I average about 21 mpg around town and on the open road i have gotten up to 28 mpg cruising at 70 mph. The seats are very comfortable and the ride is smooth like a Lexus and quiet too. The JBL sound system is awesome and the navigation system is very easy to use and has bluetooth and satellite radio. The build quality is top notch and resale value is the best.","3.5L V6, gas mileage, comfort, DVD/navigation system, JBL sound system, and the quality of a Toyota.","The only complaint is make it to wear the navigation system is operable while moving, but it's a small issue."
