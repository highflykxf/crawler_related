3.75,Nice features but awkward interior,djfunkywill ,03/13/2015,,,3,5,5,5,,3,3,3,3,"I replaced my Toyota Solara convertible with this Volvo C70.  Despite similar horsepower, the Volvo seems to have quite a bit less pep.  I bought this car because it is nice looking and Volvo's reputation for safety and longevity.  Now that I've settled into the car, I've noticed that the interior is much smaller than my previous car.  I'm an average size male and I've got my seat quite far back.  Even this seat setting, I notice that my knuckles bump my leg when I make a turn.  I couldn't imagine transporting anyone other than a child in the rear.  It seems cramped on the inside but I hope to get used to it.","This car has the Dynaudio upgrade and it is nice.  If you enjoy your music with volume and bass, this system does well.  The HID headlamps make the night time seem like day although the bulb is about $100 to replace.  Even though it is turbo, regular unleaded gas can be safely used.","Interior is not only cramped, but awkward.  Although there are two cup holders between the seats, there is nowhere to put change or set an electronic device except for a bizarre shelf that is actually below and behind the dash.  "
4.25,Fun Pleasureable and reliable,fordmustang_27 ,02/20/2012,,,4,4,5,4,,4,4,5,4,"I bought this car used in march 2011. It came with 19,000 miles that woman put on before me. She traded it in and bought a new one. I compared this to the camaro, bmw and infiniti convertibles. These cars could not compete with the value and the feel of this car. The hard top convertible is amazing to watch go up and down. It has surprisingly good power with its 230 hp with its 2.5 liter turbo 5 cylinder. Still gets good gas mileage. I average 22 city and 28 highway driving slow like i normaly do. But I want to pass someone its very easy. Im at 30k miles and had no problems. Very reliable. Only thing its expensive to maintain. Around 200-600 dollars every time i bring it in. ","Looks, Power, and amazing hard top design",Nothing
4.5,"Liked it so much, I bought another!",4mercoachrick ,10/10/2011,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"We enjoyed our '08 C70 so much, we just purchased the slightly updated 2011 model.We kept the '08 for 3 1/2 years and just under 30K miles.It was never in the shop for anything other than scheduled maintenance and one warped brake rotor.The key-fob seat memory was a little balky...more of a nuisance than anything.Our avg mpg was 23ish for the total period, highway mileage was closer to 30 when we were trying to 'watch' it.After owning the '04 ragtop version of the C70, the '08 was superior in almost every way.Very solid with the top up or down...no problems with the top or its operation.The FWD can get a little 'slippy' if the driver sends too much power on slick roads, FYI.","Great top, very solid when up...stows away beautifully for top-down fun.
The '04 ragtop was the best of the four convertibles owned to date...the '08 hard top is in another league!
Premium stereo is very nice, although I've never owned a Volvo with a 'bad' stereo system other than my '72 145.

Plenty of power for 'normal' driving...more than enough for spirited highway driving.

Window-down from the key fob is a nice touch on hot days.
Trunk space is decent, making the most of the space available when the top is down.","After driving our 281hp XC60, I wouldn't mind if the C70 had a touch more power.
Slightly stiffer and/or adjustable suspension would tighten things up when needed.
Auto window-up when dropping the top is not needed; BUT an auto top down button on the key fob would be interesting.


By the bye, the above menu wouldn't let me choose 'automatic 6 speed trans', which is indeed what we have(NOT the manual)."

Although the inside isn't much to write home about, the outside catches eyes.  That's about it. In 3 years, it's been in the shop countless times...broken AC, heat, another issue with the engine.  The top has malfunctioned 3 times in the last 2 months...twice in the last week alone. Not what I'd expect for the cost. Contacted corporate and they were nice to send out some rebate coupons if I wanted to buy more stuff from Volvo. yeah right.  It's looking the brakes need to be replaced too after only 28K miles.  I'd rather have a KIA",Hard top is nice when it works properly,Train volvo service members how to fix things the first time around.  Customer service is a real treat too.  I expected to be at the front of the line when i'm bringing the car in for the same issues over and over again.  5 mile shuttle radius doesn't cut it when courtesy vehicles aren't available.

Then speaker, trunk and suspension rattles which were not repaired first time and still have speaker noise. Now, problem with low beam lights so cannot drive at night. Feel like we got a lemon. At Volvo more than in home garage. Traded 1995 vehicle with no problems, for a Volvo with too many repairs needed, especially for the price paid. At this point I am afraid to travel to far from home in it. Have already started looking for another make to replace the c70 after this repair is completed. Sad thing is that I love the look and convertible, but, it's just not up to the ""old"" Volvo reputation.",Was drawn to the C70 Volvo by the looks and hard top.  Absolutely love a convertible.,Audio system.  Wind monitor does not work correctly. Closer inspection of vehicles before leaving factory. 
4.5,Loving The Sun,Willy ,10/02/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,4,5,4,5,"Overall, I love the car. Ride is smooth, power is more than adequate and handling is nimble.  The beefed up Dynaudio Sound System is expensive, but AWESOME! The design of the system lets you totally enjoy the stereo even with the top down. Just wish my model came with iPod Dock.  Interior is very comfortable and quiet, though not overly spacious. There's plenty to love here, with a few minor annoyances: no iDock, the trunk cowl (required to be snapped down before lowering the top) could seat more securely, some don't like the back massage given by the big subwoofers behind the back seats, BLIS trips out occasionally.  ",Sun tanning my head through my thinning hair. The awesome sound system. BLIS is bliss. The comfortable front seats.,Integrated iPod. Help with getting a set of clubs in the trunk with the top down.  JUST ONE SET and I'd be happy.
4.25,Fun but I wouldn't buy another one.,Sue ,07/09/2009,,,1,5,3,5,,5,5,5,5,I just discovered that this car has no spare tire. I was never informed it was an option. Who ever heard of such a thing?  And Volvo is supposed to be so safety conscious.  The interior storage space is terrible.  Not even a road map fits in any of the side pockets.  Is a cell phone supposed to fit in that little well on the seat divider?  Whose? ,,Spare tire should be standard like all other cars.  Take the covers and center dividers off the side pockets so they're usable.  
4.5,Love this Car,Gilberto Rivera ,07/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,4,4,"We've owned our Volvo C70 for 18 months and so far no problems.  Quality, build and fit is excellent.  Car rides a little harsh but that is due to the 18"" performance tires which wear out rather quickly ($300 a pop to replace).  We get a lot of positive comments on the sharp looks.  Have one major gripe.  That is, the navigation system is a real ""Dinosaur"" to operate.  The Japanese beat the Swedes in the electronic software department, again.  ",The DynAudio stereo is great!  Even with the top down you can hear and enjoy the music.  With the top up the car is very quiet and the stereo sounds even better.   ,Scrap the present Navigation system on next model upgrade.  It's a shame such an archaic Navigation is installed on a car in this price range.

Fortunately none of them have been major, but a major inconvenience on my time.  My biggest problem has been getting anyone from Volvo corporate to give me a call to discuss some kind of resolution.",,
4.875,VolvoC70,wendydan ,04/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My husband and I purchased the C70 after doing extensive research over the last year. We owned a soft top Sebring Convertible and loved it but were considering a retractable hard top. We bounced back and forth between the C70 and the S60 with a sunroof. We admired the Volvo C70 the first time we saw it while on vacation, but were not sure we wanted to pay the high dollar amount. The mechanics of the hard top were a concern and while it makes this car very heavy, the safety features are a huge plus. Although, after selling our Sebring and missing the convertible for a week, it was decided that the C70 would be the choice. This car is incredibly sleek, comfortable and tremendously fun.

The lines on the car are beautiful with the top up or down. The ride is good and its quiet inside. The interior is a little on the plain side when compared to other luxury brands. The front wheel drive is great in order to cope with New York winters. I would not even consider a rear wheel drive car.,Beautiful styling with the top up or down.,The memory seats don't always go to your position when you unlock the door with your key. My 10 year old Chrysler performed this function flawlessly but for some reason the Volvo cant seem to retain the memory. You can always use the memory buttons on the seat but they must be held down.
4.875,Volvo 4 Life in Atlanta,"Stephen, Atlanta ",01/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I always wanted a convertible but steered clear of soft tops - loved the old C70 but only would have purchased a hard top.  When I saw online Volvo building a new hardtop convertible I had to have it (though I also steer clear of new models their first year or two due to the manufacturer working out the bugs).  Having had two BMWs prior I struggled with not getting another one but am thrilled with my decision.  This car even got a round of applause at a local eatery when I put the top down for the drive home.  I also own an XC90 SUV - both cars are white so a neighbor asked me if I work for Volvo now.  I would highly recommend a Volvo!!,Every angle inside and out - one of the most beautiful cars on the road - understated elegance.

As an owner of a 2000 C70, bought new and driven over 100k miles, I initially though I would select something different. I shopped the competition for convertibles and test drove many below and above the C70's price point.  I concluded the C70 was clearly the best value for me based on quality, style, and fuel efficiency. The C70 is not inexpensive, but the more expensive 328i and CLK350 could not justify  their higher prices. I have now driven the car for two months.  All my expectations have been satisfied. Great qulaity and value.","Car has honestly delivered 21 MPG city; 32+ MPG highway at 55 - 60 MPH. Edgy body styling, ergonomic driver/passenger design elements, and premium sound system are great.

What an great experience to drive this car, AND it isn't bad to have so many people take an extra look as you drive by.  Everything is within very easy reach inside, even visibility is great. Although I prefer all wheel drive the C 70's front wheel drive works well. I have about 4,000 miles on it presently and I am getting an average of 20 mpg and I have a heavy foot.

After they tested my car, they agreed it did leak while in the car wash. There recommendation was that I can either hand wash my car or drive it to their dealership and take it through their light carwash. Would not mind if I didn't have to drive 25 minutes to get there and being that my car is leased, this would be extra miles which I prefer not to put on my car. Volvo does not stand by product.
