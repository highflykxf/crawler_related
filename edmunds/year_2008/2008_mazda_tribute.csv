My wife thought we had a new ride. Always rotate the tires (front/rear, no X pattern) at EACH OIL CHANGE. The Tribute (Escape) rear suspension is soft (to avoid the jerkiness in turns) so the tires tend to chip off on the edges. So, diligent rotation will save the day.

Had to bring it in to Mazda and they corrected the paint job. The seat belts went for no reason at all. Mazda ended up replacing the all four seat belts. The transmission went while I was on the highway going 60 mph and I only had 51,000 k on my tribute. Then my car wouldn't stop stalling and it was because my radiator was leaking coolant. That ended up having a recall and they replaced that TOO. This car is junk. Everything is wrong with it. As far as I'm concerned this car is unsafe. They should invest most care and money into this car instead of constantly fixing it's non stop problems. ","It's ok on gas. Although I've been noticing it's been getting worse and worse the more miles I put on it, but I only have about 52,500 k right now. I don't understand why. My car is very well maintained and up to speed with everything. I can not wait to pay off my loan for this hunk of junk. A toyota will be my next car. ","The seats in my car are white and black. You would think considering making white seats in a car they'd pick a fabric that was more a stain resistant or a better color that hid dirty better. The car does not corner very well at all. The car has no horse power. My car is very loud and I've brought it in twice to be looked at, and still they've found nothing........... My window is going on the drivers side. This car is just falling appart more and more everyday. I wish I didn't buy this car. It is by far the worst car I have ever owned.

It was a simple car without any fuss, and perfect for me!  The only bad thing about it is the rust.  I noticed a few other reviews mentioning this, and i found it a little too coincidental that we all have found the same rust problems.  Mazda must have gotten cheap on their materials, or they stared buying steel from China.  I bent down to check on my tires one day and I couldn't believe how badly rusted out the wheel well was.

Switched to Tribute after my car was totaled and have had very good experience with it. They could have used better quality material but I guess then it would have been more expensive. Overall I find it a great deal for the money. There is little noise in the cabin while driving. I get very good gas economy. My advise is to use the plus fuel (mid grade) it gives you far more mileage for the price. I avoid the premium fuel since the car is not designed for it and may damage the engine in the long run. ,"Stereo is great, AC is ice cold, Plays burned MP3 CDs!

The exterior face of the fender is peeling off and the inside is rusted. My vehicle has less than 60k miles. I usually wash my car during winter almost weekly to avoid this type of problems. The vehicle also has been in a garage all nights so I don't get why  only a 2.5 yrs old car is rusting. I talked to the dealer where I bough it and they told that has a rust 5 yr warranty but covers everything that can make or made a hole in the body. They need to take pics and send it over to the regional warranty guy for approval. I'm trading in for a real Japanese car.,Interior and cabin space,Body quality and reduce cabin noise.

The major thing that has disappointed me is the lack of power, but that is what you get with a 4 cyl.  It gets fairly good gas mileage.  We went on a trip a couple weeks back at it averaged 27 MPG.  Its roomy enough in the cabin and I'm 6'4"" and feel comfortable in it.  Do wish there was a little more backseat space.  A/C blows cold and the radio is easy to use and stylish.

4.625,Somewhat Disappointed,STX ,03/31/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,5,5,This is the first time I buy a Mazda Tribute. Was pretty impressed with the design and the interior.  Has plenty of room for driver and passengers.  Has some good features that are very accessible from the drivers seat.  Very good on mileage and economy.  ,"The interior design makes the vehicle look very classy.  Looking at the vehicle from the outside, it sits higher off the ground - nice.","I was surprised at some of the features it lacked.  Some improvements I would like to see are the body side molding to prevent other vehicles from scratching yours when they open doors.  Also, I would like to see an outside temperature and compass with the computer reading show fuel economy."
3.25,Redesign needed,Like it ,03/26/2008,,,2,2,3,3,,4,4,4,4,"I bought the GT Mazda Tribute because of the standard features/price.But for a ""grand"" version, it is lacking. No lighted vanity mirrors. One coat hook in the entire car.Body side molding would help protect doors from dings. Interior looks like it was put together with spare parts, all different colors. Glare on driver side mirror reflecting AC vent inside car. Several mirror adjustments can't get rid of it. Would help if side mirror unit could be moved outward like on Chevy Blazers. To keep the cost of the vehicle down, I guess some features were not cost effective. ","Regular gas, 6 CD changer, console, heated seats, sunroof. Nice ride. Like that all the doors do not unlock when the car is turned off. ","Lighted vanity mirrors. One more ""coat hook"" in the back so you can at least use a travel clothes rod.Use one color in the interior. Redesign rear seats so you don't have to take them apart to fold them down."
5,I'm enjoying my SUV,I'm enjoying it! ,03/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have gone from $70 plus for a fill up to $40.00, from 12 mpg to 24. In the three weeks I have had it, we have been thru 4 inches of snow and two days of near 80 degree weather and it has kept me warm, cool and got me from point A to point B even while driving 15 miles per hour on the freeway.  Whats not to like.  ","I love the way it looks from the front and the way it feels inside. Black with Charcoal interior. I may die this summer but it looks classy! The stereo just plain looks impressive but is actually easy to use. A touch of the button and the rear window pops up, nice.","If I just had to pick some things they would be: the lumbar support is impossible to adjust while you are in the seat. Please bring the grab handles back. The overhead lights are too far back, perhaps map light. I will not do this more than 3 to 4 time in a year folding the rear seats down, ouch."

In addition, I don't understand why Mazda does not provide manual for audio system. It is not easy to grasp gear handle as console box obstructs my right elbow.

3.875,Wish I got the V6,Qmiller ,03/15/2008,,,4,4,5,4,,3,4,3,4,I have my 08 tribute for a month now and I wish I would have gotten the V6. I had a V6 escape that I should have kept. So far the 4 has been ok. Some days it feels fast and other kinda slow. I was trying to save gas but for now there's not much difference.,The safety features.,"What happened to the side markers that was on the older models? Soul of a sports car? I don't see it, I definitely don't feel it. Needs sporty looking rims like on the older tribute? All discs brakes would be nice and what happened to the standard privacy glass on the older models? More power."
5,Very Pleased with Quality,Al ,02/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Waited for this much improved model to be available; we are not disappointed.  Quality of workmanship is superb.  Body is solid as is performace; interior design very user friendly.  For the price this vehicle is worth every dollar.,"New design; exterior visibility; very responsive at highway speeds; very comfortablle ride; ok on miles/gallon, about 22 hwy; regular gas.",None.
5,LOVE IT!!!!,zoom zoom! ,01/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I just got this SUV a few days ago. What I can tell you is that I absolutely love it. I had a Honda Element and the Tribute blows it away. The Honda 4 cyl. isn't enough for the weight of the Element. I also had a CRV and the Tribute blows the doors off it. It has exceptional power to it without hesitation. No problem getting on the highways or passing. I have no intention of towing with it. The inside is way above the inside of the Honda's. The Tribute has a more elegant look to it and tons of leg room and cargo space. The long list of standard equipment provided is what also makes the Tribute and excellent choice for the money! ZOOM ZOOM!,"6 cylinder engine, 4 wheel drive with traction control, interior space.",In order to get Sirius Satellite service you must purchase an accessory that costs $500.00. That is excessive. Most cars are being made with that item standard.
4.125,So far so good...,Pat1usmc ,12/17/2007,,,5,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"So far I am very happy with my purchase and enjoy driving my Tribute very much. A lot of expert reviews complain about the engine and handling but I find the 6 cylinder to be very peppy when you step on the gas. Its no musclecar, but its more than satisfactory. Handling seems very solid, as it stays very flat through turns. Steering feel is also excellent. I bought it for the space, comfort and ability to handle offroad situations once in a while. Most SUVs that reviewers say are better than the Tribute can not go offroad. The price can definitely not be beat either. AWD Grand Touring edition at more than $2700 off MSRP! I feel like I got a lot of car for the money.","Offroad ability, confident handling, unique interior, heated seats, aux input for the stereo, comfortable leather seats, exterior design still looks masculine (not all curvy like many SUVs nowadays), and the PRICE! I can easily overlook the improvements section because of the amazing price.","Satellite radio w/o going back to the dealer for a $500 upgrade, interior handles above the doors, stereo controls on the steering wheel, full power driver's seat, better brakes, outside temperature readout, ability for the 2nd row to fold w/o taking out the headrests."
5,Great Compact SUV,Shad5000 ,11/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The AWD V-6 Grand s touring model is top notch in its class.  I upgraded from the 2003 Tribute this year and I am very pleased.  The car/truck gets lots of compliments and its new styling is a hit.  The drive is smooth and the cockpit is sporty and overall is a great drive.  Small glare during the day from the dash color on the glass but I'm sure I will get used to it.    ,Look of vehicle is appealing. V-6 power on a smaller frame has plenty of pick up.  AWD is now automatic as opposed to the older push button 4WD Tribute I had which is improved technology.,"Glare on windshield during the day, i.e. reflection of dash is slightly distracting."
4,My 2008 Tribute Mazda,Hosam Dajani ,11/07/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,4,3,3,4,All options were basic and standard. I am missing many nice features when I compared my Mazda to the Ford Escape. The car can out perform a Honda on the highway. The car felt solid on the ground when making sharp turns. The engine felt smoother with synthetic Mobile One 0W-20. The transmission is slow and heavy. The power of the engine is felt best on the highway. Solid when driven on sand or rocks. It needs many changes in my opinion.  ,The option of heating the seat on a cold day/nice. The option of the moon roof that opens automatically/nice. Loud music system/nice.,"Add a carputer built inside as a feature. Add a digital satellite receiver. Add solar panels on the top to recharge battery often. Add a hook up to place spare tires on the top, or the rear of the vehicle. Add more digital features like digital read out instrumentation with colored LCD screen."
5,I Love My 2008 Tribute!,j garvey ,11/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is a wonderful SUV. The first road trip I got 25 mpg with not even 1000 miles on the vehicle! Handles very easily on the road and while driving in town. Very smooth ride. Comfortable seats. Love the heated front seats on cold mornings. Great acceleration. Love the interior. The lighted instrument panel is nice at night. Heater really heats up fast on cold mornings. This is really a great SUV for in town driving or out on the road. ,"Love the interior design and leather seats. Also this SUV really is roomy, lots of cargo space and plenty of leg room for backseat passengers. ",Lighted mirrors on the visors. Also for the doors to lock automatically would be nice when you put it in drive. 
5,Wow II,Trebor II ,10/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I evaluated the Tribute after 400 miles earlier here. I have dutifully, every fill up, recorded fuel consumption for over 5000 miles now. The mileage is incredible and I have only done a few minor things to it --put in a K&N filter (at 4000 mi) and Mobil 1 at 3000 mi. Here are the stats: overall avg. mpg 28.5. High: 33.11 mpg, low 25.5 mpg. On last tank full, averaged 32.6 (90% highway). If I drive between 60 & 65 and get it into 5th at 30 mph, I can get 32+. Between 65 & 70, I can get 30-32 mpg. Driven between 70 & 75, 28-30 mpg is possible. Above 75, it tails off as you would expect.  This has got to be the most economical small SUV with a stick shift. Very pleased with it. ","MPG, handling, comfort, looks, interior.","Hand brake, on-board mpg computer, grab handles."
5,Great 2nd Car,Leon DeHart ,10/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was coming from a long period of driving full-size pick-ups and looking to downsize! This was a good choice to go smaller with good fuel results, and yet not feel much had changed in the process. I still sit up higher. Interior can carry cargo too.",Interior room and quality.,"Needs side door guards, that also add to appearance."
3.875,Mazda Tribute 2008 Grand Touring,Joy ,09/26/2007,,,3,4,4,5,,3,4,4,4,"I always wanted a Tribute but I like the 2006 exterior better than the 2008.  The 2008 looks too much like a box.  I really like the exterior look of the 2007 Honda CRV, but I like the interior of the Tribute.  I made the purchase because it was the best deal for the money.  I like the feel of sitting high and seeing far in front me.  I don't have 4WD and sometimes it feels like the car skids or sways if I'm traveling at a high speed and need to come to a sudden stop.  This makes me a little nervous.  It's not too bad on gas either. It's really growing on me.","I love the 6 CD changer, 10+ radio station settings, tire level alert, leather interior, blue/red lights inside, large console storage including CD holder, AC outlet in back, seat warmers, handles on hatchback.",Radio buttons on the steering wheel.  Interior handles to assist in getting in and out of the vehicle.  You'd think this would be mandatory?!  Did they forget and decide it was too late to add?  Even small compact cars have these!  Makes me scratch my head.  Bigger glove compartment. Quality interior.
5,Love This SUV!!,c.sims ,09/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just purchased this SUV after looking at, reading about and test driving almost every small SUV out here.This is one of the sharpest ones, inside and out, on the market. It has every standard feature you would need and the dash is black and shiny and looks really expensive. The interior design altogether is just beautiful. Great job Mazda!!","The dash, the exterior, the interior, the 6 cd player, the fact that it draws attention, the color - black of course - all of the standard features and so on.",A little more engine power and that's it. I love it!!
5,Wow!,Trebor ,09/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've only driven this 2.3 L Sport 5 spd 400 miles or so. Traded a Mazda3 hatchback 5 speed with a variation on the 2.3 less torque and more hp. That engine is very sweet in the tribute and the shift linkage is nice. It's quiet at speed with a nice ride and quick good steering feel. And the epa nos. (22, 28) lead me to believe that 30 mpg on the highway will be possible.  The interior is nicely designed and colorful (yellow/black upholstery/dash).  If the fuel efficiency is similar to 3s, then Mazda/Ford  have hit a home run by adding the 2.3L engine and stunning body upgrade. Great value!","Engine, ride, design (exterior and interior/dash), upholstery, flat with seats forward.","Seat height adjustment, hand brake, disc brakes all around."
4.875,Small SUV Zoom Zoom,Native Austinite ,08/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Research led me to the CX-7, but turned away from the premium gas requirement. Looked at/drove the Tribute and although ""boxey,"" unlike the sleek CX-7, I insisted on a vehicle that operated on regular gas. I've had mine since the end of April and have had a couple of road trips. The ride is smooth and quiet, it's roomy, handles well, seats 5. V6 has the power to get you through traffic, not real impressed with the brakes, a bit mushy. The leather interior really dresses it out. A very good value in comparison to other small Japanese SUVs. Fun to drive.","Great standard features including side air bags, tire pressure monitor, fog lamps, 6-CD changer and MP3 plugin, heated front seats and side mirrors, sunroof, and intelligent key.","Gas mileage could be better, would be interested in a hybrid version. A little more leg room in back seat would be a plus. Not crazy about the white dash panels in otherwise charcoal interior.  Mazda, please put in lighted vanity mirrors."
4.75,Great vehicle for the price!,ChuckFuller ,08/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Over the years, we have owned 3 Mazda Proteges and 2 MPV vans. Mazda has always delivered the highest quality vehicles we have owned and we expect no less of our new 2008 Tribute. We decided on a fully optioned Grand touring model in the the i series with the 2.3 liter 4 cylinder. I find acceleration to be quite responsive and I'm sure to appreciate the better economy. Unless you need a tow vehicle, I highly recommend this combination. I'm surprised by some of the less than complimentary professional reviews regarding styling cues as I find the vehicle to be gorgeous (gloss black over ""stone"" leather). All in all, an A+ experience to date.","Best, mirror-finish black paint job I've owned. Really smooth.  Smaller exterior proportions for confident parking, yet interior room in the driver's compartment is outstanding. I'm 6'3"" and my large frame is very comfortable in the seat, and headroom is great, even with the sunroof on my model. ","As much as I love the slick lines and the black mirror-finish, I'm parking on the outer fringes because NO side molding of any kind. That first good door-ding is going to really hurt and could have been prevented with a little better design/engineering. Ride could be a bit smoother as well."

We where going to get the CX-7, I'm glad we got into this vehicle. It's roomy, the styling is great. The aux input jack comes in handy. It's even Satellite radio equipped. I put in a TomTom GPS navigation device, It's the vehicle we needed, great features. Side impact air bags for protection. All in all Mazda, went over our expectations. Definitely recommend this SUV.","MP3 CDplayer, aux jack, all around features, drive, gas mileage, acceleration, comfort, no wind noise, quiet ride, tire pressure sensor to let you know the tires need air, safety, I love this SUV!",One improvement that could be made would be having a hybrid available as a model.

The Tribute has a ton of standard features and Mazda did a great job with instilling the ""sport"" into driving, even in this SUV.  We weren't expecting it to go fast since we opted for the 4 cyl but so far we are impressed.   It doesn't have a problem passing, merging, etc.  Also the interior quality is 10+.  It feels like the knobs to turn the vents are wrapped in leather.  And the glossy black dash isn't cheap, it's sturdy polished ABS. Love the car!  If you are comparing it to other manufacturers this one has a ton of standard features for less cost than the others.",The aux jack!  Use it daily.

4,Mazda Tribute 2008,Chicago ,05/16/2007,,,5,5,4,4,,4,3,3,4,I have had my new car for about 2 weeks now.  I bought the black on black but had the dealer cover the white seats and dash with black leather.  I love the drive and the comfort.  It is a great suv without having to pay big bucks.  A lot of room inside and very sharp dashboard design.  I have the 6 cyl.  There is a lot of pick up. Also very easy to handle on the road.  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this midsize suv. Not sure on the gas mileage yet although we are taking a road trip in a couple of weeks.,,Who the heck approved the white dash and the white seats?  Big mistake!

As expected pick-up is slow.  Even thought it's Japanese, it reminded me of my 1995 Ford Taurus, design seemed very similar to Ford.  And as expected instruments in the car are not as sturdy and are more of Ford quality.  But it's too soon to say anything, it's only been driven 350 kms!","Amazing design, both inside and out, appearance of the car is absolutely great!  Colors are also great especially the two toned interiors.  Reading lights are also great.",The back part of the front seats should have a plastic border on it as the leg space is to small and kids kicking their shoes will create a mark on the fabric.  Leather and 6 CD should be offered on GT models.  Not enough storage spaces and no coin box.  No storage space for sunglasses.
