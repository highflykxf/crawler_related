Very good seats, very adjustable, heated and cooled.
Fast.
Very comfortable for long distance driving.
Very very smooth ride.
Reliable except for high beams.
Excellent transmission.
Efficient power train.
Rear windows go all the way down.
Huge back seat.

Big trunk.
","The 2008 is a geazer-mobile.
Get the float out of this thing.
I know Toyota knows how to make good handling cars.
This thing is absolutely the least fun car to drive in the mountains I have ever been behind the wheel of.


Lots of power.
This thing needs all wheel drive or at least positraction on the front wheels.
You way overpower this thing if you stab the gas.


The ipod needs to be controlled.
I have given up on ipods and now playing my CDs again.
Too much trouble and distracting to use ipod.


Where is the sat radio???
Cheap cars get them and this one did not.


Overall a really great reliable good gas miles car.
Likely one of the best cars you can buy at any price.

4.75,Amazing Car to Drive!,kcoughlan ,11/12/2012,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Purchased this Avalon from family member, 79000 miles. Upon inspection my mechanic could not believe the condition of the vehicle for the amount of mileage. The quality and craftsmanship of this vehicle is the best that I have ever experienced. Whether around town (18 mpg) or on the highway (28 mpg), the performance of this car is outstanding. All the buttons and bells , except for on board navigation which I substitute with my own gps system. Incredible stereo system. Can not believe that this is a 2008. ","Acceleration and handling on the highway. Quiet level drive at 75mph (Maine). Rear seat is more than adequate for my 3 preteen children. Tons of leg room.

4.875,Love it! ,ksgirl1 ,10/31/2012,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"I bought this car used in 2/11. It now has 101,000mi on it. I have it serviced at Toyota and it always checks out fine. So far I have been nothing but pleased. I have put 22,000 miles on it and have taken it on several long 2 day road trips. It is very comfortable. I have two small children and the backseat has tons of space for both of them and all of their stuff. Love the reclining back seats and built in sunshade. Trunk is huge. I have all the bells and whistles and love the navigation, built in Bluetooth etc. We just recently replaced the battery, other than that no issues. Would highly recommend. ",,
4.5,It is what we thought it would be...,iknowhatikno ,10/18/2012,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,5,3,"If you are looking for a used Avalon, this is the year to start from. The revised 6 speed transmission is a marked improvement in smoothness, gas mileage, and reliability over the 5 speed autos from 2005-07. There are numerous websites and complaints about thse tranys). Also, the car was freshened on the exterior and has an Ipod plug. The one issue with the '08 model year is the headlamp assemblies, which are a well-documented problem. The good news is that Toyota extended the warranty for the headlamp assemblies for 5 years and 75000 miles from the original in service date. But you have to call Toyota because many dealers will rip off the unsaavy. The Avalon is otherwise a great car.","My consistent gas mileage is 33 mpg highway (usually cruising at 75 mph) and 26 around town, as long as you don't race from stop light to stop light. This is not a sports car by any means, and begs to be driven easily and serenely. Your rewards is a fantastic and comfortable ride, with a very potent engine and yet unbelievable gas mileage. How many 270 HP cars with plenty of room for 5 get 33 mpg highway? My Avalon actually gets slightly better gas mileage than my friend's 2011 Altima, although it has nearly 100 more horsepower! This car has no squeaks or rattles of any kind, and I have to trek up a long, steep, unpaved driveway every day. Also, the materials quality inside is excellent.","The trunk is relatively small for such a large car. The front console cupholder slants so that the drink actually is held at an angle, which is a strange engineering oversight. The long handled telescoping adjustment for the steering wheel feels flimsy and does not fit with the rest of the car's interior quality. It would be nice to have some control over the trip computer, although I like the fact that gas mileage resets every time you fill the tank so you get legitimate tracking various types of driving. If you do drive the Avalon hard, thinking of yourself as a NYC cab driver, your gas mileage drops precipitously. Otherwise, this is the best investments you can make for a family sedan!"

The ride is very comfortable even with the touring suspension, unlike my 2010 venza...There is still more body roll than I expected but I like its stability.

4.125,2008 Avalon Limited not perfect,patrick59 ,04/04/2011,,,4,5,3,4,,4,5,4,4,"I purchased an '08 Avalon Limited with 28,000 miles on it four months ago. So far, I'm only somewhat satisfied. Unfortunately, the dashboard rattled and squeaked as if it had 180,000 miles, although I didn't notice that when I test drove it. I had to jam coins down the sides of the dash where it meets the windshield columns in order to tighten it up. The workmanship of the assembly is poor. Also, the front seats would not heat or cool, but the dealer fixed that problem before I took posession. I like the bluetooth connectivity, but the sound of the phone only comes out of one speaker and it distorts pretty badly if you turn it up enough to hear the other person at highway speeds.","However, it does handle pretty well, has good acceleration, and is fairly quiet inside now that I've gotten some of the squeaks out of it. Wind and road noise are minimal. The seats are supportive and it's generally very comfortable on a long trips which I've now done many times. The audio system sounds very good and is easy to use, as are the other controls, which are arranged pretty thoughtfully. The gas mileage seems to be good, but I really don't know exactly because the trip computer is pretty useless due to the total lack of thought in the way it's designed.","The trip computer can't be reset at will by the driver. It resets itself whenever you put gas in the tank. So, you can't clock your average mileage for prolonged intervals. Also, you can't isolate highway mileage only. I get gas and then head to the turnpike. 25 miles down the road, the average is still slowly climbing because it's factoring in the idling and red lights getting to the highway. I've never had a car that doesn't let the driver reset the mpg. WHAT is Toyota thinking? Worse, the trip timer resets every time you turn off the engine. So much for clocking your driving time on a long trip. Don't make any pitstops unless you write down the elapsed times and add it all up. Useless."

This model the 08 was involved in the acceleration recall and computer adjustment.  But just this past week the light all of a sudden went totally out! Upon investigation it's the classic HID light problem that is so abundant on the Prius.  Apparently Toyota is well aware of the problem and the critical safety issues involved if you go to consumer reports, NHTSA, etc you may well be surprised of the cost involved with the HID light problems w/ avalons and most notably the Prius.

I don't need a lot of gadgets in the car to keep me happy so the Avalon has plenty to keep me occupied. I consider the styling simple, or classic, so it will look good 10 or 20 years from now.

4.875,Best Large Luxury Sedan Ever!,TSmith ,05/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've previously owned a Camry and recently traded my Solara for the 2008 Avalon. I have no complaints. I am a tall women and there's plenty of leg/head room, 3 avg sized adults fit comfortably in the back seat, tons of trunk space, and good price. Horsepower and handling are great. I can zoom uphill, through traffic and curves with ease. Avalon luxury is, at its best, highly comparable to Lexus without the price tag. It's a smooth, quiet, spacious ride - especially when you have a long commute to work everyday. Best car purchase I've made to date. The exterior design is beautiful. I am constantly being approached with compliments. I would recommend the Avalon to all.","Horsepower, high tech but user-friendly dashboard, spacious interior, exterior/interior stylish design, plush leather seats, smooth ride, puddle lights on doors, Smart Key capabilities.",Touch screen for navigation system. Otherwise the Avalon is perfect!

The Toyota Avalon is a true luxury roomy sedan with a reasonable price tag. Looked at Buick, Cadillac and Chrysler but found the Avalon to be superior quality, comfort and with great technology features. Got the fully loaded limited and it's a pleasure to drive with good mileage rating.","Smooth and powerful engine, navigation system, Leather, comfortable ride, roominess, interior and exterior finish and fit.",none

I use premium & Mobil-1 5W30.  The seats jiggle over bumps.  The back doors need to be rehung.  Accelerating and maneuvering make dangerous torque steer,  I like the 3/4 large size and big interior space, but seats not comfortable on a long drive, even for driver, in spite of adj lumbar.  I've had a lot of great cars recently, everything from an 06 Evo IX SE to a Camry Hybrid.  I like big cushy cars.  An old chassis and should be retired.  Paint scratches if you frown at it.  There are lots of goods cars out there, this is not one.  ","interior space, exterior size and proportions",Use previous Toyota Crown rear-drive chassis and new 2.7L four cylinder Hybrid system.

Since the 6speed replaced the 2007 5 speed I decided to go for it. So far the 2008 excels over the 2003 in almost every respect (trunk has slightly less usable space).","Engine power, rransmission, fuel economy(31 hwy, 20 local). Regular gas. Huge back seat (never use it).","More control for readouts (ability to reset avg mileage). Seats should be a little deeper, provide more thigh support. The VSC can hang you up in the snow, should be able to turn it off. 2003 had snow mode. Rear seat back should go down. How about a choice of darker interior."
5,A Luxury Car,Gil Seidman ,03/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is truly a luxurious car that makes driving an enjoyable experience. It is extremely quiet and smooth shifting with almost no wind noise. I use regular gas on the highway and can get almost 30 miles to the gallon. The seats are heated and very comfortable. It also has an excellent stereo radio and CD system that you can control on the steering wheel. There is no need to spend more, unless you are a status seeker.","Besides the ride, there is the keyless entry for doors and trunk, the finish and fit of the leather interior and the navigational screen that darkens at night. The look of the dashboard at night is also impressive.","A rear view camera when you back up, or a rear beeping radar sound to warn you of the proximity of the bumper of the car behind you would be a nice feature. A more user friendly navigational system would also be nice."
4.75,Not many cars offer the blend Avalon has,happyowner ,03/17/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"If you have a shopping requirement for lots of room, fuel efficiency, 5-star NHTSA ratings all around, Toyota-like reliability & resale value you may find the list is quite short as I did.   A 3600lb sedan with true seating for 5, 95mph 1/4 mile trap, and real world 32mpg regular in rural driving seems like a contradiction to me but this car is proof otherwise.  Comfort and performance are well documented and all of it is true.  Fun to drive of 8 because I find myself looking forward to driving it almost as much as old RX-8.  Only 2 things wrong with the car so far if picky: the rain sensing wipers don't activate in misty conditions and the wood panel on driver door is misaligned.","Keyless entry and start is great if you always find yourself carrying things and fumbling for the keys.  A rear sunshade should be standard on all cars. At first wary of the dynamic cruise control, but now I use it all the time in lighter traffic.  It works very well. Headlights work very well too.","Center console houses aux port and slides forward for nice armrest, but you must slide it back to to get to iPod. Side mirrors don't fold and the turn signal should be on the casing instead so it doesn't flash in my eyes when I am switching lanes."
4.25,Nice Ride,Cardriverdavid ,02/27/2008,,,3,5,4,5,,5,5,4,3,"The car has a nice ride, but in the 6 months of ownership, the dash has several rattles, and I have noticed several misaligned panels.  I wish the dash was not so far forward or large, the front seat area needs to be larger for longer trips.  I love the controls, but not the gray paint of the hidden radio panel. The ride is the best feature.  I drove a 2008 ford taurus recently, and the ride felt more solid and flat, like a german car, and was just as nice as the toyota.  Wish I knew about that car earlier.","The ride is the best feature. I like the gauges, and the technology offered in the car.  ","The dash is overdone and to large, the car does not feel as spacious as its dimensions, and visibility could be better for such a large car. Rear bumper sensors are needed as well as AWD availability. A few squeeks and rattles in the dash are annoying.  More pad in seats."
5,Wonderful vehicle to have.,QuasiTT ,02/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"For the short time I've driven this car, I've loved the comfort, feel and response. It drives like a car many more times expensive then it is and the fuel economy is surprisingly good. On a 300 mile trip, with the last 100 miles through the Tahoe Mountains, I still had 29.3mpg.  That's something to brag about in a car that will put you back in the seat when you need it most! Very well done!!","The seats are so comfortable that after 4 hour long, none stop trips, I didn't crawl out looking to streatch cramped muscles. I couldn't even tell it had been that long.","I love the 6 speed transmission, if anything adding a 7th may improve mileage as well.  And if you could change the tank to a 22gal possibly adding to extended driving experience for those of us that like to drive instead of fly. Other then that, you make a damn fine automobile."

Not another competitor can come close and you get it with Toyota reliability and quality. Styling could be improved but if Toyota did that then there truly is no reason to buy a Lexus LS. Seems same reasoning went into nav system. Portable GPS has touch screen for less than $200 now. This one doesn't. Lexus GPS does. If Toyota cleaned up a few very low cost details there would be no reason for the Lexus brand. Toyota's challenge is keeping the ""goodness"" of this product away from their prospective Lexus customers. ",Large backseat. Real people fit and fit comfortably.

The cushion you sit on is too short, they should have made the passenger seat like the driver seat, on a long trip it is irritating and uncomfortable. The seats could have used more padding. I like the way the car handles and the mileage is great. The exterior of the car could be sportier.",Car drives very good.  Good gas mileage and very responsive.  Back seats are roomy and very comfortable. Sunshade is nice.  Great visibility out of car.    ,"Passenger seat full size like driver side (not jump seat).  Side moldings should come with the car, not optional.  Side would get banged up very easy.  Make the Avalon sportier It looks like a old persons car."

Ride, handling, comfort, fuel economy and Toyota reliability are superb! We both have back problems and this is one of the few cars that we can sit and drive without pain and discomfort.  The 8 way power heated seats with power adjustable lumbar support on both sides are a big plus too. After owning a 2001 Avalon, we did not consider anything else.  Why drive a Lexus and pay 10-15,000 more just for the ""L"" on the exterior. Previous cars include BMW 525, Mercedes E300, Chrysler 300M and we would not go back to driving any of those again for a number of reasons.","Seats, 12 speaker JBL sound system, keyless entry and start.",Body side moldings should be standard.

I think this car is great. The mileage on regular gasoline is around 26 mpg (I drive mostly highway).  Before this car, I had a 2001 BMW 330i. So the avalon seems not very responsive to cornering and ""hugging"" the road. However, an avalon is more of a cruising car...and not a performance car. I would say the acceleration is more then enough (and actually comparable to my old BMW) however, take the turns slow as slow as the avalon will lean when taking a sharp turn.  ","Push Button Start/Stop, Mileage, Power w/6 speed Auto Trans, Roomy  If you can live without a luxury name (lexus, bmw, etc), this car is great choice. For the money, you will get the most options and feel as though you are driving a $45,000 car for only $35,000. ",The Avalon also seems to pull to the left when pushing the accelerator hard. I think this is a common problem for front wheel drive cars...so no points should be deducted  Worst features is the basic no frills exterior design and trunk access button  
4.875,Superior Automobile,gmb ,12/27/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We previously owned a '96 Avalon, and were very pleased with it.  This car, however, is superior in almost every way.  We tested against Lexus, Infiniti M, Acura: for features, performance, fuel economy, and price this was the correct decision.  This is an outstanding automobile.  The styling is a bit stodgy, and the navigation system a bit cumbersome, but these minor drawbacks are more than made up for with comfort, engine response, fuel economy for the HP, and overall integrity/fit and finish.  I spent ~3 years researching this choice, and we made the right one.

Of course outside looking at the car as well!","Keyless entry, turn on at distance, blue tooth, seats, wow. I love this car",The gas mileage. I had a Scion xA and the same was 38 mpg on highway.

5,As advertised,nmcintire ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I drove a 1996 Acura 3.2TL before buying the Avalon after comparing new Nissan Maxima, slightly used Acura RL 2006, slightly used Infiniti M35.  What sold me was the comfortable and quiet ride and the available feature set.  It didn't hurt that Toyota takes regular gas AND gets better mileage than other large cars.  I don't understand the other reviewer citing difficulty with entry/exit into the car; seems like that's something one would notice prior to purchase and, if it is that significant of a problem, look elsewhere.  The car rocks; great stereo, silky transmission, great power, bluetooth is easy to use, still learning navigation, but seems intuitive enough.  Overall, A+","Smooth, quiet ride, bluetooth connectivity, great stereo, comfortable seats.","Not as crazy about the silver-painted covers for interior controls (nav, radio) - would look better and wear longer in the wood finish used on steering wheel.

I am female-5'6"" (sr) and have to practically back in to enter and swing my legs out (they still hit the side of car) to exit. Door is too big and heavy. Toyota might be trying to appeal to younger buyer and may lose seniors if high beltline, heavy doors and entry/exit are not improved.  My husband who is 5'11"" cannot get into this car without extensive planning and exact maneuvering-not enough leg room for driver.

Excellent sedan for the money - maybe best on market.",1.Decrease width of car so driver and passenger can slide into seat and exit easily. 2. Decrease depth of dashboard so more room for driver. 3.

4.875,Glad I did not do the Lexus,Jim Meadows ,11/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"I tried to talk myself into the LS 460 or the ES350.  It came down to the ES, and I decided to save 10000 and still got a superior vehicle: more bells and whistles, better ride, more room (even larger in back seat than the 460) better gas mileage (average for us is almost 29) more power, regular gas.  The car is so smooth, the only thing I downgraded was ""fun to drive"".  I have a back problem and traded a cadillac to get something really comfortable.  This is it. My last three cars have been Cadillac SRX, Infiniti Q45, and Lexus LS 400. The Limited Avalon is superior to the Caddy, and equivalent of the 400 and 430 and Q45.  I cannot believe I got this much car for this price. ","XM, the ""no key needed"" to start and stop the car, or to open or lock the doors.  Unlike some others, I do not find the GPS to be a problem.

Now I'm a first time Toyota Avalon owner. I have a pearl white XLS. I reviewed the Limited as well, but decided the XLS had every option we needed as standard equipment plus we added heated seats.   Very pleased with the ride and the performance. A very classy looking vehicle. Have only run at 70mph with very little road noise. Looking forward to our first longer trip. This is going to be a great experience and we are looking forward to it. All I want to do is drive the car. ",The interior fits me perfectly. Great sound system.The design of the car from all angles is very sharp. Toyota knew what to put into the car to make the driver happy. ,"Include floor mats, pin stripes and side molding trim (afraid to park the car near other vehicles).

I have everything except nav because I use a portable GPS. The laser cruise control is awesome once you get use to it. I will have the body side molding installed once Toyota finds a new vendor. We also own a 2002 Highlander and Toyota quality and service cannot be matched. This is the best value on the road for a quality full size vehicle.  I have driven the lexus and aside from expensive options this car is as good as if not better than the Lexus.  I also love the fact I don't have to carry my keys only the fob to open and start the car.","Bluetooth, laser cruise control, keyless entry.",Install an auxiliary outlet on the side of the console under the dash.

Our three daughters love the back seat and think the reclining feature is the coolest thing. I'm impressed with fuel economy thus far. After 1000 miles, I am averaging 26 MPG city/highway. The engine has plenty of power, but the transmission seems to search for the proper gear when the gas pedal is mashed. Not an unsafe feeling, but car seems uncertain of how or when to shift. Ride is smooth and quiet. Despite being the Touring model, I wouldn't consider this a sports sedan. However, handling for a car this size is adequate. I do wish it had an integrated compass. Very happy overall.  ","Redesigned front end. Spacious interior. This automobile provides the best mix of performance, fuel economy and size for the money. No other car out there comes close.","Make the radio control backlighting match the rest of the controls. Everything has a nice white or blue hue, but the radio lighting is green.
