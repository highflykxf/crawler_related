4,Steer Away If You Want a Safe Car,Hayley ,08/24/2015,3,2,3,,,2,3,4,5,,,"I am 19 years old  and received this car as a birthday present less than 2 years ago, the car seemed great at first running fantastically until small little headaches started happening. First it was my keys getting stuck in the ignition when trying to turn the car off, i couldn't even go to class that day because i couldn't turn the car off. Then it was the multiple windows breaking in the car that would go down but then not come up (driver, passenger side, and driver's back window). The car did fairly well in the snow, coming from Connecticut we get our fair share- the car has good control but there's absolutely no weight to the car so i found myself skidding and struggling to get up hills. My last experience with this car was the accident i got in it about a week ago. I rear ended the back of a pick up truck on the highway going 40 miles per hour, easy to say my car was totaled. It was a horrifying experience because i felt no security in the car whatsoever when getting into the accident, there's so little to the car if i hit any harder the entire front of my car would've been gone probably. It's a cute, fun summer car that's nice to drive around if you live in the right conditions. But please take this from me, if you're considering buying your child this car, PLEASE look into better safety features. This car has absolutely no protection to it if you were to get in a serious accident.",,

I love the entertainment package and the MP3 option, when I am bored wtih everything else.

2.25,Got a Smoking Hot Deal!!,karinalynne ,01/05/2014,,,4,4,1,1,,1,3,1,3,"I bought this car less than a month ago, the second day I drove it, it stalled out at an intersection and I had to have it towed back to the dealership (burnt a coil and blew a fuse).Within a week later, the same thing happened again and again. Finally had to take it to a mechanic, said all 5 coils and spark plugs needed to be replaced.A week after that, I decided to just trade it in for something more reliable.On the way to the dealership, it stalled, started smoking and then caught on fire.It is now totaled and it is the worst car I have ever purchased. Save your time, its a cute car, but its NOT worth it.","Gets up to speed quick, when it runs.","Blows coils faster than you can replace them.
Then blows fuse and possibly melts the connector, concluding to never ending problems."
1.875,Never ever going back again,notlovingmybug ,10/29/2012,,,1,4,1,1,,1,2,1,4,"I consider this car a lesson learned in poor decisions.I purchased this car new in 2008 and have had numerous problems.So many in fact I'm not sure I can list much less remember them all.I will make this short (as possible) and sweet(as possible).The passenger side window motor stopped working, the radio buttons stick, the console top has broken twice, the compressor is barely working therefore I have almost zero air conditioning and the transmission is failing.Not to mention the car has an odd odor that I cannot get rid of.A light continually stays on that I was told needed a computer upgrade but the dealership never seemed to have the ""disc"".Too many problems to list.","Fun car to drive.
The ONLY good thing I can say is I was hit from behind by a Cadillac Escalade and the car took most of the impact.
My daughter and I were both very much ok and the Escalade took the impact much worse. That's it otherwise the car has been nothing but one problem after another.",

3.5,Not what I expected,maciosaig ,10/28/2009,,,3,5,5,5,,1,4,3,2,"I bought this car for my wife and after buying an 07 Passat and being extremely satisfied with that car I figured Id be just as pleased with the bug. Was I in for a shock I've owned convs in the past so I was away of frame/body flex but this car takes it to new extremes. The handling sucks, power is poor and comfort is great for the driver and front passenger, and my small 3 year just about fits in the back seat. Now there is a rattle in the front end somewhere and the thing is noisy on the highway. For the money they charge these cars should be much more powerful and handle better. I'm not sure how the fit and finish will stand up over the next few years, but I'm not confident",The retro look and power top,"Much more power, better fuel economy, better handling, better build quality, and much lower price-its built in Mexico with super low production costs there is no reason this car should cost this much. I would not recommend this car at all."

It is so easy to drive, and the seats are a good fit for me.  I have the automatic, so the gas mileage isn't the best, but I really love the experience of driving it every day.  This is the best car purchase we have ever had and I will likely own this car the rest of it's life!",The New Beetle is so distinctive and the salsa red really gets everyones attention.  I just love the way it looks!,"I would love to get better gas mileage and I think the car is very reliable, so the warranty should last longer."
4,Has been great!,eldaino2 ,09/19/2009,,,3,5,5,4,,3,4,4,4,"My wife's 08 beetle has been pretty great. its a fairly smooth riding car (an impressive feat considering its based of the mkIV platform and thus has a torsion beam rear suspension) and is a a great long distance cruiser. the stock tires are not the greatest and in typical stock fashion has grown loud and tiresome, but the car itself is very quiet, peppy with great low end tq, and style my wife loves.(and i actually don't mind it either.)","great shade of red, solid tuetonic driving experience, great highway cruiser, good range on gas tank, fairly inexpensive to maintain, decent steering feel, low end torque, engine growl.","armrest location, cup holder placement is slightly weird, a chassis this stout and that weighs this much should get better rear seat side impact ratings. (maybe actual airbags back there? only a big deal if you carry people in the back, in our case thats a no.)"

5,Great Time Travel,OBX  NC ,01/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Love the car, brings back super memories, makes the day fun and exciting.  . My fuel mileage averages 25-29 mpg without pampering.  Have owned a Miata, will take the Beetle any day,anytime.  ","The heated front seats, great on cold mornings or just to ride with top down on cool days.  Harvest moon beige, cream top with cream interior is just a fabulous color combination. ","The adjustable armrest is difficult to lower, the release button is difficult to reach.  The car tends to bottom out on minor bumps. Some utility of the large dash would be of benefit(storage or bin)."
5,LUV BUG :),Beach Girl  ,11/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased my brand new 2008 Convertible Beetle and love it !

","1) heated leather seats. 2) stereo & comes with Sirius Sat Radio. 3) fun to drive , and you can fit it anywhere not a big bulky car. 4) has a convertible top you gotta love that. 5) I like the turn signals on the side mirrors that helps out. 6) FLOWER holder lol ha ha ",just a lil rough when hits bumps but i have heard that all VWs are like that. 
3,The Volkswagen Co. Not What It Used To Be,George Lafont ,10/18/2008,,,3,5,1,1,,4,3,3,4,"Day one from picking up the car from the dealer the handbrake came off when I parked. The car doesn't feel at all like a German car, in fact it feels like it's coming apart. About 2 months later on my way home (45 min. commute) on a very hot Summer day, the underneath engine cover came loose fell off and broke into many pieces. When I took it to the dealer, they accused me of running into something and refused to fix it. The service manager even went through the trouble of fabricating a story that I ran over a parking turtarrier with a piece of rebar sticking out tearing the cover off and again refused. Both their customer service and chairman of the board also refused to help ",At this point I'm disgusted with the car.,Build them in Germany not Mexico and be responsible of your car's defects.

4.875,A Slice of Heaven in every Ride,Ireland3 ,08/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased the yellow SE in July and have been driving it everyday just smiling. The handling is great,and the seats are comfortable. I just love all the fun it is to simply go anywhere now in my new ""Sunflower Yellow"" bug. Gets tons of compliments and fits in the smallest spots. I updated mine with ""daisy"" steering wheel covers, flower vase, license plate, and seat covers for an even cuter look.","The way it handles, so smooth and secure, the color, and the shape of the car. The gas mileage is average esp. since it contains 6 airbags and has a big engine.","A door for the back seat passenger to get in easily. Maybe one that opens to the back of the car, and rear windows that open also."
5,cyn in florida,beetle girl ,08/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I love this car; but triple with the white arm rest is whacked. Could get a little better gas mileage.,Feels like a girl car.,Change the arm rest to black or metal to hard to keep clean.
3.125,Low Quality but cute,Ed Rooney ,08/04/2008,,,4,4,1,4,,4,3,2,3,"We purchased a 2008 ""S"" with automatic about 3 months ago for my wife, with the intent of passing it on to our daughter next year.  I was reluctant to purchase this car based on customer reviews of previous model years.  I should have listened, because this piece of junk has been in the shop 4 times to fix various squeaks and rattles and we haven't even had the first oil change yet.  So far gas mileage has been in the 22-24 mpg range, mostly suburban driving.  While it's within the EPA estimates, it's still low for a car this small.  Did I mention that it requires synthetic oil and a filter not carried at any quick lube establishments?    ",It's a cute car and my wife gets lots of compliments on it.,"Improve the fuel economy and build quality.  Seats in the ""S"" model provide no lumbar support."
5,Fun Car,Catherine ,07/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Nice fun car - gas mileage could be somewhat better.  The triple white model is really fun.  I like the solid feel of the way it drives - tight.   I especially like the blinker system where the blinker is also on the outside mirrors.  Outside lighting of the car is well done as well.,Blinkers and the so-called leather seats.,Gas mileage could improve
5,2008 Convertible - Fun fun fun,Belaircarguy ,07/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought a beautiful black with cream interior SE model a few weeks ago. Purchased this mainly for my daughters to drive, although I have to admit the old man likes it too!  Haven't had a VW for a number of years, but they were always a fun car to drive, and this convertible is no exception.  The SE comes with a power top, so makes it much easier for raising and lowering the roof.  The car has plenty of pep and the Tiptronic 6 speed manual / automatic transmission is a pleasure.  I also like  being able to set it to ""sport mode"", where the transmission holds the shift pattern to higher RPM setting. Good handling as a touring vehicle and sure stopping brakes. Great little car!","Tiptronic 6 speed transmission is great, power top, comfortable seats.  This car came with a beautiful Monsoon stereo, which included a CD player as well as satellite (Sirius) radio.  Have a Sirius satellite radio in another car, and got this hooked up right away - great sound!","When the top is up, there is a big blind spot at the right rear, but I guess with the convertible mechanism there was some compromise with visibility.  Otherwise - everything else is great on this car."
4.875,2008 VW New Beetle COnvertible,JonF ,06/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a fun, stylish car that is a ""blast from the past""!  It has the classic Beetle lines with the luxury of a Mercedes.  This car is fun to drive, inexpensive to operate - I have been getting 33 - 35 MPG - but the AC kills the mileage - down to about 24 MPG with the AC running).  It has lots of ""get up and go"" with acceleration onto highways rapid and sure.  Interior space is great - I am 6'1"" and fit quite comfortably in the back seat.  I had two Mazda MX-5s prior to this VW and the VW wins hands down - for value, for comfort, with comparable handling and VERY much better when the roads are slippery.  This is a delightful car - My wife liked it so much, she bought one for herself!  ","The Tiptronic is great for someone who drove a stick all his life - the convenience of an automatic with the fun of a stick.  The dash read-outs are plain and simple with colors that are easy on the eyes.  I was able to get my choice colors, and the finish is great.  All around great car.",Add oil pressure and temperature gauges. Make power seats and a power top standard. The top needs an easier lock-down as shorter people have lots of trouble with leverage.  Tonneau covers should also be standard - over $400 is way too expensive for this. Include rug mats with cold weather pkg. 
5,The Bestest Car Ever!,"Lane,D ",06/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My mother went and bought this car for her Birthday and we have loved every cotton-pickin' minute of having it. It gets pretty good gas mileage. You would think that a small car like the Beetle-bug would be really tiny in the backseat, but it is really comfortable.It is the best car that our family has ever had. I also think it is really cool to have a car that there are only 1,400 of in the whole United States. ",One of our favorite features probably is going to be is the moon roof. You can adjust it to your favorite way. So it doesn't have to be fully open or fully closed!,I think that the car is just perfect the way it is!
5,Great Commuter,Robert Alyea ,06/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,My first beetle was purchased in 1966 that was a great car but this one is even better.  I drive 150 miles a day back and forth from work.  The comfort and ride are exceptional and the car actually has a passing gear.  The car has excellent pick up and I am experiencing a little over 30 mpg.  I get a lot of looks and have referred many to the dealership.  Thanks for providing such a wonderful vehicle it is what I need and also fun.,The car has the ability to get up to 70 mph very quickly and has no loss of power with A/C on.  It is very easy to put the rear seat down for additional cargo space.  The cruise control is the best I have had on any car.  ,None.  I love my bug!!!
5,2008 New Beetle Fun To Drive,Stanley ,06/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I gave my 2004 Toyota Camry to my son and I purchased a Red Beetle with a Black top. I have owned my car for two months and I just love it. I shopped around for a convertible car that is fun to drive. The New Beetle is perfect. The gas mileage is not as good but is so much more fun to drive. My husband is a large guy over six feet tall. He has enough room in this car but back seats are for small children. He was not sure about a small car but he fell in love with it too. When I was sixteen my Dad had one of the old beetles they have made alot of improvements. Great job VW. People stop me all the time and tell me how much they like my car.,Heated seats and how the car looks with the top down. Radio sounds great even with top down.,Power seats and maybe a faster sport model.
3.625,2008 New Beetle YUCK!,Beverly DuVall ,03/29/2008,,,5,5,1,2,,5,5,1,5,"I have owned 6 Beetles in my lifetime and I have loved everyone from my 1968 to my 2005.  I recently traded in my 2005 and upgraded to a 2008.  What a shock.  The appearance and features are all basically the same as all my other New Beetles, however, the gas mileage is another story.  I have paid more for gas than I have in payments for this car since I purchased it.  It is only averaging 200 miles per tank of gas.  I have had it to the dealership for service, and they insist that there is no problem with it.  My last full tank of gas I got 193 miles.  I am certain that there is a problem with the 2008 Beetle fuel system. I am not happy with the 08 VW. YUCK!!!",My favorite feature would have to be the heated seats.  Love them!!, VW needs to fix the fuel problem with the 2008 Beetles.

This car looks small from the outside, not so when you get in.  With tilt and telescopic steering wheel and three way adjustable seats, comfort comes easily, making entry and exit a breeze.  Tiptronic is fun, the heated seats are hot, 6-disc CD changer/Sirius is cool, 17"" low profile tires give it a great look.  Lots of head room too.  I got triple-white  and love it.  I threw out the flower holder.","Comfort, radio, tiptronic, interior.",Fold-down rear seat without taking out headrests.
4.875,2008 New Beetle Conv,airbornediver ,11/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I traded a 2004 VW Touareg for this conv. I love my new Beetle. I got the triple black model. It gets attention everywhere I go. The 150 HP engine has enough juice to move. It would be nice if they had a turbo. Maybe they will come out with a sport model. I miss all the comfort features that the Touareg had. Power seats and lumbar would be nice. Also a nav system. I ride hard all the time so fuel economy is not the best. No this car is lots of fun to drive. It beats my Touareg in that department. Having a rag top is awesome. That is the main reason why I got my new convertible. It needs some nicer wheels. I'll be investing in some chrome wheels soon to bring out the bold looks on this bug!,"The semi top. It not only works great, but looks very cool when it is down. It has that Cali look. I also love the bold looks of this bug. It can be considered cute or bold looking depending on how you trick it out. ","For sure a sport model with turbo, bigger wheels and brakes. "
