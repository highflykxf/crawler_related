1,"Don't Drive Away With This Car, Run From It!!!",Exhausted Mini Owner ,09/21/2016,1,2,4,,,1,2,3,3,,,"So, when I was in the market for a new car, a Mini Cooper S Convertible caught my eye.  I have always liked Minis, and this car fit my personality to a 'T' (or so I thought).  All was well, for about a month.  I took it to the shop after I bought it to have them look over an issue I was having with brakes squeaking.  I need new front brakes; also, there were about $3000 worth of repairs that my car needed because I had holes in my oil line, and all other types of issues.  This took me two trips to the dealership to get all of these taken care of.  We will consider those my fault for buying a lemon, without taking it to the dealership before buying it.  With those repairs out of the way, over the next two years I have taken my Mini to the dealership over a dozen times.  I have had the wiring fixed, I have had a new throttle body installed, I have had to have the entire front end realigned and fixed because rain was just coming right into my convertible top, and had this weird possession episode where my tachometer was telling the rest of my lights and functions to freak out and come on at random.  I breaks down at random, and then will work for a couple of weeks, only for the issue to come up again, or another one to rear its ugly head.  I purchased my car in Jan 2014, it is now Sep 2016, I have paid for my car more than twice now!!!!!  Don't walk, run, run far far far away from this car.  The times it does work, I love it, it is so fun to drive.  But, if you are the type of person that wants to know if you are going to make if from point A to B...ever, don't buy it.",,
1,a blissful honeymoon led to a nasty divorce,stanley m heath ,06/12/2016,1,2,3,,,1,3,5,2,,,"BMW seems determined to make Mini owners tethered to their Mini dealership service departments. There are no instructions for owner maintainence and the instructions for resetting the stupid computer for things as simple as inflating the tires are either incomplete or unintelligible. Oil change intervals of 15,000 miles are too long and only contribute to more trips to the dealer in the long run as the engine wears out. Every Mini owner can attest to the utter worthlessness of the run flat tires. Harsh ride and expensive to replace I put conventional radials on and it made big improvement. For a ""sports"" car with all the electronics I""d expect and oil pressure gauge and a temperature gauge at the minimum, but apparently BMW engineers knew better. I bought my Cooper S with 13,000 miles and never got the Email regarding the recall for timing belt tensioner replacement until mine imploded at 30,000 miles. The local dealer was willing to replace mine, but up until that moment I'd never had oil consumption problems. Since then it burned through 2 qts. in 5000 miles. Coincidence? I think the fragments from the tensioner ruined the internal parts of the engine. The driving experience is indeed exhilarating, but beware the dealer cost for service can offset the fun factor real quick. I will not buy another Mini or any other BMW product or recommend them to anyone else. Run the other way",,
2,So much fun - and oh so not worth it in the end...,Scott England ,12/08/2015,2,4,3,,,1,3,4,3,,,"Look I'll make this brief and simple. If you are reading this and other posts you should have an idea now that the Mini is a blast to drive. And you will pay and pay for the constant repairs to enjoy that go-kart feel. The reliability on these cars is abysmal - period. Something is always leaking, breaking or needs replacing. The little turbo simply just eats things up and you will be in the ""repair"" tunnel of hell once things go south. And they will sooner then later. I simply can't recommend these cars until BMW makes a significant commitment to improving quality. Save yourself heartache and go get a new Mazda Miata.",,
5,mini car with GIANT aspirations fulfilled!,Chris ,12/01/2015,5,5,4,,,5,5,5,5,,,"This car is a great car ive driven both the type s and reg mini cooper and they are both fun but the type s is way more fun!

The car is absolutely a blast to drive yeah ok for the first split second there's a tttiiinnnyyy bit of lag(maybe til like 1200-1500 rpms) but after it pulls harder and harder, also noise complaints??? The only noise i heard was the great roar of this four cylinder turbo screaming down the road as if it were warning the other cars to get out of my way!!! This car has GREAT POTENTIAL compared to any other cars, whether price range or in its class!  Lastly as for those who complained about the ""stiff ride"", one question for you?, Have you ever rode in a car with performance suspension before???, yeah its supposed to be stiffer for handling purposes!!!  So quit being a stiff yourself and just drive the darn thing like its meant to be driven!!!  Moreover this might be a ""mini car"" but its a GIANT KILLER that i feel has fulfilled GIANT aspirations!!!  GREAT CAR!!! (In my own opine the only thing that would make this car better would be a blow off to hear that ppssshhh, to give the car a bit more attitude like pppsssshhhhh please get out of my way!!!)",,

If you live in Florida where the roads have no expansion joints, then you will probably be ok with the OEM tires.
Great design interior and exterior but not 100% sure if the big speedometer in the middle is that great of an idea for function.
Lots of room in the front seats and head room, so taller people can actually use this little car.
Better legroom than my old Cadillac but person in back seat has to be a kid.
Gas mileage is decent at about 30 mpg with mixed use, but mainly highway.
","Softer tires for sure.
Also, the dealer will offer to replace your W/S wipers at about the 24 month mark & will ask around $80 to do it.
Buy them yourself at Walmart for $15.
Mini should provide a manual on how to get into the computer module and reset items for those who want that ability, but a lot of that stuff is on line on videos on Youtube.
Windshield will collect very small rock chips through the years, maybe get some sort of wind deflector?

It's a noisy vehicle, and the Panoramic roofs all seem to leak air and make a lot of noise as you drive.
I've been in several different ones and that seems to be typical except when brand new.

I took off the 17"" wheels & tires and put on oversize 16"" wheels & tires and then could really enjoy the ride.

It is a very small car, and while likely the best in its class, we found it cramped, noisey, rattley and poor riding, especially on road trips. The run-flat tires are bricks, the premium stereo was fair at best, it was nearly impossible to get comfortable (no,we aren't big people), and I really didn't care for the valve rattle at start-up on cold days.  I switched to a Camry SE V6 which is (yes) faster, more refined, has far nicer/more of ""everything"", and for about the same money. If you need to drive regularly, long distances or with others, don't buy a Cooper","Looks, novelty, heated seats, DSC, big sunroof, BRG color and stripes, gen build quality and fun factor for quick around town trips.

Save yourself some money and stay with the OEM. Just about everyplace I park my MINI, people compliment it. My wife has an 06 Miata MX-5. Both cars have almost the same performance stats, but really feel different. The MX-5 is so smooth and natural. The MINI feels like every second it looks for a fight! What fun! Watch out for the options you order A $23K car cost over $40K easily Have fun!",Uniqueness. I could order it any way I wanted. Nav-system and voice recognition are light years ahead of my Lexus. Very easy to use. Road feel and handling great! 0 mph to trouble in less than 6 seconds. Back has plenty of room for shopping. It has an 'identity' that other cars lack. ATTITUDE!!,"Try to smooth out the 'torque steer' on acceleration, but no big deal. More power never hurts although with the JCW Perf Package, it really 'rocks'.

I regularly drive 2- 3 hour trips and found this car to be harsh riding, noisy and rattley. The small tires and wheels were simply no match for the rough roads around Ohio and Michigan.

Leather, stereo, ergonomics are excellent (I'm 6'3""). Automatic climate control works well and doesn't bog the engine at all. Looking up at Civics and Priuses in traffic took some getting used to, but if I don't want to look at them I don't have to - punch it and watch them get smaller.  ","Performance and handling. The high beams will scorch paint. The stereo sound is awesome. A bag of chips, a bottle of water, and change from my $20 bill after filling up with no-lead primo is pretty cool too.

5,When I Press the Start Button!,TOMCAT ,03/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Ah! I have finally found the car I so dreamed of. Namely a car (to borrow the words of another automobile ad) when I 'press the Start Button' it presses my 'start button'! I traded in a 'perfect' 2007 Lexus RX 350 for the Mini. The Lexus was just too 'boring to drive. I wanted something with 'attitude'! With a doubt my MINI Cooper S is it! The only cars I can remember that I've owned that were this much fun and excitng to drive were my 1973 BMW 2002 Tii or my 1972 Capri (from Germany V- 6)!  Yes its ride is a bit 'taut', but if you're looking for a smooth ride, but a Lexus or a Buick. Everyplace I go, people stop to look and ask or compliment me about it. In short, I love my MINI! ",The 'BMW' quality you find everyplace. My ability to order the car practically any way I wanted. Its 'singularity' as in you don't see many around. The sound system you get in the S model and a much easier to use than others NAV System. The ergonomics!,"Maybe a power operated hatch or seats, but that would probably spoil for me the simplicity of the car which so endears it to me. I might think of something, but not yet."
5,The Best trade-in Ever,Timo ,02/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We took ownership of this vehicle a mere ten days ago. We traded in 2002 Saturn. The Mini Coopers S is 100X different and better than the Saturn. My biggest worry was storage space. All of our groceries fit into the car. The drive is like being a rat in a chase. It moves flawlessly through traffic and poor weather.,Easy to manage dashboard controls. Cold weather package. Power folding mirrors. Heated mirrors and washer jets. Heated front seats.
