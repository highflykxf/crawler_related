4.375,Very Nice,Family Man ,02/22/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,1,5,I have now been driving this Truck for a 2 weeks. I did a small road trip around 400 mile. This truck has a very smooth ride. I would compare to more of a sedan ride. The technology is very user friendly. The cabin is loaded with comfort. The 3rd row is great for little kids which I have. The Dvd is nice and the back cabin heater/ac. The captain chairs in the 2nd row are very nice along with the push button seats. The drivers control area is well thought out. The only real problem with the Truck is the fuel economy. I am getting 11 mpg in city and 16 mgp highway. One has to be able to afford the gas. If  you are driving more than 1000 miles a month I would not buy this truck. ,The sonor for the cruise control might be the coolest thing since navi. to come out. The smooth ride for a truck this big is awesome. User friendly technology. Very Safe truck. The overall luxury is top of its class. ,"Fuel Economy. I bought the truck thinking I was going to get around 14 mpg. I am getting 11 in the city and I am driving slow with 2 wheel drive on. On the radio you can only program 6 channels. On a $61,000 truck I should be able to program 12. "

The 08 interior upgrade is dramatic and makes this truly feel like a luxury SUV.  Lots of technology/luxury (HID lights, keyless start, HDD Navi, Front/Rear Sonar, intelligent cruise control, rear Camera, heated steering wheel, power 3rd row seat etc.) that make this truck feel like a million bucks. The interior is very flexible. We have the bench seat and 2 car seats and can still get 2-3 adults in the 3rd row. We take several trips/year from VA to HH, SC and can get 16/17 MPG even w/Thule box on top. No issues with reliabilty","Heated steering wheel, keyless go, Hard Drive Navi with traffic alerts, front/rear sonar, intelligent cruise control, tons of room.  Top notch fit/finish.  Great dealer experience and excellent reliability",The styling is ok- it has a face only a mother could love.  Then again my wife (who has great taste in things- at least besides her choice in husbands) thinks that it looks classy yet tough and capable.

3.75,Amazing Truck,Mike Penfold ,05/18/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,2,3,"The truck is great, I purchased it to replace my 07 EXT due to a baby on the way.  I needed something with better crash ratings.  The funny thing is that two days after purchasing the truck, a 75FT tree fell across the highway and I had to go through it at 75MPH.  If I were to have the GM, I would most likely not be typing this.  This truck saved my wife's and my life.  I added a remote starter on the truck. A bit pricey, but extremely useful. Also added an I-Pod attachment that plays video and made it so that I can control the GPS and watch video while driving.","Hands down, the crash rating.  Next up would be the size.

Far more luxurious and full-featured than any other large SUV other than the Range Rover.  Everything is well thought out.  The exterior is handsome, especially the gigantic chrome grill and chrome roof racks.  These trucks are rare enough to continually look fresh, unlike say an X5. At 5000 mile it is still solid, rattle-free, and a joy to drive.  I don't think there is a better large SUV out there at any price.","Prestigious-looking front grill. Gorgeous wood dash/door accents.  Separate folding/removable middle seat in the middle row (acts like a pass- through for kids, or can fold up for 8-passenger seating). Power fold-flat 3rd row. Logical controls. Quality feel everywhere. Simple Nav screen. Bluetooth.","Storage behind 3rd row seats would be easier to use without the lift-up hideaway.  I would also prefer a split rear hatch like the LX570.  Running boards could be a bit sturdier.  Parking sensors should be in front bumper too, not just rear bumper.

We made deal on 2007 then they got their first 2008 in, one look and I had to have it! changes are incredible and the 2008 QX should be SUV of the year. Beautiful inside, beautiful out...we love all the chrome! Luxury top notch. Love the bluetooth capability, the power 3rd row seats, intellicruise, music box is awesome. I buy all my songs on itunes and then load them in, we love that feature! Leather is beautiful, controls are perfectly placed and the power of this baby is hard to beat. First time I stepped on the gas, it gave new meaning to 'stepping on it'. I feel safe with my children in this SUV and we couldn't be happier to be driving this SUV. It deserves more credit!","Music Box, 20 inch wheels, chrome details, gorgeous leather and wood trim, design, intelicruise, bluetooth, power 3rd row, great sunroom... this car has it all. You just cant beat it!",The only negative is gas mileage but that is typical for powerful SUVs. I had a Suburban for 5 years and this is just about the same as that.
4.875,"Best Large Luxury SUV, Period",Luv QX56 ,03/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We travel a lot with 2 very tall kids.  So when searching for a large SUV, rear legroom is a must.  Having looked at all the typical choices (GMC, Chevy, Ford, Cadillac, Toyota, Lexus) once we looked at the Infiniti, nothing else came close.  The number of options that are standard are amazing (i.e. heated steering wheel, rear heated seats, auto fold side mirrors, power 3rd row seats, power liftgate, etc.).  The interior design and legroom of the QX56 are far superior to the others.  The space behind the 3rd row seat is somewhat limited, but rarely do we use that seat.  Mileage isn't great, averaging about 15 mpg between city/highway driving, but I knew that going into the purchase.","Heated steering wheel, navigation system, power folding outside mirrors, power liftgate, high quality interior, very comfortable seats throughout.","Gas mileage could use some help, but other than that, this thing has it all."
4.75,The Only SUV You Need,murphdog ,03/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I just traded an 04 for an 08. You can't believe how different the two are. The 08 has been elegantly refreshed with wood, heated steering, Bluetooth, Power rear seats, etc etc.  I didn't believe they could improve on the 04, which I thought was a great truck..but they did. The ride is far superior to the 04. The nav, DVD, XM, 20"" wheels are all tremendous improvements.  We have driven them all... Escalade, Denali, Range Rover, Navigator - nothing holds a candle to this car.  ",Everything,Nothing
4.75,Best vehicle purchase ever,Dan ,03/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"This is the 4th SUV we have owned and by far the finest.  We loked at every large SUV available up to the $83K Lexus 570.  And the value proposition of the QX56 was the best of class.  Fit and finish is exceptional.  It is a fun vehicle whose style is really coming into its own.  Many think it was years ahead of its time when it was first introduced, but with the upgrades and minor front and rear fascia changes for 2008, is now just plain beautiful.","Ride quality, fit and finish, interior amenities, and style.  Longer wheel base than others in this class for a smoother ride.  2nd row legroom unmatched by any other large SUV.",Put a pocket on the back of the front pasenger seat.  Add AC to the front seats.  Pad the lower half of the doors on the inside.  Move away from premium fuel.
4.875,The Best of the Best,Jeff C ,02/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I owned a 2004 (first year model) and had several problems with it.  I finally decided to get a new one to take advantage of all the modifications and upgrades.  Boy were there a lot of them. From the much more luxurious interior (more wood grain) to folding mirrors with directional signal, heated steering wheel, larger DVD screen, power rear seat, larger wheels.... and the list goes on and on.  They did everything right and I am in love with my 2008.","As mentioned above, larger wheels, heated steering wheel, folding mirrors, etc. Also love the music box.","Wood steering wheel with heat.  Got rid of the wood, I really thought it was classy. Gas MPG also dropped a bit from my 2004. Also miss my 6 disc changer, I like the music box but can't it have both?"
5,THE BEST LARGE LUXURY SUV UNDER $60K,xxxACExxx ,02/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got 3 kids and my wife doesn't want a minivan. The QX56 is a true LUXURY SUV and I think it's the best deal out there for the price.  If you are looking for a large luxury SUV for your family, I would suggest the QX56.  It has all the bells and whistles included in the price except for nav and Tech Package. Not like other company with extra options can raise the price another 10K.","20"" wheel, plenty of room, keyless start, intelligent cruise control, Bluetooth, HID light, 3 years free XM radio & traffic, music box 10GB, and best of all, it look awesome and luxurious.  Best deal for the buck luxury SUV.","More power is always better, less cabin noise from acceleration, push button keyless start, remote starter, larger DVD (10"" or dual DVD) and 9"" nav LCD, 6 speed automatic transmission, cool box, telescopic xteering wheel, more wood trim interior, more storage space, 4 zone climate."
4.875,Awesome,George ,01/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I am loving my new QX. I got it at the start of the new year. It has been great. I have 4 children and they fit very well. The 3rd row has theater seating so seeing the DVD is no problem. The ride is very smooth. It is as close to a sedan as any full size SUV I have been in. It has power to spare. Passing on 2 lane highways is a breeze. The cabin is very quiet despite the big 20in wheels. It has been great on the snow traction with the variable 4 wheel drive.,This is a luxury vehicle with all the bells and whistles but it has the room and power to do work and carry a family of 6 comfortably for long distances.,I would give the second row bench seats the ability to slide forward to increase the leg room in the back seat. The third row is perfect for kids but a 6 foot adult couldn't stand a very long trip.
4.875,TOP SUV ,Jasonthebomb ,01/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have just purchased this monster about a month and meets all my satisfaction. I traded in my 04 4Runner and got this beast and I am loving it. It has it all, power, fun, and look impressive. When I drive the road, people just keep looking at my car and asking how much I paid and so on on when it is parked. It is one hell of big impressive SUV and washing my car every weekend YAY! \(^.^)/","Navigation, backup camera, sensors, keyless start, voice commands, roomy, smooth, quick, and COMFORTABLE",hmmm.. fuel? 
4.875,QX56: Best Luxury SUV in the World,QX ,11/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just purchased my '08 QX and am completely in love w/it. I am a definite car enthusiast and there is simply no SUV that provides a better overall package of luxury and amenities in the world. It delivers powerful performance, it's very smooth and quiet on the road, the list of features is astounding, and it looks gorgeous. I test drove an Escalade. There is no comparison. The QX56 is smoother, quieter, has a lot more features, and actually provides better performance and quicker response than the Escalade.","Navigation system, backup camera, power liftgate, front parking sensors, intelligent key, voice commands, music box, bluetooth, intelligent cruise control, power third row, strong V8 engine, vehicle dynamic control, comfortable leather seating, First class legroom throughout, smooth & quiet ride.","Fuel economy is obviously not hybrid level, but it's what you'd expect from a massive SUV with a powerful V8 engine."
5,"Big, Beautiful & The Best",BD ,10/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my second Q and the difference between the two is substantial - previously owned a 2005. Infiniti has introduced to the market the quintessential SUV: style; comfort; luxury ride; quiet; technology; driving pleasure; smooth power; outstanding price point. I tested and researched all SUVs and literally there is no comparison. Those in the market for a SUV, all they have to do is test drive the Q and they will say the same. The Q56 has no rival and should be the SUV of the Year!",Technology package - the navigation and phone system are incredible. ,I miss the wood grain accent steering wheel. Infiniti should give you an option between heated and non heated steering wheel. I prefer the Homelink buttons on the overhead panel versus the rearview mirror.
4.625,The best Big SUV on the market,HHK ,09/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"Had the car for 45 days.  Love it.  Excellent fit and finish and gadgetry for the price (or any).  Finally a big SUV with 20"" rims standard (hated large cars with tiny wheels and empty wheel well).  Entertainment center is an afterthought and not as well integrated (placed in the center console instead of the front dashboard, screens are not in headrest, plays only one dvd, interface not easily accessible), hence it's an option.  Puts the Escalade ESV to shame (loud over priced truck) for 20K less.  Handles like a large sedan, not a truck.","Luxurious, comfort, no key start, 20"" wheels, power third row, HDD, Bluetooth functionality.","Entertainment system is afterthought (single dvd, player in center console instead of dash, no headrest screens, interface not as easily accessible). Needs improvement."
4.5,"Excellent SUV, BUT...",H in Houston ,09/11/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"We just got our new QX.  We really liked what we tested drove and ordered one.  We are pleased with the car overall.  If you want a BIG SUV, this is it. We had a Navigator before. It started falling apart at 48k miles. We looked at and/or drove the Escalade, Yukon Denali, GL 450 and LX 470. For the price and features, you can't beat the QX. What other SUV includes as standard equipment a moonroof, Bluetooth, power fold flat seats, 20 inch chrome wheels, a navigation system, HID lights, a harddrive for music that rips CDs, a rear camera and rear sonar. While others may not care for the looks, I think it has one of the nicest interiors. ",Being able to rip CDs is great although transfering them from the CF card would be better.,
4.375,Has all of the bells and whistles!,Sally ,09/04/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,2,5,"I got the new '08 QX56 as soon as it came out, I have about 500 miles on the car, I was waiting b/c improvements are so great over the '07. I traded in an Odyssey van. While the QX is true luxury, I have to say the Odyssey handles more smoothly on the road. I love the interior of the QX as well as all of the bells/whistles re: technology. I've only figured out about 60% of the features.  In addition to the roughness on the road, I was also surprised by the engine noise/vibration under driver's seat while accelerating; I suppose that's due to the huge engine size.","Bluetooth compatibility, navigation is awesome, XM radio and related stereo functions, power back hatch/trunk, power 3rd row seat, memory seat settings.","Squeaky motor in 60% rear seat when going down, engine noise under driver seat, feeling every bump on an uneven road."
3.75,Big disappointment,amber ,08/18/2007,,,5,3,4,4,,4,4,2,4,"I just turned in my 04 Armada, got the 08 QX56, looking forward to a great sound system with all my music on the hardrive. Alas, I did not research it enough because I couldn't find any info it. Hardrive can only be loaded by recording CDs to it.Takes forever. I have no CDs anymore.The Compact Flash Medium is ill-conceived/junk. Infiniti sales people must have been told to play dumb because none of them acknowledge what a limited feature this is. Single CD player only. None of this info anywhere on website or marketing materials.  I would not pay an extra nickel for it. Buy the Armada and don't option it. I had brake issues on the 04, I hope that is done with.","Traffic info is good, much tighter fits than the 04 I had, front and rear collision beeper/camera. Best full-size SUV floorplan.",Make hardrive able to record from the Compact Flash(mpeg files). Better tunes mgmt. Put in remote start instead of touch-open door handles. Aftermarket remote start cannot be done - need it in Jan/MN.
4.5,Love it!,branfordboater ,08/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,4,"The most comfortable, powerful, well equipped SUV that I have ever owned and I have owned them all.  Highly recommended, unless you are not a fan of the gas pump.","The big engine, hard drive for music, power third row seats and lift gate, XM traffic, and exterior styling",Make the navigation a little bit easier to use while underway; it limits what you can do while in motion too much.
4.625,It's a beast,John Cincy ,07/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"Just bought this beast a couple weeks ago and love it.  My wife carts the kids around in it mostly but I have had some fun in it too.  Very easy to drive and tons more room than the Escalade ESV. Gonna cost me a ton in gas - wish they had the Flex Fuel option.  From last year, they added a heated steering wheel, automatic fold down third row (folds flat), 10 GB hard drive, compact flash drive, aux jack for iPods, MP3 players, etc., and bigger 20"" wheels.  ","10 GB hard drive to download your cds (even stores the song names, artist, and album). Touch screen navigation along with voice recognition. Tons of leg and head room - I'm 6'7"" and am very comfortable in 1st and 2nd row and can also fit in the 3rd row ok.",Locking gas lid. Ability to have DVD sound come out of rear speakers while I listen to music on the fronts - my kids are too young to wear headphones. Need the Flex Fuel option like on the Armada.
4.875,It is just the best,Guillermo ,06/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought this big SUV days ago and it is the best car I ever had. The comfort, technology, engine response and features are way ahead any other SUV at this moment. The new features on the 08 model are exactly the ones I expected and the reason why I never bought a QX before. My previous car was an FX35 which I loved too, but it was kind of small for my family. I highly recommend this vehicle for a test drive, I am sure you won't be disappointed. The ride is much better than the previous version with the improved tire quality (Michelin) and 20"" rims. The traffic feature helps you to avoid congested areas and is easy to use. The downside is fuel economy.","Voice command system, navigation traffic report, navigation touch screen and wheel controller, interior materials and details, bluetooth phone system.","Fuel economy, bigger storage compartments, telescopic wheel drive."
