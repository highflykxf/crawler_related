It now has 95,000 miles on it and I plan to keep for a long time.  I have learned that it runs much smoother on 93 octane Shell gasoline.  The only issue I have is the tire pressure light is on and numerous people have tried to make it go away with no success...BMW dealership does not recommend spending the money it would cost to clear it.

2,Never Again,Mackenzie ,12/09/2015,2,3,5,,,1,4,2,3,,,"I just got my 2008 BMW X3 a few months ago back in April. I bought it off a used lot and as I drove away, the engine light came on. I've taken it in multiple times and I've had everything from my radio just suddenly not wanting to work to my car cutting off in the middle of a busy intersection. This car has almost gotten me in many accidents with its poor driving performance. I actually had it in the shop for a week during Thanksgiving and as soon as I got it back it broke down and left me stranded the day after. I got it back to the repair place and it magically had 10+ new issues. We have spent well over 3k in the past few weeks on this vehicle. I would absolutely never suggest this car to anyone especially as their first car unless you want to constantly have your car in the shop and 0 money in  your wallet. I will never purchase a BMW ever again. They say to get rid of a BMW once it hits 85,000 miles... I should have listened.Oh, and not to mention its HORRIBLE gas mileage. I fill up every week and it costs around 50 bucks every time. It's ridiculous.",,

Lucky enough to find a rare 6 speed manual, which sold me from the get go and unfortunately the dealership knew as in their words ""we have 2 other people with cash in hand willing to buy the car sight unseen"", and I believed them, but still got a fair deal.  So far I haven't any electronic or sun roof issues which I understand come with the territory.  Obviously can't speak to the automatic shifting complaints that are out there but I can say the 6 speed manual shifts like butter.  In summary, the 2008 X3 is roomy enough for the family and fun enough for Dad to drive.  The interior is appealing to the eye and logically laid out.  My only complaint is that they stopped offering the 6 speed option after 2010 or I would have bought new.Update: one year since this review and I haven't had a single issue with this car, still lovin it, can't wait to tackle the coming Winter!",,

I purched the car from BMW as a certified used car and had trouble with it from the beginning.

By 21K, the tapping reduced to a soft finger strumming, it still taps, but I deal with it.  The engine strains on small & big hills & fails to shift.

The new 3.0si engine that was put into X3 beginning in 2007 flat out rips with 260 HP.

4.875,Good Vehicle,sgarg ,03/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Purchased in march. Nice car. Looks are attractive. Features are excellent except navigation system. Navigation system is really bad, Honda has much much better nav system. Fuel avg is around 17-18.","Auto light, auto viper, Blue tooth, sound system.",Navigation system has to be improved.
4.875,Enjoying New BMW,New X3 Owner ,03/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Purchased in Feb.  Terrific ride - very comfortable.  The oversized sunroof is a real plus.  Ordered Premium Package, rear side airbags, mats, heated front seats, metallic color.  Nice ride:  car performs beautifully.  So far, shows I'm only getting 15.6 miles to gallon, although alot of street driving.  No hesitation as mentioned in another post.  Very powerful and sensitive brakes.  This is a feature added as I read it's designed to perform right away.  Very roomy although rear has hump in middle seat.  The technology over just a few years ago is amazing.  Had another customer in car wash actually strike up conversation about how nice the car is.","Blue tooth with upload of contacts, and callout voice dialing of any number.  Oversized sunroof, Nevada leather seats, mp3 capability in cd system affords about 95 songs per cd.  I pod jack with charger right next to it.  Auto wipers and auto lights.  Sound system with basic stereo. Driving is fun!","Even better mileage, mp3s don't recognize artist nor song title even though recognized in other stereo systems, contacts appear alpha by first name instead of last, rear latch opener on key chain is too close and opens when trying to start car, iphone integration should not be extra."
4.375,What a blast,Scotty ,02/23/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"What an absolute blast this little SUV has been from day one, It still brings a smile to my face every time I get to climb behind the wheel.  It sticks to the road like glue, accelerates bullet like away from lights (or as bullet like as you'll get in an SUV) and it's very comfortable.  We bought Alpine White with sport package and loaded it up with options.  Be prepared for sticker shock - big time !","Exhilarating and fun to drive, like having an oversized go kart.  Great acceleration and awesome stopping power, sticks to the road like glue.   ","Nav system update is a must for BMW. Compared to the competition the BMW set up verges on being useless, we still haven't figured out how to use it properly.  Sticker shock hits hard, like every BMW, turning a base box into an ""ultimate driving machine"" is a very expensive proposition indeed"
2.625,Just Not Worth the Money,Marc ,12/08/2007,,,3,3,3,3,,2,3,2,2,"This is my 2nd X3 in 6 months.  I had so many problems with 2007 that BMW bought out my lease and I ordered another one (would not let me totally out of the lease).  These are overpriced and not up to par with Japanese vehicles.  Problems-- transmission does not mesh with engine, hesitation, brakes grab, OEM tires were AWFUL in snow last few weeks, took them off before slid into something.  Navigation system is archaic.  Radio even upgraded one just does not provide quality sound.  This is definitely not the ultimate driving machine.  I would never recommed an X3 to anyone else.  I do not know how other reviews are favorable.  Guess just taken away with BMW emblems all over the car.",BMW emblems ,Navigation. Engine/transmission that work together. Decent OEM tires that grip the road. Better sound systems. Make an alarm standard.  
4.875,Worth Every Penny,ericbell1 ,11/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,We've owned the car approximately one month and still brings a smile to our face while driving.  This is our first BMW and we're very pleased with the build quality and the fit/finish.,Absolutely love the handling.  The wife likes the bluetooth and heated steering wheel.,"Automatic transmission problems from '07 still remain in early production '08s. Will take it to the dealer for the supposed fix; however, this does not ruin our experience one bit."
4.875,What a wonderful SAV by BMW,BMW4Life ,11/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just got our 2008 X3 two weeks ago with all options except servotronic.  It's been wonderful so far.  We have the alpine white with sports performance package which comes with 19"" wheels.  This is a must have if you want the best looking X3 out there, it looks so much better than the rest.  The color coded aero kit makes this car look even better (no more black bumpers/moldings.  It drives like my 540 and it also has the cargo space to haul our weekend gears.  We have two kids and my wife can sit between the two car seats for our two our trip last weekend, and she's 5'8"", it is almost the same size as our 01 X5, but it is much quicker because it's 800 lbs lighter and it is also fuel efficient","Alpine white exterior, 19"" wheels, auto-headlights; panoramic moonroof, bluetooth; quick and smooth transmission.",it could use a better navigation system.
4.875,One great small SAV,BMW4Life ,11/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Got my 08 X3 two weeks ago, have all options except servotronic steering, sports performance package is a must, the 19"" wheels look so much better than the rest.  Alpine white exterior is the best color choice by far.  Automatic headlights is cool.  It drives like my 540, but with enough cargo to haul our weekend gears.  We have two kids and my wife can still sit in the middle between the two car-seats for a two hour drive.  It is almost the same size as my 01 X5, only quicker and more fuel efficient.","Color coded aerodynamic kit, 19"" wheels, smooth but quick acceleration (no hestitation noticed), automatic headlights, bluetooth, panoramic moonroof, good cargo space for a small SAV.",Navigation could be better
