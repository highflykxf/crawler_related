Highway mileage is 26-28 city it 17-22. Could be better but I knew what I was getting myself into. For the trim an leather seats an all the features an the low mileage an price I paid. Well worth the cost!! Had it over 8 months an not one problem. Had one recall on it an had dealership fix it free. Great car that's safe an very customizable.

I finally started to get a little warping of the front rotors at 160K, and went ahead and replaced all four rotors and installed new brake pads.

The car has been great so far and consistently gives 22 to 23 mpg on the highway runs visiting my kid at college. Great comfort, ride and performance to boot! And unique looks to go with it. The interior could stand to be upgraded a bit. You can see where Chrysler cut corners: But still very liveable inside and out.

However, I was directed to an 08 300C Hemi with the SRT design package. It has the standard Hemi, but it's own 20 inch rims, handling package, steering, exhaust and other features from the SRT8.

I have taken two long trips already and find the car very comfortable and economical.  I get around 18 around town and up to 28 on the highway.  The AWD is a must in Alaska.  Knowing that it has the E-class suspension and 4-matic transmission is very comforting.

Cream or light tan would add so much more class.  The total black dash with tortoise-shell accents is great, but the headliner should either match or be contrasted with something softer.  The two-toned dash looks off somehow.  Also, a body style like this craves darker colors, like maroon metal flake, to show off the lines.  Color selection is so limited. Right now, only black looks good enough to buy.  The dash could be more 3- dimensional, and not so flat, but the blue glow should stay.  You guys are close, though.",styling in certain colors,bland gray interior is boring.  try cream seats and headliner with black dash and console (with tortoise shell inserts) - you'll see what i mean.  now that's luxury.  make the egg-crate grill go away and make the mesh grill standard.

The Impala had more features, auto headlights, dual climate controls, flex fuel, remote start as standard. The 2.7 motor in the 300 is okay when cruising but it really works on hills.

So for around 20k, I get a stylish, luxurious head-turner, with Mercedes E Class underpinnings. Sure, everyone THINKS the car is way faster than it is. And maybe that's why the pros dig on the 2.7. It's just not worthy. But I LOVE this car. It saved me from boring large, boring sedanville. Definitely the coolest big boy sedan under 25K!","Sweet body styling, superb handling, impressive power - incredible bang for the buck. So far, there's nothing I don't like about this car.

The stereo sounds great and the sets are very top notch.  We traded in a Durango and this has more leg room in the rear then our SUV had. I am really pleased with my purchase and the 25 mpg makes me smile.",,
5,Superb Vehicle,Mark Robinson ,02/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have had this vehicle for a few months now and I could not be happier. Not only is it fun to drive but it always seems to draw attention. A lifetime powertrain warranty was icing on the cake for me. Will definitely purchase another Chrysler.,Satellite radio,
4.875,This one is a winner,Mike ,02/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just bought this vehicle after being a big Cadillac Seville fan.  I was looking for an AWD vehicle and looked at the Infiniti M and Lexus GS, finally drove this one and for about 12k less (based on my final cost) this was hands down the best buy.  Interior design and materials aren't Lexus or Infiniti but they are far better than any of the other vehicles I had looked at including the Cadillac.  Good ride, will go through anything (within reason), excellent entertainment system, great seats, and one of the few cars that you can get rear seat heaters in.  Back seat is comfortable and you actually have leg room.  Exceptionally quiet too.  The price after rebates and discounts was amazing.","Entertainment system, heated front and rear seats (lux pkg), power (gobs), and the ability to go about anywhere in any weather.  The fact that you can put a trailer hitch on this, as well.  The Dark Titanium is an excellent color addition.",Chrysler needs a little more attention to detail on the fit of the body panels.  My hood and passenger fender were a little skewed (didn't quite fit together with the other panels).  Something that can be adjusted but shouldn't have left the factory or dealer that way.
3.375,First Time Chrysler Owner - Mistake ??,Terry ,12/29/2007,,,4,5,1,1,,4,3,5,4,"The first six days of ownership were great and enjoyable.  Great ride and appearance.  Drove the Hemi and 3.5 V6..noticed a heavier fell with the Hemi..but mileage and price for 3.5 was great.  Just over a week of ownership, I needed to use the windshield washer and when I hit it, the electrical system died, killing the engine.  A immedate release of the windshield washer resulted in a immedate restart, but in a lower gear requiring me to pull off the road.  In heavy traffic and at high speed this event could have been a significant risk to us and those that might had been behind us.  Dealer has ordered parts yet concerned that circuit board damage was result vs cause.  Time will tell.",Love the appearance of this car and dash display.  The ride is a little light but steering is very responsive.  Mileage of 3.5 is better than the Camry I traded in..  Life time warranty was sweet..and possible needed in my case..  ,"Front seats could be a little softer..  Would like the additional power plug to be in the dash vs center console..or better yet, a third power outlet."
4.875,Oh what a ride,Dale ,11/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,What at great car love the interior and exterior. Handles like a dream great responce love to drive again.  Mileage for me is about 18 to 20 wife ranges 20 to 22 don't know why. Not bad for a hemi though. Acceleration is there when you need it the faster you go the nicer the ride.,"Power, comfort, styling",Mileage is about it 
5,Better than Old Lexus,THOMAS BEECHUM ,11/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I love my new SRT 8!  I have been an owner of a Lexus GS and an Infinity 4.5. They both are Yugo's compared to this. I love the power and fit and finish is great!.  Any stoplight drag race is mine from now on. I don't think I'll ever go back to imports,Power. Fit of panels. Great looking not boring like import brands,More color choices would be nice.  
4.625,Nice Wheels,Car Guy ,10/04/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"This is one great car. Extremely comfortable, powerful, fast (I see too many speeding tickets in my future), and it handles great as well. Excellent ride quality and responsive, if somewhat numb steering. Averaging over 20 MPG in mixed driving - and that's during the first 1,000 miles. Upgraded Boston Acoustics stereo is worth the money - makes the car a rolling sound studio. Exceptional build quality for an American car. I personally see no downside to the car, except possibly the gas mileage - but what do you expect from a 5.7L V-8?","Hemi V-8 power, stereo, infinitely adjustable power seats, rear seat warmers","The interior, while nice, could be a little more exciting."
5,My Rating of the Chrsyler 300,My Fine 300 Cruiser ,09/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought car then set off for North Carolina. Handled great on freeways. Gas consumption above anticipated level. Great car to drive. Recommend it highly. Wife likes it, too! Go Chrysler...keep 'em coming",Comfort and driving ease.,"Please add a ""trash"" receptacle to the vehicle....no one else has thought of this feature... It is sorely needed for travelers."
