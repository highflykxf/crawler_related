I always thought the LaCrosse was sharp, and the Super takes that a step further. Being black with the tasteful chrome trim, including the optional chrome wheels, it gets compliment after compliment. Wasnt sure how I felt about the dark brown interior but it has grown on me. Love the power and ride, but after only a couple of months of ownership, the transmission has had to be completely overhauled. Since its still under warranty, Im taking it in stride. Other than that I have been nothing but happy with it. ","Contrast of Black finish with chrome trim, door handles, grille, wheels and exhaust ports. Just about every option you could want. Good mix of classic and modern design on the interior and Cocoa interior makes for something different. Exhaust sounds great. Nice rumble without being overpowering and the 5.3 V8 will make you foget you're driving a so called ""old persons car"" .","Cant really improve on a model thats no longer being produced, but I wish GM would produce more models of this nature.

4.875,Luxurious,stockee ,03/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Very luxurious. From its smooth as butter ride, to its whisper quiet and powerful engine. Love the bench seat and useful column gearshift uses less space. Everything looks, feels, and sounds solid. From the solid slam of the door and feel of the column gearshift sliding through each gear. Love the midnight blue and soft beige leather","6 passenger seating, column gearshift, moonroof, stereo, quiet and butter smooth ride, and power and stability control",Longer lasting wipers and bigger washer fluid tank
4.875,Su-purr,zeke ,03/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car really purrs. Quiet inside with a strong exhaust note. Accelerate to 65 and slam the brakes. Great stopping time, no pulling left/right. gGas mileage? Who cares. Finally an American car that really looks like something people will buy. Watch the reaction from Acura TL and Altima owners.  That says it all.","The 18's rule. With black onyx finish, the ""gawk factor"" is off the charts for a mass produced vehicle. Bilsteins are great.","HID headlights, led tail lights, remote fuel door, more aggressive ground effects, rear drive, transmission shifter that's not ""plasticy"" and cheap. 13"" or 14"" discs front and rear by brembo"
4.375,Excellent Family Car,Dave ,02/24/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"We have about 2000 miles on it thus far. Our first Buick after years of only Japanese car purchases. We haven't been disappointed. The 2008 LaCrosse's redesigned front end reduces (or even eliminates) the ""grandparents' car"" look with a sleeker more attractive style. The comfort and convenience package is worth the price, which adds fold-down rear seats, heated front seats, and a few other amenities. Very nice. City mileage has averaged in the high teens or 20 mpg, and highway mileage in the 28-30 mpg range. The car rides smoother and quieter than any Camry/Altima we test drove, has great acceleration, and comes with many standard features you pay more for in the Japanese cars. ","Smooth and quiet ride, heated front seats, updated styling, decent gas mileage for a larger V6 car, more than adequate sound system, OnStar and XM radio.",Engine hood opening latch difficult to access and use. Very small glove box room compared to the large size of the glove box door...deceptive. Rear seat leg room is tight for tall people.
4.875,Luxury Car at a reasonable price,Kabe ,01/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"At 1400 Miles so far I can honestly say I love my New Lacrosse. The LaCrosse CXL is very much a luxury car. Soft comfortable interior, very quiet on the road, lots of features, and a fantastic ride. Buick has firmed up the suspension from the LeSabres and it is a wonderful balance between good control and a smooth ride. No more floaty Buicks. I have had passengers comment that it rides as well as their much more expensive Audi. The 3.8L V6 provides ample pickup but is still quiet, and it should last a long time by reputation. It is a very enjoyable car to drive and well worth checking out. This car is not typical Buick of the past.","Remote start, OnStar, XM radio, backup-system, on steering-wheel radio controls, heated seats/mirrors, very quiet and the wonderful ride.","Handle on the trunk would be nice. Also the remote could use some kind of feedback to tell if the car started when you can't see it. Also for some reason the seat backs are not power, but every other feature on the seat is. A little odd, but all minor issues. Overall wonderful!"
4.75,Great Car - Bad MPG,Allie ,01/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I love the car's handling and the ride.  It's sharp and when I step on the gas pedal it is powerful.  A car you can get into trouble with on the highway very easily.  Great for long trip!  However, as others have said, it doesn't live up to the posted MPG.  I get 5 miles less in the city and 2 miles less on Hwy.  A real gas hog.","Backup sensors, heated exterior side mirrors, sunroof, remote start, and heated seats.",Do something about the vent below the dash on the driver's side.  My left leg gets too much cold or hot air.  Had the same problem in my Pontiac GP.
3.5,Only 1600 miles and got problems,Louise Sabourin ,10/17/2007,,,4,4,4,3,,5,2,2,4,"My low oil level light came on and when I checked the oil it was only about a 1/4"" showing on the stick. Called the dealer and took it in and they said the 2008 seals were changed and that I needed to have them taken out and replaced because of the oil level dropping. So hopefully changing these seals will solve my problems and I can depend on it for years to come. ",I like all the features that it has as they are all comforting when you are usually a lone driver,The only thing that I would suggest is more comfortable front seats as I find there is not enough padding to make your back feel comfortable.
4.875,Buick LaCrosse Super ,Super LaCrosse ,09/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased my first Buick in December 2007. I chose a LaCrosse CXS. After owning a Olds Intrigue, I wanted to see what Buick had to offer. What a surprise. I loved my Lacrosse with the V-6. It had power, luxury and was so much better built than my Olds. I heard that Buick was going to build the Super, so I waited and bought the one off the showroom floor. I gave my CXS to my son,he loves it and he is 21. What a wonderful car!. Buick and GM have finally put together a complete package of power,luxury,value and overall satisfaction you will not regret. I find my Super to be smooth comfortable and fun to drive. I like it better than my Caddy STS.This is no old man car, I drive 140 miles a day.","Quiet, very smooth ride that is not mushy. Buy the V-8. Great power and sound. Bose system is outstanding. The seats are very well designed and comfortable. The auto start feature a must! Interior is a home run!",I wish the steering wheel controls had the OnStar mounted on it. Chrome wheels should be standard. 
5,2008 LaCrosse Super,Jack ,09/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I'm told I was the first '08 LaCrosse Super owner in the state of Illinois. I couldn't be prouder of my new car. I think it should be considered a ""baby boomers"" dream car because of its powerful V-8 engine, luxurious leather seating, and all the bells and whistles you would ever want.","Its great V-8 engine, nice exhaust note, very comfortable leather seats, XM radio, OnStar, and interior trim","None that I can think of. Since we live in the snow belt, I wouldn't buy a car without FWD, and my LaX has it."
5,Baby Boomer's dream car,Jack ,08/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was fortunate to be able to get the third Lax Super made at GM's highly acclaimed Oshawa assembly plant. So far, no problems to report. The car's acceleration, exhaust note, and seating comfort are great. It came fully loaded, except for the sunroof.","5.3 liter engine and its great exhaust note, and its ""Dreamweave"" seats.",Nothing comes to mind.
