5,Love it so far,Tyler Turner ,06/16/2016,5,5,5,,,5,4,4,5,,,"I bought the 08 Tiburon GT Limited with 39,600 miles on it. Haven't been driving it for too long but i am loving it, it's definitely way better than the 99 Saturn SL i had before i got my Tiburon. All the reviews i read say it's a pile of junk, clutch goes out, weak engine, etc. I can agree that the engine isn't as powerful for a V6, however i didn't buy this car for racing, i bought it for everyday commuting that has a bit more power than the average car. I can see myself putting some more horses under the hood in the near future. I like the red leather seats, it adds a little more flare to the cars already good looks. Only issues i have is that the previous owner put quite a few scratches on it as well as the American Racing alloy wheels they added to, the sunglasses holder falls down a lot, and the amount space to see next to you and behind you are minimal...but i am used to it now, and like i said before the engine could use some more power. If you're looking for something that's faster than buy another car, don't complain about something you should've done some research on.",,

I will never buy a Hyundai again and make sure to spread the word to everyone I know of this time consuming ordeal and financial strain I had to go through.


Buyer Beware: the 10-year warranty does no good when you have to spend over $1,000 on repairs every 2 years because of a problem Hyundai has not addressed and is not taking responsibility to notify their customers and dealers to have remedy."

3.625,"fun, unreliable and costly",robbie ,02/10/2009,,,4,5,4,2,,2,5,2,5,"If you are going to buy a Tib stay away from the standard shift or you will regret it. My car has had to go in four times since I bought it. Twice for the clutch, once for a flywheel, and once for a snapped cable. The clutch will cost over a $1000 off warranty. I've been told privately by at least two different Hyndai mechanics that they are always replacing the clutches which are crap. The car is red, but it should be lemon yellow.","Comfortable ride, nice exterior styling.","More power, better mileage, more interior head room. Some medchanical reliability would be nice."
4.625,Excitment on the Road,Tom ,01/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,This is a great looking car and for me a great time to buy.  With Owner Loyalty and rebates this car is a great bargain.  I purchased for a 17 year old driver but I find myself borrowing the car every chance I get.  ,"I love the dual exhaust and the Kenwood stereo with REMOTE.  The seats are very comfortable on my 6'2"" frame and I weigh in at 220.",There is a bit of a blind spot and I wish the gas mileage was better...
4.875,Fun first coupe owned,Bokyung ,12/28/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"At first, I was attracted to the more powerful Civic Si, Scion tC, and the GTi from VW. The GTi and Si not being in my price range, I had to choose between the tC or Tiburon, which was very easy. The Tiburon GS is a great little coupe that looks a LOT better then most coupes in its price range. The Tiburon has a decent acceleration, and decent high-speed max. Handling is very good, and this car is also a good platform for the modding enthusiasts. The car is small, so its easy to maintain the exterior and interior.","The redesign of the headlights makes the new Tiburon look menacing, and the overall shape of the car goes with the headlights a lot better. The headlamps is projector lens, so you can install HID lighting. Chromed, dual exhausts looks sick, and makes a good sound, although a bit quiet.","The stock engine lacks in power. Most 2.0 engines in general come with 150+ hp/tq or comes with turbo. The turn radius seems lacking, and the steering seems a little bit numb. The interior could use more color then black, although the dash lights kinda makes up for it."
4.875,great car for the money,ed ,11/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,You're not going to get the styling & features for the money in any other car. My main complaint is I could use a little more headroom. The sun roof takes away some of the headroom. I'm used to driving cars in this price range & I have to say this is the sportiest car I've had in a long time. Gas mileage could be better. I don't think I get the mileage advertised. Seems like I don't get very far on a tank of gas. ,,more head room with the sun roof. Longer travel distance on a tank of gas. Some people like the sound of the engine. I would prefer a quieter ride.
4.75,Fun in spa city,mario ,11/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,This car is fun to drive. Everybody that rides in it wants one. After driving pick ups for the last 10 years this car made driving a lot more fun. Both my college age kids want me to loan it out to them. I looked at a lot of other cars and the price a warranty changed my mind.,"Interior, rims with 17`s,comfort, and gas mileage","more power with engine, wider tires"
4.625,A lot of fun in a little package,Ted ,10/14/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,5,5,"When I first saw this car, I knew I had to have one. So I test drove and bought my Tiburon about a month ago. After driving a Jeep for two years and an Explorer for five years before that, I was ready to get back into a fun car. The Tiburon is just that - fun. Very smooth ride and decent acceleration for a 4 cylinder, though when the a/c is on, the power cut is noticeable. The five-speed transmission is a little stiff. Also, that blind spot took a little getting used to. And don't expect to give rides to anybody over about 5'-10"", especially in the back seat. Face it, this is not a family car. However, it is a lot of fun for the buck. Oh, and despite fuel ratings, I average 25 city/34 hwy.","Sleek styling, punchiness, sheer amount of fun to drive, sunroof, five speed. Big enough trunk room for my guitar, amp, gigbag, and pedalboard. Tight steering. Decent acceleration for such a small engine except when the a/c is on.","Despite being 5'-6"", it's still not easy to get in or out of. always dragging my feet on the door, getting the interior panels dirty. I'd like to see a slightly longer wheelbase. Add 25 hp to the 4-cyl. engine. Remove the ability of the passenger door lock to open both doors. shark gill side trim"
2,The Worst Sports Car Out There,Matthew ,09/28/2008,,,1,2,2,2,,3,1,3,2,"Let's start with the advantages: its pricing, its fuel economy, and its lack of show-offyness. Pricing is very good for the Hyundai Tiburon GT limited edition, at just $17,000. Actually I sometimes think that it's a good buy. It's not a ""fast car"", but it's great for backroad bombing it works pretty well on the highway. Driving isn't considered fun, however. On the other hand, fuel economy is ok at 22mpg in the city and 28mpg on the highway. The car gets to 60mph in 8.0 seconds, which isn't impressive these days, but better than some cars of this Tiburon's price range. It's an acceptable car for its price range, and not too show-offy either, but Hyundai needs some improvements to the Tiburon","AM/FM radio with CD player, keyless entry, cruise control, steering wheel with radio controls, lack of show- offyness, pricing","Performance (Hyundai's sports car should aim for a 0 to 60 time of about 5 to 5.5 seconds rather than 6.5 in their GT), luxury (this car just has your necessities, like radio and heat and ventilation, but don't expect fancy stuff unless you pay extra for it), exterior looks"
4.625,Great car for a great price,clayt88 ,09/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"This is a great little car that my wife and I just bought after finishing college. We're very pleased, overall, with its performance. We've had Civics and Mustangs in the past and this Tiburon rates right up there. It doesn't handle nearly as well as a Civic Si, but it handles better (and is more fun to drive) than a Mustang.","The car is beautiful inside and out; I'm particularly impressed with the classically-styled gauges (with ""modern"" blue interior lights) and the impressive cargo room that neither Civic or Mustang can come close to. The Kenwood stereo is really cool and Tiburons are an absolute blast to drive!","Frankly, the ""keyless entry"" remote sucks and barely works right even though it's brand spanking new. And the front seats are too high and not very sporty, even when completely ""down."" The windows are too shallow. But that's minor stuff and I'm just picking nits here."
5,A fun ride!,JLR ,09/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I've had this vehicle two weeks and I absolutely love it! It's a sports car without the sports car price. The I4 and 5 speed manual trans gets me going down the road very smartly and gets great gas mileage. I notice that people come up beside me on the freeway to take a double look to see what it is I'm driving. It's a real fun ride and I'd highly recommend it!!,"Interior layout, dual exhaust (I've put on a pair of Magnaflow 1226's). The sleek design is a head-turner. The blue interior lighting at night is very pleasing to the eye.","Although the I4 is zippy it would be nice to have a turbo option. The stereo, although good, could use a bit more bottom-end bass."
4.75,I'm Glad I did,Katie ,08/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I've now put 3500 miles on my Tiburon. We seem to be getting used to one another. So far I am very happy with my sporty little ride. I get compliments often and lookers regularly. I am really enjoying it and it's overall performance it plenty for me. Never thought I would want a sports [or in this case just sporty] car, but I'm glad I did.  I've read reviews containing comments about the lack of leg room in the back seat. Come on, does anyone expect back seat leg room in a sports car. ","Front exterior, really cute headlights. Awesome exterior contouring. ","A bit more head room, my big/tall friends don't fit real well. A little more power would be good too."
4.75,I LOVE this car,Caroline ,08/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I have only owned this vehicle for a short time, but I already love it. I love the exterior and interior design and the price tag was great too! It is sporty, and practical compared to some other sports cars, especially with gas prices being at 4.14 per gallon where I live. When most people first look at this car, it takes them a while to realize that it is a hyundai tiburon. In my opinion, it somewhat resembles a Maserati GranTurismo. Compared to my friends 2008 honda civic si coupe, this car is more solidly built and more pleasing to the eye inside and out. Overall, I love this car and would definitely recommend it!!!","Interior, dual exhaust, wheels(or as some people call them, rims) side mirrors, i love the front end of this car and side detailing. I like the partial leather seats because leather wears so fast, it looks sporty too.","The back end isn't my favorite feature. A little more leg room in backseat and more head room all over. I stand at 5,3"" this car is very comfortable, but for my 6,4"" father, it was just too small, and lets face it, if you are a heavier set person the sport seats may be uncomfortable."
4.375,"Affordable, Fun, & Smooth",CW ,08/06/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,4,4,"The Tiburon GT, at minimum, is adequate in every area.  It's ride is smooth and nimble. The experts claim that the handling is ""numb"", but I have found it to be the best handling car that I have ever driven.(That includes Acura TL, Acura CL, Honda Civic, Ford Taurus SHO, and Ford Mustang) The brakes are extremely responsive and took some getting use to. The engine is a little weak, considering it is a V6 with 172 HP, but it will give enough pep for realistic driving. I have been extremely pleased with the gas mileage. Critics, and Hyundai themselves have posted 17/23 MPG, while I have been consistently getting 25-27 MPG when driving conservative. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase. ","I find the automatic climate control easy to use and equally effective. The cruise control is uniquely designed and easy to operate. The instrument panel is simple, yet very cool. The GT model comes with 17"" alloy wheels that are really pleasing to the eye. Overall, the exterior design is superb!","The GT comes with a Kenwood CD player that includes XM. However, I have trouble with XM satellite reception due to the fact that there is no exterior antenna. Trees pose a reception problem. I have found the 4 speed automatic transmission to be a little lackluster. It could use a 5th gear. "

5,What a sweet ride~~~,Sean ,04/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"When Hyundai redesigned the Tiburon, I had to get it.  It looks so stylish.  I love the freshly designed front and rear.  The 17in RIM is also very nice.  With blue interior lights, car looks great at night too.  Performance is pretty good too, although it can be improved.  I'm sure the new Genesis coupe will be excellent in terms of performance.  Best of all, Tiburon is real fun to drive.",Exterior and Interior style,Little more performance.

This car is really fun to drive, looks amazing inside and out, and has pretty much every feature you could want in a car.  I love the Kenwood head unit.  At night the car is beautifully lit up on the inside.  I can't wait until my first long trip this summer to see how the highway gas mileage is.  The car is a 4 cylinder but to me, its not that noticeable.  A side note, this car comes with the ""tiptronic steering"" where you can somewhat experience driving a manual.  I would recommend not using this feature...I have in the past in other vehicles and had to replace the transmission.",Definitely the interior styling.  Mine is black exterior with black interior and it looks amazing.  Also I really love to drive this bad boy.,Back seat has no legroom/headroom for an adult.

Everything about this car is awesome...and you can't beat Hyundai's warranty either. I was looking for a cute *sportsy* car that was good on gas AND insurance...this fit the bill.

4.125,Tiburon Exceeded Expectations,David Westwood ,04/01/08 22:51 PM (PDT),4,4,3,5,4,5,4,4," From the moment I test drove this vehicle, I was pleasantly surprised with how sporty and fun it is to drive. It has plenty of pep in the motor and the handling is nimble enough to qualify as a legitimate sport coupe. For the price and performance, I think the Tiburon is a diamond in the rough. ","The sound system is good, but not great. Also, the instrument/dash setup is unique and pleasing to the eye. Overall, the interior is nicely done, and leaves you with a satisfied feeling. This car is simply fun!","For a sporty car, I found that the braking is only adequate. The exhaust noise is somewhat loud, but I like a car with a little roar. "

I have had to replace the clutch on my 2008 Tiburon 2 times already and it has come out of my pocket.  Hyundai says the clutch is a normal wear and tear item and is not covered under warranty.  My alternator went bad a month ago and hyundai took care of everything.  If you buy this car get an Automatic or you will be kicking yourself later.
