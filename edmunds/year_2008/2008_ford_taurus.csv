5,Great Cruiser,Mark Bu ,03/29/2016,5,3,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,"The Taurus line is know to be reliable and safe.  I purchased this 2008 Ford Taurus (SEL) 3.5 Lt to offer long term reliability while getting a low purchase price.  Car at 67,000 miles (less than 1 month of purchase) does NOT have a working A/C system.  Currently at dealer I purchased hoping they can find the source of leak. I purchased lower profile and wider tires as it felt boaty and a slight rock back and forth.  Changing the tires to top of the line - Continental Grand Touring Pure-Contact tires made a hugh difference in feeling solid and no sway feel.  After driving it around for one month, I would have to say this would be a great cruising car on the highways.  It is very solid, sound proof and is so comfortable inside.  However, to be used around town or to zip in and out of traffic, this car is NOT.  Mileage is not very good in my book but for a 2008 it actually is good if that makes sense.  If used on the highway, I am sure is would get 25-26 miles per gallon.  True round the town is probably in the 20 mpg range.One thing I did notice about this car was the extensive rusting of the cars frame.  I believe I read about this before buying this car.  I placed it on the dealers lift before buying and would have to say it is the worst rusting of any under belly of any car I have ever seen.  Car was a one owner in the hills of PA.  I will purchase  spray cans of a very expensive product sold buy Eastwood to slow or stop the rusting process.Again, I would purchase this car if you don't have to drive much and if you did, it should be a highway vehicle to get the most out of your money.",,

My son had the car for 3 years with no trouble at all and he wanted a new mustang so I bought this from him and I love the car. It gets great gas mileage and handles very well in all climates. the acceleration is right up there with my 90 corvette and I must say I am very impressed with the car. Ford has done these engines right and now im thinking of looking into some ford vehicles( just looking cause im a chevy guy). overall the Taurus has performed better than I ever imagined and I wish I had bought it earlier but it was a good car for my son and served him well. Its a 2008 with 81k miles and I feel it will be in the family for a long time. If you are looking for a great family car or just want a reliable ride then this is it, you wont be disappointed.",,

The car performed flawlessly, smooth shifting, took mountains like they weren't even there.   If you are looking for that big car feel  GET ONE.   Had a tough winter here in Wisconsin and the Taurus did great.  It went thru snow and ice very well,  the traction control kept me feeling very safe.  We have  almost 146000 now and still running  great.",,
5,I call it the Lincoln Light,Charles J. Cates ,08/31/2015,,5,5,,,5,5,4,5,,,"This is a large heavy sedan, more like a Crown Victoria than the â€‹previous generation Taurus. It has surprisingly good acceleration ""out of the hole"" and merging onto the interstate is no problem for the naturally aspirated 3.5 Liter V-6. When you park the car or pull it into the garage is when you realize this is a full size car. OK,  it IS shorter than my '63 BelAir. It is quiet with little NVH. The stereo system in the limited sounds better than the system in my ""man cave"". The transmission shifts smoothly and seamlessly. I did notice a lack of power pulling some steep grades on U.S. 22 where we live in west central PA. The car was frequently downshifting for more power. The climate control system is easy to set and works well. The leather upholstery is attractive and wears well. The vinyl dash and trim is soft and does not have a hard plastic feel. The size of the display in the dash for miles, mpg, miles to empty, oil life etc. are a little too small for my liking or perhaps I'm showing my age. I'll be interested to see how this car performs in the winter time with front wheel drive and new Falken brand all season Touring radials. Though we have only owned this car for a few months we have been impressed with it. The only real gripe I have with the car is that  there seems to be a corrosion problem on the alloy wheels that I can't seem to get off with anything that I have tried. Since I posted this review originally, we have driven it for over a year. Last winter the car performed well for most of the winter in the Falken All Season Radials but a couple deep snows convinced me to go with a dedicated Snow tire this winter. ( Falken Eurowinter) . I replaced the alloy wheels with a black  aftermarket wheel which draws lots of compliments , retaining the corroded OE wheels for the dedicated snow tires. The Taurus has performed well, with no mechanical issues thus far. It has given 24 MPG on the highway doing 65 to 70 mph on the highways. Around town it gets 15 to 19 MPG.",,

The only thing I've had to do (besides scheduled maintenance) is ....now that I think about it, I haven't done anything besides the usual stuff! Its been a wonderful car and I love it. 

Whenever my friends get inside my car, they are shocked that they are in a TAURUS. Even though the thing is 6 years old, it still has a modern design. ","Buttons. Buttons are hard to find in a car these days. Everything is unresponsive touch screens. 

The car itself is super comfy, but handles better than you'd expect.

The sound system on the Limited puts out amazing sound, much better than my brothers Lexus IS350.

The 6 cylinder engine provides plenty of pick up on the highway","The grill is essentially foil over plastic and can peel off, especially in harsh climates. The heated seats are TOO effective, and they burn out. Not a deal breaker though.

One thing led to another and I dug this Taurus sitting on the lot. It was a handsome design and, honest to God, I didn't even know they still made Taurus'. I did some homework and bought the car a few days later with just over 80k on the engine.It's been over a year since then I've put nearly 40k on the engine in the last 15 months. The Taurus has been through its paces, that's fer sure. And at this point I think I can give it a half decent review.Pros: It's been totally reliable. I've recorded 26 mpg with the AC running. And it looks real nice washed up.Cons: It's abundantly dull to drive.","I love how much room the Taurus has. I'm never embarrassed to ask adults to sit in the large back seats. The trunk is massive, so large that I don't clean it nearly as often as I should. And, as I said before, it looks great even after five years on the market. Apparently it's also really safe though I've luckily not had to test that feature. It has some power if you ask it to but it doesn't seem to like it much. It's much happier to cruise and rides like a champ.",I'm short and the seats on long drives can get uncomfortable.

We bought this car with 50,000 miles on it. It rode and handled great then. After replacing the tires with a much better tire the ride quality and noise level both became significantly better. Now with 130,000 miles on it she still runs like new. The only repair transmission oil cooler at 80,000 miles. The drivers side heated seat went out ( normal ) and haven't bothered to fix. ",The room is outstanding! The four of us can comfortably ride in any seat without feeling cramped. The back seat has more room than the front. Our 14 yr old is 6'2 and rides in comfort in the back. The engine has plenty of power. It has no trouble keeping up with traffic in TX with 80 & 85 mph speed limits. The truck has more room than many mid-size SUV's.,The sync function could be easier to utilize. I would like to see better fuel mileage. We get a combined 24.5.

The Taurus has a lot more room in the cabin, a much bigger trunk and AWD. The AWD makes a world of difference: in rain and snow the Lincoln LS was a death trap. Unfortunately the finishing of the trim of the Taurus is not up the Lincoln standard but I guess that is to be expected. I was able to install factory navigation myself so that was a nice bonus. I also bought the Taurus really cheap so I got a lot of value for money (definitely an under appreciated car)","Cabin space, trunk space, integration of steering wheel and audio, AWD, height of the driver seat (you see more further ahead).","Trim finishing should have been more professional, the gear box does not always shift as smooth as it should be (known issues)."

Seats are firm but comfortable, and power passenger seat a nice standard feature. My 6-4 son is comfortable in the back seat. Brakes great and plenty of power in the engine, worth the gas mileage trade off from my Camry. Although the 2010 has a sexier exterior, the wife and I both prefered the more open cabin in this model.

Overall, I have been extremely pleased with the car -- absolutely no problems.  I have a couple of previous Tauruses, most recently an '06 SEL and there is no comparison to the current version.  The older cars were OK, but they were basically appliances to get you from point A to point B.

MPG for me are 24 mixed city/highway, hoping for 30+ on the highway. ","I love the 6-CD audio system, the cream-colored leather seats (that was a must for me), and the higher- positioned seat.","I would like to see more leg room, widthwise, on the driver's side. It's too much like a mummy-shaped sleeping bag down at the foot pedals; it narrows too much. Make it wider in that area.  In addition, the steering wheel is a little too far away with the seat back for me because of my height."

Highway mileage is best at 60- upper 20's, city is not great, but this is a 2 ton plus car (4075 with AWD loaded -C&D article) with 263 horsepower, larger than any Toyota or Honda by 400-500 pounds with AWD, so gas mileage for its size is commendable. It is not a Corrola or camry 4 cylinder, and honda and Toyota V6 cars, including the Avalon, are much smaller regardless of class (400-500 pounds), and they do not offer AWD. Taurus feels more stable at fast highway speed, especially with cross winds than other sedans.","Comfort, outstanding reliability, value, Sync, easy to use, visibility is best of any sedan, safety, acceleration for its heft.

I like the look of the 2010 Taurus, but I am disappointed that the beltline looks like a 300, so visibility is taking a big hit, and the rear seat looses 3 inched of leg room. "

We were unable to find any other sedan with enough leg room that even average adults can ride in the back seat for extended trips. They all seem to have yielded this market to mini-vans, which I don't car for.  Can't figure out lack of automatic headlight switch.  Even our $10,000 cheaper Chevy Cobalt had that!  Now we are out of the habit of turning on lights at dusk and catch ourselves driving with them off at unsafe times. Nature's ugliest shade of brown on dash.","Rear leg room!

This is a large car, and for the class, the ride and handling are better than expected. It is no barn burner, but acceleration is very good, and the ride is very good. The car is comfortable, quiet and rides well. I almost bought the Avaolon, but I wanted AWD and back up sensors in a large car. The saftey factor and visibility, and the fact that the ride and quietness rival the Avalon won me over. The car has been cheap to own, and trouble free.

The Limited series has a quality feel to the interior and the tech system is impressive, especially with the nav and synch. The exterior styling is less impressive, but I was after more space and the car delivers that well. Gas mileage is tricky. I was actually getting better mileage with my GT in town. On the highway I notice that if I drive steady at 70 mph I get about 22.5 mpg; cruising at 65 I get about 24.5; and at 62 (tried today) I get about 26 mpg.

My mileage has improved significantly since my first road trip in January. In June my round trip mileage from an identical 2000 mile route improved over 4mpg to almost 31.  The difference could be due to winter vs. summer conditions, and break in. My car was new during the first trip. Now I am happy to report that highway fuel economy is excellent.

Handling is secure, and the ride is very smooth without being floaty. Brakes respond nicely, without much extra pedal travel. Sync is a pleasure. Seats are broad and supportive, but lack much side bolstering. Makes for easy entry/exit but doesn't hold you tight in corners. The leather is soft and perforated.

4.75,Best Value Sport/Luxury Sedan,tommygunn ,04/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,My last two vehicles have been an Infinity M-45 and a Lexus GS-400. I would rate my Taurus right there with these two vehicles for much less money. I admit I drive my vehicles very hard and my Taurus is up for the task. Highway cruising at 75mph plus is a dream with a smooth comfortable ride and enough power to easily overtake slower vehicles when passing. The handling in city traffic is surprisingly good. I prefer a performance/luxury car and my Taurus fits the bill.    ,Great gas mileage and a lot of car for the money.,I would like to see dual exhaust on the vehicle.
5,Finally an American car steps up!,valleycars1 ,04/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"What a score for Ford! The fuel economy and safety are great, but what really sold me was the interior space. I am a 6'8"" 300 pound man, and this car gives me room to spare.

On the interstate, cruise control set to 70 mph an awesome 31.5 MPG! A 20 gallon tank give me 400+ range. The power of this car is very nice, great acceleration, it's quiet with a very nice sound system. Hard to pass this car up, hands down beats the Accord and Buicks in overall comfort and economy..

I bought the Taurus SEL FWD, which is almost 200 lbs lighter than the Limited AWD. The Taurus 3.5L V6 engine with its 263 HP is as fast as my old 2004 Marauder with its V8 and 302 HP, but with 18/28 MPG! Its also just like a baby Lincoln. Probably the best sedan for the money around, considering its roominess, performance, handling, ride quality, quietness, and its build quality. I suffer from partial paralysis in my legs, so I need a car that I can get in&out of more easilty. The new Ford Command Seating allows me easy ingress/egress. I feel like a normal person again when I drive our new Taurus SEL!   ","Performance. Ride quality and handling. Roominess. Gas mileage.

4.875,Best car I have ever owned,captnmorgan ,03/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I looked around for about 2 weeks before I found this car. I had been looking at the Mercury Milan or a Fusion before I drove the 500 and decided to test drive a Taurus. I can say this is the best car I have ever driven. The overall quality is well above it's price. Most of my co- workers drive BMW and Mercedes and would rather have my car after looking at it.,"Sat radio and moving pedals.

5,What a Bargain,fredco ,02/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just bought a 08 Ford Taurus last week and can't believe what you get for the money. Since 1998, I had five Cadillac Devilles and two Eldorados. When I drive the Taurus, I don't see much difference between it and the Devilles that I've had.  I suppose there may be a little more road noise in the Taurus, but not much.  I've been resetting my mileage gauge when I go from city to highway or highway to city driving to see how the mileage looks.  So far, it appears that I'm getting about 17 city and 28 highway which is great for a car that is this big, comfortable and safe. I'm quite pleased with this purchase.","With stability control, this is a very safe, solid car. The build quality and fit and finish appear to be top notch. Based on my impressions, I don't understand why the highways aren't full of 08 Tauruses.","The console cover needs padding. It is very uncomfortable to rest your elbow on the console while steering with your right hand.  I had a trim shop pad the top of the console and it made a huge difference in comfort. Also, telescopic steering would be a welcome addition to this car."
4.75,Nice car!,starr ,02/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I looked at Lexus and MBZ before taking a look at the Taurus Limited. I was impressed with its safety rating.

5,Great American Car,JoAnne Harrell ,01/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Tried other cars foreign and domestic, but came back to the Ford.  I am a golfer so trunk space was very important.  The interior design and comfort are impressive.  Getting use to the SYNC with hands free dialing--not available on foreign cars yet.  Came with serius radio.  Drive and ride are very quiet and comfortable.  Previously had a Camry and 300M.  This car is already a  more impressive car. Should be a fierce competitor.

4.375,"Happy with the car, but with exceptions",Sweetwaterguy ,01/19/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"I replaced my 98 Avalon with the 08 Taurus.  It is as quiet as the Avalon, has more interior room, and comfortable- -even for a 6'5"" guy.  Fuel economy is very important to me, and I am very disappointed.  A recent drive, Wyoming to Iowa and back netted only 25.5 mpg hand calculated.  I would consistently get 30 on the old Avalon doing the same route.  It missed the EPA estimate by 2.5 mpg, and I drove conservatively as I typically do. Also, I find the heater, a/c, and fan controls on the lower dashboard are small and difficult to locate and adjust when driving. I would give a strong recommendation for the Taurus, but my disappointing gas mileage might make it a deal killer. ","Interior room, quiet, a trunk large enough to host a party, and overall fit and finish.  The transmission shifts smoothly and accurately.","Simplify and enlarge dashboard controls. Dashboard is too busy and making adjustments while driving may create safety issues, particularly with senior drivers."
5,Value Value!,brucelinc ,01/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Taurus is a screaming value.  It simply rides and drives more ""expensive"" than it is.  In addition, the level of standard equipment is impressive, considering the price.  The 3.5 and 6 speed automatic work beautifully together.  It is much smoother, more refined, quieter, and more powerful than the old Ford Five hundred.","Smooth, quiet ride, engine performance and smoothness, solidness of the body, build quality.","A telescoping steering wheel would be a worthwhile improvement.  Also, I would prefer the ability to manually control the transmission.  "
4,Great Car.,Midwest Dude ,12/19/2007,,,5,3,5,5,,3,5,3,3,"I've put about 4,000 miles on since October. My first Ford and very impressed with the combination of space and mileage.  Very quiet car on the road.  We're able to stick 3 car seats in back which is very important for this young family.  I've been driving on snow and ice recently and it feels very secure in those conditions.  The ergonomics of the car are quite nice.  My only complaint is I wish it had a telescoping steering wheel.  Lots of soft surfaces inside. The auto climate control has been the surprise feature for me.  It works great and the fans are really pretty quiet.  You set it to a temperature you like and never have to worry about messing with controls again.

We took it on its first road trip this week and it drives and handles great with an average of 22 mpg highway and in the city 17 mpg.  I am very impressed with the overall fit and finish and the back seat has the leg room that can realy fit real adults.  Excellent driving car with superior a safety rating.

5,Our 2nd Taurus,Dan Willis ,12/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I wouldn't have thought I'd buy another Taurus. Our kids are gone and we was thinking sports car. Go figure, my wife saw the new Taurus and was in love. The new engine transmission combination is a dream.  Interior comfort and style are all a person could ask for. We wanted to get a black exterior but didn't like the way the black stiching showed up on the gray leather. We went with the white exterior with the tan leather.  Turns out to be a great combination.  We've had the car four months now and couldn't be happier.  Havn't taken a long trip yet so can't comment on milage. City MPG seems to be around 18.  Only complaint is my wife won't let me drive the car.",Interior room and comfort. Exterior styling. I like the clean lines. Heated seats.,Would of liked Sync. Is there an after market version.

We started to look at several flat towable cars. We found out the new Taurus was flat towable. We have driven Crown Vic's prior to our last car, so we really had to be pleased. After the test drive, we were convinced this was a great car. After 3 weeks and 1500 miles, we still think this was a great choice. Rides great, handles great and the power is great. Must watch the speed. My combined mileage is 22 to 23 mpg. Highway driving at 65mph in Florida results in 30 to 31 mpg. A great choice for anyone.

5,Ford's big come back Car,vloh ,11/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The big 4 never came close to the imports until now.  Ford has outclassed all of the foreign cars that I've driven. Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, BMW 3 and 4 series, none of them come close to delivering what the Taurus has:  Good value, unsurpassed quality, performance, comfort and beauty.  I'm surprised to say that I'm a proud owner of a 2008 Ford Taurus.  For this past 20 years, I've only driven the Taurus cars when I had to rent them or when I was required to drive one for the Army.  I wasn't impressed with it before. I am now.  It's the best car that I have ever owned. I can see having this car for this next 5 years or more. Good job Ford.

3.875,Taurus is nice but rather bland,Rome Man ,10/03/2007,,,4,2,4,5,,4,4,4,4,"Bought this as a replacement for a 2005 500 SE with the CVT transmission. The new engine and transmission is better than the old 3.0/CVT setup for everyday driving and the ride is softer and quieter too. I like the interior better with richer looking woodgrains and improved fit and finish. The exterior is where my disappointment lies. This is where I like the 500 better. The rear end of the 08 Taurus looks plainer than the 500. The 500 also had body side moldings which help protect the sides of the car and broke up the tallness and plainess. Seems like this is happening on many new cars, a way for the manufacturers to cheapen the car and save money perhaps. Also a glovebox light would be nice",Room and comfort are top notch. Trunk pace is huge. New engine is a noticeable improvement over old 3.0 liter and the 6 speed automatic is more agreeable than the CVT. A lot of equipment for the money.,"Body side moldings should be an option. Glovebox needs a light, steering needs more feedback and make the springs firmer like the 500. A telescoping wheel would also be nice."

It is a cross between a Ford 500 and a Volvo. This car will holds its own with anything built in Europe or Japan. Has the ride of a Lexus, the handling of a small car, and the horsepower of an Audi.

It's beautiful to look at, angular but not like a CTS, rounded but nothing like the old one. It has 'presence' and attracts looks, something other than the 1986 Taurus couldn't do. A VAST improvement over my last Ford, a Mercury Mistake, err, Mystique with the disappearing transmission. Well done Ford!","Style, incredible rear seat space, better than a Rolls Royce! Trunk is a cavern, you could put an SUV to shame! Ride height, like a small SUV. AWD is a bonus. ALL buttons do light up at night, amazing!

It shift just where it ought to shift and still provides an avg 24mpg on the big 6-cyl motor (Highway I'm showing 28mpg!).   Radio sounds nice and is easy to operate.  Sunroof is well-designed with pop-up to reduce wind noise.   I'm two weeks into this car and am very impressed.

From acceleration, to handling, to quietness, the Taurus is much improved over the Five Hundred.  The attention to detail in the interior cabin design was greatly enhanced, the seats are still the most comfortable we have found in this class car, and in at least a dozen other ways, great and small, the car is an improvement over the Five Hundred basic concept.

It has the most back seat room and the largest trunk I have ever seen in a six-cylinder car, no contest!  The new Taurus is heavier than the 2007 Five Hundred which gives it a smoother ride, but the Five Hundred was a little more nimble. Take it on the highway where it belongs! 3.5L engine is a significant improvement over the Five Hundred but acceleration has only been upgraded to adequate.  Rather quiet cabin, turn on the radio and hear almost nothing outside! Glides over bumps in the road. The high seating position is great, and the (front) seats give good support for your back. Very comfortable inside.","Truck space and rear seat room, plus the smooth ride and very quiet cabin.","Acceleration could still be improved. Taking the on-ramp onto a busy highway requires you to floor the gas pedal to get on. The view through the rearview windshield is vertically narrow, but the large side-view windows compensate for this."
4.875,A Quantum Leap Forward,PJ ,06/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a great car. The engine and transmission are enough to make it a quantum leap over the 500 that it replaced, but the interior refinements, cabin quiet, and overall feel are as impressive.
