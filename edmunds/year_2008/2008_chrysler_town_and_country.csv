The dealer fixes it to have it not work for the next 2 summers. This was only the beginning. We've had numerous brake replacements, ball bearings replaced, ignition replacement, cracked radiator (new one), air conditioner hose replaced twice, a brand new transmission, remote window locks broken, complete realignment of drive shaft. These are only the ones we can remember. I have two friends with the same car. They have the exact same problems. This car was a money pit with cheaply made parts.",,

After purchasing it we put new yokahama tires H rated for that little extra security, all four brakes ,brake hoses , replaced plugs flushed coolant changed all wiper blades fixed the typical heater hose issue behind the exhaust manifold replaced the rear blower motor and changed the air filter as well as run nothing but Mobil 1 5w 20... I did this trying to start off with the van somewhat reliable so far I notice slight oil usage but considering the miles I'm not complaining it could be seeping from the rear main seal but not enough to make spots on the driveway. I bought an egr valve bc I heard that's a common failure but over all I think if you do good maintenance and replace parts as needed these vans can be great machines for a family. They are roolol affordable and just handy. We plan on dropping another engine and/or transmission in it and keep running it for a long time.

1,Death Trap,Austin ,08/24/2015,1,3,3,,,1,1,2,5,,,"We had a 2008 Town & Country had every option to it. Including Swivel n'Go, and Walter P Chrysler Package. Well Our journey with it was OK. But it started to have issues I mean a lot of issues. Down to the point of it having a poorly made suspension. My families almost death experience was because of Chryslers poor engineering team. The story of this start in March of 2013 when my family and I were on our way to Myrtle Beach, SC for Spring Break. They trip was going fine for the first four hours of our trip but once we got around the Louisville, Kentucky area; we got a really bad shaking in our suspension so we pulled off at the nearest rest area. We checked all the tires to find that they looked perfectly normal and had no bulges in them. So we proceed to drive down the Interstate going about 75 MPH and all of a sudden it felt like the rear axle had fallen off the vehicle. The van goes immediately into a fish tale and luckily didn't flip over because at one point we were completely sideways going down the interstate. After the Van had come to a stop my family completely in utter disbelief get out of the van to find that our wheel had sheered off the wheel hub assembly. After a tow truck was called and the van was taken to the Chrysler dealership we found out that it was caused by a manufacture defect that wasn't able to take the load of six people and luggage; that the stress on the axle was to great. We no longer have this van and no longer feel safe inside a Chrysler product. We now own a 2013 Ford Flex SEL and it has taken us a lot more places with a bigger load with no issues. Anybody reading this review DON'T BUY THIS VAN Especially if you have kids. I recommend looking at the Ford Flex best car we have owned. Learn from our Mistake and don't buy the van.

2,BUYER BEWARE!! DON'T BUY!!!,Angela ,07/18/2015,1,3,3,,,1,3,2,3,,,"Run away as fast as you can from the 2008 Chrysler Town & Country Touring minivan.  We purchased this vehicle pre-owned in July of 2013 and we are currently in the month of July 2015.  Since we have owned the vehicle, we have had to change the front brakes 3 times and the rear brakes once, as well as, the rotars for the front braking system.  We use a 5w-20 Synthetic Blend oil and we are always needing to add at least 2 quarts before the next oil change. The minivan only has approximately 77,7xx miles. Which is still relatively low as far as mileage is concerned on a vehicle.  I called the dealership and I was informed that this is a common problem for the 2008 Chrysler minivan.  For some reason after it reaches 50K miles, the vehicle is designed to burn more oil; per Technician.  (What a funny man, right?) Anyways, since March of 2015 to July 17, 2015, our back rear top brake light bar stopped working and it caused our check engine light to trigger.  Of course, according to 2 major, well-known auto parts store that it is a Dealship repair. I was given the estimate of $200-$400 for a replacement part. Next the top radiator hose blew a nice, quarter size hole to the plastic connector piece. We weren't able to replace that piece, because it required the entire assembly to be replaced, which was very close to a $500 repair. I can not forget to mention all the squeaky noises the vehicle has during the winter months. Such as the dvd compartment area rattles and squeaks, something on the the passenger row door squeaks (similar noise to a torn cv boot). The plastic bracket that holds the sunvisor in place, has fallen out, because the screw appears to be stripped. The A/C blower fan was operating loudly. Once again, was informed it was a common problem for this type of vehicle and a $250 repair cost. The day before family vacation in May 2015, the cable for the passenger row door snapped. That was quoted at approximately $700 for THAT repair. Then today, as I was doing errands, the check engine light came on. I had a diagnostic test performed and now I have 2 more issues. 1) The ECM has detected that brake switch 2 is applied while brake switch 1 is open. 2) EGR position sensor rationality closed. Meaning The ECM is detecting EGR flow or movement when it is not expected. Probable cause: Failed EGR Solenoid, Failed EGR position sensor, & Failed EGR valve. Yes, another expensive repair. Estimate is between $200-$400 and we also have 2 separate recall notices, which neither have been repaired. The dealership doesn't know when the parts from the factory will become available and it could take anywhere from 3-5 years before the repairs take place. Unfortunately, this is absolutely the worst vehicle we have ever owned!!!  A disheartening factor is I was a previous owner of a brand new 2001 Chrysler Sebring. It was the best vehicle with very few problems. When we decided to purchase the Chrysler minivan, I was elated. I was certain we had made a great choice based on my previous experience. I was so wrong on so many levels.  Sad to say, but with relief, we will no longer purchase another Chrysler!!  I'm looking forward to a much better, less stressful experience  that will not become a money pit witin 2 years.",,

Driving this van is a bit scary. You never no when it will shut off and you lose your power steering and brakes. The engine lights comes on and stays on. The break lights come on and stay on. The airbag light comes on and stays on. The low traction lights come on when the engine dies. Sometimes it doesn't start for several tries. So far I haven't been rear ended! I have replaced tires, and both sets of breaks. I've had it just over 2 years. I've had 4 recalls so far, can't fix it locally and they will do it one at a time.

The first week we owned it the EGR valve went bad. The brakes are new so haven't replaced them yet in 6 months. Seems to wear the tires pretty quick. Sounds like a wheel bearing is going bad lately. The interior has some cheap spots as the handle for the gear shift fell off as did the sun visor. The gas mileage is averaging 18 mpg which is mix of town and highway.

timing belt, water pump, spark plugs, pcv valve, front brakes and rotors, shocks, struts, flushed all the fluids including coolant, tranny, brakes, power steering.

I have steel plates in my spine and the seats are very comfortable. Interior lighting is great. Power doors are very useful when arms and hands are full. 6 speed tranny is smooth and great on the highway. All windows open - nice ventilation. Stow 'n Go is awesome.,Center console is difficult to move back to second row. It's also big and bulky but with very little storage. Arm rests in thrid row would be nice if they were hinged to reveal storage.

I think the leather seems very soft and that may be a problem with kids and that is the only reason I gave a score of 8 on interior. Similarly I think it should hold up but the exterior could have used better quality plastics. Overall performance on 4.0 engine, fun factor, the electronics on board are great, considering this is a mini-van. The doors were acting up but dealer is not trained well or they do not have a good problem database.  My friend who has the same van showed me how to fix the problem by tightening a hex screw on each door - DONE.  Need wider set of tires and need the spare tire in a better place - come on!","My favorite features are the electronics on board: radio/xm/dvd/dual-screens/110v plug etc, backup camera, self-leveling system, multi use third-row seat and powerful engine.

The Bridgstone tires (on the 17"" wheels) are terribly soft sidewalled, so handling is sloppy. Replacements will have lower profile and stiffer walls. The interior is still the best available.  No swivel here.  We love the stow-and-go. MyGig and Nav are nice improvements too.  The light colored seats are just stupid! After 2 days, the driver's seat was dirty. Shifter placement takes getting used to. Overall: Better than previous year.","MyGig! 4.0L engine is big improvement, 6-speed Transmission is smoother, Road noise is lessened, Interior LED lighting, back-up camera is welcomed, Remote start is fun, Still very family friendly.  A great value when compared to other 7 passenger vehicles. Gas mileage is acceptable for car this size","Chrysler took the best looking minivan and turned it into the ugliest! The shifter placement is weird.  Light colored (actually, it was the darkest available with silver) ""Limited"" interior show slightest dirt in 2 days. Fire the design staff! When this leased car is turned in it will look terrible."
4.5,T&C touring eition,NormB ,05/23/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Just completed a 1500 mile trip in our 2008 T&C touring edition. This is a well thought out vehicle, with lots of nifty features- mygig, heated power seats, etc. The van handled very well on the (mostly freeway) trip. Good power from the 3.8 V6. The braking is very good. I averaged almost 25 MPG, which is better than I expected to get. That should improve a bit as it gets fully broken in. I think the 6 speed transmission helped with the high ""overdrive"" gearing.  Here's a tip - my Chrysler dealer offered bumper to bumper lifetime warranty for around $2,000. A quick internet search found other Chrysler dealers selling the same thing for $1500 or so.",Versatile interior. Power doors and rear hatchback. MYGIG/Serious radio. Very comfortable front seats.,Interior finish and materials doesn't match up to the Honda/Toyota or even Kia quality. Too much hard plastic and sharp angles.

I had to drive with my lift gate not closed to the closet dealer.  I have only heard rave reviews on this new van and the creature comfort won me over.  I hope I made the right decision.,"Love my entertainment package.  It is great traveling with my kids 13 (who is already 5""6) and my 8 year old kids.  Two screen system is the best.",Do something about the organic brake pad dust.  It is very unsightly.

But seeing how we were hit in a major front end collision last week that totaled our Nissan Quest, we had to find another van quickly with our family of 5 plus pets.   So I did my research, asked around when I'd see a T&C driver in a parking lot-and got very positive reviews.  We got our Touring edition for the same cost as a stripped down Toyota or Honda!!   We've been driving around all night in our new van.  The kids LOVE the swivel and go seats & the dual dvd screens! For once they have begged to get in the van! LOL","The entertainment package, the MyGIG system, the swivel & go seats, storage space in the floor",Leave off the fake woodgrain inside & make the center console a little more sturdy.

The gas mileage calculator that is built-in is flawed as I manually calculated it on a recent trip and it was 3 MPG higher.   The Mygig system is great and the NAV system is pretty solid.  I wish it had traffic updates outside of major cities, but I can live without.  The interior is very roomy. The lighting in the van is exceptional.  I would recommend this van to anyone.  I think the interior is average quality wise - some nice things, but some cheap things as well.  But the same is true in most cars - including my Toyota.","Mygig, Dual DVD, Sat TV, Stow and Go, Lots of room, Power door.",Improve fit and finish on interior slightly .

I drive a semi for a living, and get kidded to no end for my owning and driving a mini van. Soccer mom is what they call me! And I ain't a mom!  The T&C is a great vehicle. It rides like a Caddy, has more room than my pick up and is fantastic for those trips to Sam's and Costco. We have no kids, but the utility of these vans is incredible!

This is the first time we splurged on""accessories"" in a car but it was all worth it.  We just got back from a road-trip to Florida from New York.  I have 3 kids (11, 9 & 6) and they could not have been happier with the satellite TV. We're not huge TV people but it is a great way of breaking up car-time.  This is also the first time that we hit no traffic taking our annual road trip to FL without hitting any traffic. I give the superior navigation system and Sirius traffic all the credit.

We primarily bought it due to the excellent price for the number of features. It's not as powerful and doesn't have the car- like handling some of the competitors do, but it is clearly better than the previous T&C. It's very quiet on smooth surfaces, but you do get quite a bit of noise from the tires & suspension when on broken pavement. The power sliding doors were the weak link on our previous T&C, and it looks like they may still be a problem area (one side is already making a funky sound and doesn't always want to close). Fuel mileage is close to the EPA numbers, if you go easy on the throttle. Kids love the dual DVD Players.","6 speed transmission, Yokohama tires, MyGig system, dual DVDs, heated seats, driver info center allows you to customize many functions, stow & go seats, rechargeable flashlight.","Power doors seem unreliable, spare tire is very hard to reach (very difficult just to check air pressure), floor above the stow & go seats seems cheap/tinny, leather seats seem too hard, not as comfortable as the cloth seats, automatic climate control should be standard on Touring trim level."

If you have kids, there is nothing better to make your trips enjoyable. Traded a Highlander, and love the extra room. Looked at Swivel & Go, and went with Stow & Go. Ability to stow the middle seats is extremely handy. Pleasantly surprised at highway mileage, almost 25 MPG with 4.0 V6, about 17 around town.  Wanted the Touring edition, but dealer made great deal for a Limited, happy we went with that model. The technology built in is amazing.  ",Back Seat TV. Top of line sound system is awesome.

I'm 6'3"" and the driver leg room, with the electric seat all the way back, is so much less than previous years - my right leg is hurting from having to raise my foot to function the brake. In addition, this car is getting 30% less miles per gallon than my '07 T&C - under 13 miles per gallon in the city! I am very unhappy with the car and would return it, but the dealer wants to charge me 25% ($7,500) on a trade and I have only 1200 miles.

4.125,"My Gig, My Disappointment",IMJR ,04/19/2008,,,5,4,3,2,,5,5,4,5,"Our troubles began approximately 2 wks after our purchase. The MyGig system has given us plenty of trouble. It has frozen up, it turns off and on by itself, the volume will go to 100% and then down to mute, CDs will lock up, the touch screen will not respond, the Nav screen will freeze up, and more. Including the hard system, computer and touch screen, we are on our fourth system to include all the software updates but to no avail. We are also having issues with the side doors; they are overly sensitive consequently they retract with the slightest pressure. If it were not for the issues with the My Gig system, the 2008 T&C would definitely be our family's all time favorite vehicle.","We love the ability to set our individual temp.  The heated seats are wonderful but could have an option to heat the bottom or the back separately. When it works, the MyGig system is awesome.  The remote start is especially nice on cold mornings. The remote doors are nice when yours hands are full.","Middle chairs need more room in order to recline further. At 5'7"", it is hard to get comfortable when driving.

My wife's previous vehicle was a 01 T&C with 139K miles which we traded for this new T&C. I am a life long Corvette owner. Let me tell you, I argue with my wife daily in letting me drive this vehicle. Chrysler invented the Minivan, they have to made it so much better. I love to be seen in this vehicle, everywhere I stop people ask me about the vehicle. I just reply ""it is like being in your family room with the added feature of movement"". To date I have not seen a crossover that can compete with this vehicle. The days of a minivan not being a ""cool"" vehicle are over.

The dumb keyless fob that you still need to insert and turn.  The moronic positioning of the bloody shifter.  It actually feels smaller and cramped inside.

4.75,Carpool Heaven,Annette ,01/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Swivel n go is the best for carpool. The kids pop in and out with so much ease.  The toughest part is deciding who gets to sit backward.  It rides smooth.  The entertainment options are super for a long car ride.  The LED lights make it so easy to drive at night and let kids still do homework, read books etc.  I really like the new exterior, less of an attempt at sporty --it's a minivan.  The MyGig is impressive, but can take too much attention while driving.  Love the Bluetooth built in.  Second row cupholders are only bottle on the door less than ideal.  ","MyGig bluetooth, swivel and go, table if we are traveling and the LED lights",The second row needs cup holders that flip out from the side of the seat for fast-food beverages.  And the third row DVD screen needs to turn around so the second row can view it when the seats are turned around. Right now you have to turn the seats for viewing.
4.5,"08 T&C LX, 24H package, 2nd Row DVD",wrexracer ,01/08/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,4,4,"I really enjoy this van. The stow and go is great. The equipment and pricing were outstanding also. The fold away 2nd row seats will also come in handy the few times I need to haul things. The driving performance is good.  I opted for the 3.3L engine, so I knew that it wasn't going to be a world beater.  ","Backup camera, stow and go, hard drive","Better gas mileage, more power, diesel engine, true manual transmission  I would also like to be able to move the 2nd row seats to a side by side configuration."
4.375,Touch choice between T&C or Odyssey,Ben ,01/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,3,"The Odyssey is awesome and absolutely a better drive at any trim level then the T&C. However, if you closely compare the standard feature set on the Honda and compare it to the T&C it becomes clear that if you care more about value and less about handling and performance (it's a minivan!) then the T&C wins. I bought a Touring T&C with the M package for 29,000 dollars. A similar Honda costs almost 4000 more at invoice. Personally I don't think the Honda's moon roof and engine superiority warrant a 4 thousand dollar difference.  Figure in Chrysler's life time drivetrain warranty along with it's feature set and you have a great value.  BTW - I think the Limited kills the T&Cs value over Honda.","Entertainment system! It's ridiculously awesome. Music choices; satellite, AM, FM, DVD, CD, Hard drive. 3 screens(!)  Warm interior; it feels more upscale then previous generation.  Thoughtful design; such as built in flashlight, 2nd row heated seats, windows shades, tailgate mode. Lots of space.","The 4.0 should be standard and suddenly Honda is far less attractive. The 3.8 is plain, dull, and reminds you too much of what you're driving.  Too much cheapish plastic in the interior.  Mileage isn't pleasing. Without a lot of freeway driving the average mileage is 16 mpg."
4.375,"2008 T&C LX, 24H, Second row DVD",WrexRacer ,01/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,4,3,"I've only had the vehicle a few weeks, but the interior layout is very good.  The layout is better than our 2001 Odyssey.  The smaller engine definitely lacks power.  The automatic transmission tries to compensate, which causes the gas mileage to be a little lower than I would like.  But the you can shift gears yourself to compensate.  The DVD player is nice.  As are the wireless headphones.  The rear parking camera is great.  The stow and go gives a ton of interior space for storage.  The second glovebox is also nice.  After the transmission failure on our last van, the lifetime warranty on the Chrysler put us in this van over the entry level Toyota Sienna.","Park view camera, stow and go, auto shift","Better gas mileage, true manual transmission, diesel engine"
2,1st & Last Chrysler,abilenebeth ,01/04/2008,,,3,3,1,1,,1,3,3,1,"I should have known. I had a bad feeling as  the ink was drying on the paperwork at the dealership. We bought a brand new 2008 Town & Country stow and go on Saturday, Dec. 29th. As the salesman was delivering the car, we couldn't get the keyless start to work. So service had to fix it. Then yesterday, a warning beep sounds and a light comes on that says ""ESP BAS.""  ESP is not defined in the owner's manual and BAS doesn't even appear.  If you don't know the acronym you're left clueless. When I called the dealership, even the service manager didn't know what ESP BAS stood for.  He had to look it up.  I had to return to the dealer, taking time out of my weekday to do so to have it fixed. ",They couldn't fix it.  They had to order a part.  The car has 106 miles on it and has broken twice.  And now I get to take off and sit and wait to get it fixed again when the part finally comes in. I've bought my first and last Chrysler.  Should have stuck with Ford.,Don't deliver a car to a dealership that needs to be serviced four times before it reaches 110 miles!  (The car needed repair twice before it was sold.  I saw the record on the service desk this morning.  Of course no one at the dealership TOLD me this when we bought it!)
5,Chrysler back on top!,golddog ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We just purchased a 2008 Black Limited w/ navigation and sunroof.  Did not opt for DVD since no kids and 3 dogs.  Overall first impressions are great.  Smooth ride, comfortable, very quiet.  Fit and finish looks great.  Navigation is easy to use as is the bluetooth function.  Voice recognition is a little difficult to setup.  Previously owned a Toyota Sienna which had several recalls, not as comfortable, and overall did not impress.  Traded a 2007 Hyundai Entourage for Chrysler.  The Hyundai was a good van but lacked several features and depreciation faster than you could imagine.  Put this van at the top of your list!","Navigation, bluetooth, interior, 3 zone temp control, rear view camera and sound system.",None at this time.
4.875,Love It!,Melissa ,12/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"It's great to have a minivan that my friends without kids actually think is cool! It looks more like an SUV from the outside now, and the luxury inside is the nicest I've seen. I've had it a couple months now and I am so happy with our decision to buy.","The MyGig radio, navigation, and Sirius radio and TV, the sunshades. So many things to list- Oh I can't forget the backup camera, it gives me such peace of mind.  ",I think they thought of everything!
5,Switch from LandRover to Town & Country,Bret Boyd ,12/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great family vehicle. Kids love the Sirius TV, swivel seats. Dad loves the nav system, heated seats, ergonomics. Wife loves the kids & dad being happy. Tested Honda and looked at Toyota. It was no-brainer plus you have a lifetime warranty on powertrain.","Wanted all the amenities that a luxury car offers. Bluetooth, nav, reverse sensors & camera, heated seats, & we needed 7 passenger capabilities & found it in the limited Town & Country with every option available        ",Offer a diesel. 
5,Amazing,Shmorgan ,12/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We frequently trade in cars, and for the past several years, we have adored the town and country. I will admit, the old van, without the dvd player, kinda felt just like a people mover, nothing special, though it has been through a lot. The new one, is much more improved, and i absolutely love it. We had to go with the swivel seats and i dont think they have faced forward since we drove it off the lot!","Hands down, swivel seats, and of course the tv! Playing katamari damacy while driving can be very fun also!","i would suggest re-working the suspension just a tad. the ride is much better than previous T&Cs, though wheel skid made me a little unnerved, and im sure the jenga game in the commercial had some effects on it, though, otherwise, it is wonderful!"
5,Awesome Vehicle!,Mom of 4 ,12/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Our family just loves this van!  I love the bigger motor--it drives much like a high-end SUV I used to drive. We also like the updated body style, backseat TV-free for one year with select models. (Disney, Nick, & Cartoon Net), along w/Sirius radio-- can't go wrong and you will get extra points with your kids for buying such a cool vehicle. If you have kids, this is the vehicle you need--you won't be disappointed.  The GPS system is very user-friendly, and for those of you who tend to take a few wrong turns now and then, you are in luck with the navigation system=it gets you there! ","Being able to listen to my news/music while the kids enjoy movies, backseat tv, or music on their headsets.  They don't mind a bit.","One suggestion would be to make it a bit easier to remove the table.  The chairs must be swivelled in order to remove it. My husband has to help me, as it really takes two people to do it.  Also, the swivel seats do take up a good deal of space--there is less leg room than my other T&C's."
4.75,A Minivan that I Want to Drive,Brian ,12/13/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"We have two toddlers and a teenager and we were looking for a vehicle that accomodated the family and all our things.  We have been resisting the minivan market, but the Family Room on Wheels commercial made us test drive the T&C.  We ended up buying it and absolutely love it.  The toddlers are disappointed when they have to ride with me in my Tahoe.  The ride is great, it rides like a car with minimal interior noise and an overall smooth ride.  The seats are comfortable and the features are endless.  We have the dark blue with cream interior which looks great and the amount of chrome outside really makes the colors pop.  Here goes...I love my minivan!","Dual DVD system, satellite TV, MyGIG navigation system, swivel and go seats, remote start, automatic side doors and rear hatch, 4.0L engine, smooth ride, sound system, appearance.",Seatbelts on rear seat seem to be set forward too far resulting in them coming straight down or if rear seat is slighly reclined backwards.  Nothing else at this point.
4.75,Best  of the litter,Bob ,11/17/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"After owning three Chrysler minivans we decided to buy a new van this fall. We looked at the Honda, Toyota and Chrysler vans and decided that the Chrysler fitted our needs better than the other two. The Chrysler has not disappointed. It is extremely quiet, rides well,and has plenty of power with the 4.0 L engine which has given us better than 20 miles per gallon since we have owned the van. The stow and go seating is great for carrying big stuff. So far so good and we are looking for a good number of happy years driving this vehicle.         ",The quietness and solid feeling while driving is wonderful and the sound system is great. You can load up enough music to last for days.,The only complaint I can make is that the engine and exhaust system is noisy when over 3000 rpm. 
4.375,08 T&C - 1 week report,Joe ,11/15/2007,,,5,4,4,4,,4,5,4,5,"I decided to surprise my wife on our 12th anniversary with a new T&C - one of the few good decisions in my life!  The 08 has decent exterior styling (a bit boxy) but make no mistake - it is the interior that is gorgeous.  Ours is loaded with pretty much everything. The neon lights with the backlighting around the DVD consoles makes it pure business class. Power 3rd row seat folders - brilliant.  The MyGIG entertainment and navigation is brilliant.  Fantastic ride, smooth even on horrible Michigan roads.  Wife loves it, kids love it - what can I say - Dad is suddenly cool.  ","Most everything - myGig, lighting, styling, power trunk, power seat folder, remote start, nav, bluetooth, rear sensor, comfort, ride quality, tight finish, decent power.  Well thought out machine.  ",Not much - make music navigation a little easier (too distracting on the road); include seat memory with entertainment option.  Hope this thing will last us for years and years. I got it for $28K with supplier discount.  
4.75,Good Car for the Family...Impressed,AcuraFan ,11/10/2007,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,5,5,"I personally drive an Acura RDX, and love it. My wife decided to look into the minivan section. I first off said Honda Odyssey, but didn't turn down the chrysler. When I first saw it, I thought wow. This really looks nice. Almost like an SUV. It drives ok, though the steering can be stiff at times, and fun to drive. Numerous options. Love the dual DVD for the kids, TV really helps. Swivel 'n Go finally gets them playing the million games they never use. We've had it for 2 months and love it.","Dual DVD, My GIG/ navigation, swivel seats, stylish","Better fuel economy, smaller swivel seats; comfy but take up a lot of space, they wont have enough leg room when the kids are 13 years old, dont lose the overhead console going all the way back when you get the sunroof, AWD as an option-still like the car, these are just suggestions"
5,It's inside that counts!,Stan ,11/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"When our lease on Pacifica was up, we came to the dealership with our 2 kids. There was this ""living room on wheels"" on display. We all got inside and were amazed. Hey, we are still amazed. I agree that its boxy behind is not very sexy, but it is amazingly practical. It is the insides that count. Starting from the 4.0 very powerful engine to 3 tvs (driver can watch tv when the van is in Parked gear), to the only available vehicle with a Satellite TV, it is the best all-around car for a family. I especially like to see the surprised faces of the drivers I just passed in my rearview mirror, who don't expect such a performance from a minivan. Move over, the fastest living room on wheels is here","UConnect: you don't even have to have to wear a Bluetooth earring, just talk to the dashboard (although from another car it does look like you are nuts, talking to your car!)","The middle-row stowaway seats could be made smaller, foldable (like in Pacifica) for an easier passage to the third row."
4.25,Great Van for the family,Good Van ,10/26/2007,,,5,5,4,4,,4,5,3,4,"We just bought this van and all I have to saw is that we are surprised. This van substituted my wife's 2005 VW Passat Wagon (which we loved), but we needed more space for the kids.  I must admit that I was concerned about buying american, but after seeing the price and the initial reviews we decided to give it a try.  All I can say is, wow.  I was impressed by the looks, quality and overall feel of the vehicel.  It does not corner like a sporty sedan, but it is comfortable on the roads.  The traction control and brake assist are Awsome.  My wife has driven through a few rain storms and she reporetd that she felt the car's braking and handling in the rain we just like her old passat :).","Swivel and go seating is very cool when hanging out with the kids and playing board games during road trips.  3 (yes, three) media systems to keep everyone occupied.  The satellite TV is awsome, and the fact that dueling siblings can simultaneously watch satellite TV and a DVD is a blessing.  ","This van only needs a diesel engine to be the perfect family van.  The fuel economy is not good (we were used to a TDI Passat 37 actual MPG on highway).  Chrysler if you are listening, please make a diesel van. You would have a customer for life!"
5,All around nice van,michele ,10/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"When my lease was up on my Jeep, I was going to purchase another SUV.  However, upon returning to the selling dealer, I looked over the new body style Town and Country.  I loved it, I never wanted to be a soccer mom, but it have every option and the new styling makes it look more sporty and lower to the groud.  It is super comfortable and the new engine is quiet.","Mygig navigation system, I don't have to lug my ipod around anymore.","I wish it came in all wheel drive, the dealer stated it is not possible with the stow and go feature, which my husband wouldn't do without.  This van has the edge with that feature."
2.25,Big Mistake,Mike ,10/07/2007,,,2,4,1,1,,2,3,2,3,"The performance is horrible, and I wish I didn't buy this car. Gas mpg is horrible with the big iron block 4.0 liter. Iv'e had this van for 1 month and I have had constant problems. The transmission is very sluggish and the swivel and go seats are very unsafe. My friend got in a crash with her kids in a 2008. the seats were swiveld and her kids got serious whiplash. I want to trade it in when lease is up for a new Honda Odyssey. I don't like the the power doors, because my son got his finger stuck and door did not reverse. So let me tell you what has happened in 1 month. My car gets horrible gas milage, my sons finger is severly bruised and my friends daughters have whiplash. Don't buy this!",None,Everything
5,The Mercedes of Minivans,DougW ,09/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Whats an amazing change from the old shape to this new shape, everything is different. I like the little touches that really make this car feel like a high end European car vs the cheap plastic trip we have gotten used to in our domestic minivans. The first major improvement is the room for the driver and 2nd row passengers. I am 6'3"" (long torso) and i have zero problems driving this car or sitting in the 2nd row (swivel n go). We did test drive the stow n go 2nd row and the seat backs were just too low down for me, the top of headrest was below my shoulders so we had to go for the swivel n go anyway which are bucket heater leather seats just like the front (we have the 25L package).","Swivel and Go seating is excellent, you can turn the second row 90 degrees (facing you while you are standing outside the van) to put kids in and take kids out of their car seats, it also has very easy to access latch system for car seats to attach. Rear backup camera is also very cool.","Longer standard warranty like a 4yr 48K instead of a 3yr 36k would be better, I hate the final hour upsell from the dealer and would rather pay more for the car if it already came with it. Also, we were offered a heavily discounted lifetime bumper to bumper for $2800, but its not transferable."
