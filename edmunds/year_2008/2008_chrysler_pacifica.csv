5,Great driving experience!,twistedtoes ,02/24/2014,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I, for the life of me can't understand why Chrysler stopped building such a great driving experience of the Pacifica. I'm totally amazed at how well this piece of equipment handles itself on the highway as well as in town. It's not sluggish when you want to pass another car and the fact that it's interfaced with Mercedes - Benz technology only adds to the driving experience. I just paid mine off, so the ride just got better!","Luxurious interiors of leather, heated seats, dual climate controls (front, middle and rear) all of the bells and whistles I could get for this unique vehicle. I would tell people that my Pacifica had everything in it but a Coke machine and ice maker. Great handling. The 4.0L engine acts more like it's turbocharged when you need the power to get moving. Love the 6 speed tranny, it gets lots of use when going down steep roads in town - saves on the brakes. Backup cameras and the automatic rear door hatch and it came out before anyone else even thought about it.",I think the only thing that Chrysler can do to make things better for this fine automobile is to start making them again. Truly one of the better driving experiences I've had in a long time.
5,I was foolish enough to get rid of 2004...,chinatown ,10/27/2013,,,5,,,4,,4,5,,,"I had thought it was using oil. However, I later found out that it is normal with these cars as the lighter weight which improves the mileage is the reason.Oh well.Anyway an earlier post indicated the MP3 problem. I also experienced same. I later found this solution, after I had traded it in.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=294TFX3b5-AHope this is viewed by the current owners.",,
2.875,Finally getting rid of it.,robrob1 ,06/22/2011,,,4,4,2,1,,3,5,2,2,"Only the tip of the Iceberg. After 3,000 miles, they tried to fix the dreaded chronic transmission problems . (do a Google search).The sight of seeing the tranny in pieces from my new car made me regret my purchase instantly. They never really fixed the problem, so I was frustrated for 48 months. This car is also a MAJOR GAZ GUZZLER. In cold weather, the ''dual-exhaust'' system makes an unbelievable racket. Radio controls (and sound) are worthy of a '70's Corolla, cheap plastic and all. The idea for this car was right, but implementation was an unfinished nightmare. Too bad, it was full of promises. Pros: good ride, seats ok, roomy. Returning it next week, at long, long last. Good riddance.","Ride quality.
Felling of safety you get when riding in a tank.
Seats are only comfortable when you find the correct driving position, which is hard to do.","Improvement on the cheesy radio controls.
Confusing heat/vent layout.
Put in a worthy transmission.
Put in an extra overdrive gear.
Better quality rubber around the doors.
Improve gas mileage.
Trim down the weight of the car.
Make electric hatch opening standard.
Make plugging-in an MP3 player possible.
(even the cheapest econo-box has this).

I'm stopping here, this car is no longer made after all, but I could fill a book."
2.75,Not recommended,Yolanda English ,10/09/2010,,,1,4,4,2,,4,3,1,3,"I bought my Pacifica for my birthday earlier this year. I was interested in it because I needed the 3rd row and was tired of being in a many van & I though it was cute. But having the 3rd row seat, it has no trunk room. You can't ride with the back windows down because of the noise the air pressure makes and it's a gas guzzler. I wouldn't recommend this car to my worst enemy. Also, when my batter died, I couldn't even turn the key to put the car in neutral to roll it back. To me, that's just not right. ","I don't really have any favorite features, I do like the look of it. It's sleek and rides smooth. But that's about it. ",I suggest you make more trunk room. Maybe make the far rear window vent open so the middle windows won't cause so much air pressure and make it a little more economic on the gas. 
4.875,Please start making the Pacifica again!,Russ ,10/04/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,We bought a 2007 base model for our son to tour with his band and we had been looking for a late model Pacifica for a while ourselves.  A loaded Limited fell into our laps.  We could not have been more pleased.  Ride is great. Seats and all the adjustments and memory are required for us with me 6-4 and wife 5-4 although I don't give up the driving duties much.  It is our long distance car and I love to drive it.  Chrysler HAS to reintroduce this car!!,"lumbar support and seat adjustments are the best.  Navigation and back up camera are perfect.

When we heard they weren't making them anymore we turned in our 2006 model for an upgraded Touring 2008. I can't even compare the two cars because they are so different. This is definitely my favorite car i have ever owned and love the comfort and feeling of safety traveling with my family. i hope it lasts forever, or they decide to start making them again. I wish both my cars were pacificas.","Safety, look, comfort, the heated leather seats (and before this I refused to even consider leather interior), the DVD player in the back.

We have LOVED it! Definitely an upgrade from our economy car before ;-) If you're looking for a car that's just the right size with lots of amenities, give the car a look.  *Disclaimer: Have only owned a few months, so I cannot attest to long-term reliability, but we are not worried about it ourselves.",,"If the 3rd row seats reclined, they would fit smaller adults pretty comfortably - they're too upright."
3.125,A problem no one can fix,Bob ,01/08/2010,,,4,4,2,2,,3,4,2,4,"When first starting my 2008 Pacifica, it sounds like the starter remains engaged with the flywheel for a few seconds. More so when cold than subsequent attempts. Starter replaced, problem not solved. Dealership is now saying the power steering fluid maybe thickening up due to the cold weather and the power steering maybe causing noise. Find this hard to believe for a car with less than 25k (or at all). Had other problems (tie rod, brakes, rattling noise in the interior) since purchasing vehicle with 18+k miles on it. Too many for a such a newer vehicle in my opinion.","Like the interior room, back up camera, size and handling.  Get 24 mpg on hwy. Like 4.0L V6.

5,Great Car! So Far...,Brennen ,09/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I absolutely love my Pacifica. I have the Signature Series with all the extras. Although I was worried that having so many power features could potentially mean expensive repair bills, this has not been an issue thus far. The Pacifica is extremely comfortable for four passengers, but it could have used a little more leg room in the third row.

What a difference. Must faster from the light, better milage on the highway but about the same mpg here in the Arkansas mountain community.  Did replace air filter with K&N and use synthetic oil.

Too bad they didn't get it right initially but they have it right now, just in time to discontinue the line. What a shame, this is one of the best vehicles Chrysler has ever made. I bought one of the last of the 08 model year and hopefully it'll last a long time. The lifetime powertrain warranty should ensure that it does.",Very ergonomically friendly.
