Sure just had to bring it in for regular maintenance but with the 7 year warranty coming to an end this month we traded it in for a beautiful fully loaded 2015 Limited. While no transmission issues like a lot of people have, my 2015 has a lot of electrical issues that just piss you off! However, my 2008 was a Jeep and it drove like a truck. Crappy gas mileage but a great all around car, no electrical or engine issues ever. Had a small hole in muffler at the end that I didn't repair because I was getting rid of but it was very reliable.

First the tranny at 35k (in the end Jeep's Chief Engineer diagnosed the problem), 6 months in shop; the rear end at 60k, in a month, centre differential at 75k, 2 months in shop, centre diff again, at 80k. Now at 115k the tranny and centre diff apparently have badly leaking seals and both are being pulled and repaired to be safe (3 months so far). No warranty now so $3500 plus GST.  I AM NOT HAPPY!

It feels like luxury without removing the rugged look Jeep has.
It has several different options like MP3 CD, 6 CD changer, AUX and Satellite.

While other SUVs with 3rd row seating come with 4.0 engine, they are faster.
Jeeps have a 3.7 and seem sluggish at times.
I wish I could get the 4.0 engine without a V8 for speed.
You end up using more gas but choose one:
smaller engine and slow with lower mpg or bigger engine, speed and higher mpg.
Sometimes you need that speed to get out of the way of the crazies."

After driving a reliable, but small import car the previous eight years I chose the Grand Cherokee because of it's size and because the (paved) roads where I currently live have so many potholes it is almost like driving off-road.  The Grand Cherokee handles great, has great visibility, and I don't have to wince each time I hit a pothole like I had to with my small car.

It covers all dimensions of what you would want.  It still is a ""prestigious"" vehicle to drive and show off, the off road capabilities are excellent (which is very useful in snow/rain situations, it has enough cargo space to haul a number of different kinds of large items, and the handling at high or low speeds is not that much different than my previous sporty CAR.  I commute a total of 40 miles each day, sometimes i take the highway, sometimes regular roads.  It performs great on either, and my average MPG on the gauge has been steady at 17.1 - not too bad.","Four Wheel Drive, Ipod aux outlet in stereo, stereo sound quality, being able to run over anything/everything.  ","The V-6 that i have is adequate in all situations, it is not slow.  However, as someone who can get impatient waiting for other drivers, i think upgrading to the V-8 is a good idea.

I found my 08 Jeep marked down to a very affordable price and made the choice over many others cars and SUVs were were looking at.  My Jeep is about as basic as they come, but I was not looking for top of the line nor could I afford it.  The only thing I can saw 100% I wish I had was better fuel economy, but I knew what I was getting when I got an SUV.  I think the cruise control should be back on the steering wheel, or wheel mounted radio controls should be on all models.  I wish I had the roof rack.  I probably wouldn't use it, but it adds to the look.",I love the look of the Jeep Grand Cherokee in and out.  The interior design is great other than the cruise controls.

One problem so far, a rattle in the rear passenger side area. Turned out to be loose side airbag bracket and was fixed promptly by the dealer.  The other day I was trying to back into my garage. Driveway was snow and ice covered and on small incline. What happened next the right rear wheel started spinning and I had to get some momentum to get the rear inside. Once the rear got inside and was on dry concrete, the front wheel started spinning and again would not move. Again had to get momentum to get in.

We couldn't be happier with our decision.  From the build quality of the Jeep brand (my father has an 04 with 120,000 miles) to our dealership provided LIFETIME warranty, this vehicle has it all.  We purchased a certified pre-owned Grand Cherokee Limited with all of the options except the Xenon headlamps and the 5.7L Hemi engine.

I bought it brand new in 12/08 and got $9,000 worth of rebates and discounts. I haven't had any problems with it so far, but I have only put 4,000 miles on it. Therefore, I cannot comment too much on reliability. I will tell you, though, that many of the reliability complaints about the Grand Cherokee relate to 2005-06 models, which had many issues, indeed. However, many of these issues have been fixed for 2007. For 2008, which is the year of my Jeep, the front-end suffered a light facelift and the interior received a major improvement. Some online data show that reliability has improved dramatically with the 07 model. ","I do like the athletic exterior design a lot, and the interior design makes the whole interior look more solid and robust than it actually is. The front seats are comfortable and supportive. Also, this Jeep rides and handles like a sedan on the road. The transmission is very smooth and responsive.","The V6 engine lacks power and the car gets poor gas mileage, especially when compared to other SUVs in its class.

The 2004 Overland that we traded in was great - but this one really shines.  The design and build quality seem far superior than previous years.  The engine - although thirsty at almost all speeds - is responsive and relatively quiet for its size.  We had 34"" of snow during December and the Jeep navigated the hills and drifts with ease.

I got one with 16k mileage with the Xpackage for an awesome deal! I saw on some of the other models that people left reviews for that they had a problem with water leaking, I drove mine in torrential downpour last night with no problem. I looked at many different kinds of SUV's before choosing this one and I am fully satisfied with my choice. Comfortable, roomy, fun to drive, and an overall great SUV.","Steering wheel controls, mine came with remote start which is a great feature to have, heated seats, overall interior appearance is very nice, computer personal programming, satellite radio, so many to name!","Of course every SUV could use better gas mileage. It says 15 highway on my window sticker, I've been getting around 16.5 mpg, not too bad, but some SUV's get around 20. Locking gas cap would be better too.

Now that gas prices are down - my purchasing a V8 in June when gas was near $4 doesn't look so stupid.   How are people complaining about gas mileage in these reviews?  You saw what the EPA estimates were when you bought it - as long as you're not getting worse mileage than EPA estimates, how can you rate gas mileage as poor?  I'm consistently getting a couple of more mpg in comparison to EPA estimates.   Got 21mpg on 600 mile highway trip recently.","MyGig rocks as do the Boston Acoustic Speakers and Sirius.

It is a very annoying noise, clicking sound. We took it back. They pulled another 08 off the lot into the service garage and had us listen to it. It had the same noise!

If it rains hard I can be assured of water leaking into the drivers compartment. I'm very disappointed by the lack of interest on the part of the dealership and Chrysler on repairing this issue.

I was so impressed with Jeep's exterior,interior and price. I am a loyal Jeep guy and thought about the Land Rover, but the price was not worth the value. I love this truck and I am glad I stuck with Jeep. It is a head turner, very comfortable and the power is unreal. Every morning I look forward to driving to work because of the luxury and sound system and the ride.

It's almost like riding in my Acura TL. There is no squeaks or rattles unlike my TL.  The GC has many techy things like backup camera, auto dimming headlights and auto wipers that I think are great.  I like the new HID lights that really light up the road and adjust automatically depending on road/load conditions. Build quality overall is an 9 overall.  Some door panels do not line up.  Also the drivers seat bottom needs to be replaced because of a pucker in the leather.",HID and all the up to date features the GC has to offer. The Lifetime Warranty is nice to have.

I wanted to buy American, and gave Jeep a chance based primarily on their warranty. It was a great decision. I absolutely love this car.  Jeep used quality materials throughout the car, giving it a solid feel. It rides nice, and is great in the bad weather we can get in the Chicago area.  The acceleration on the 6 cylinder is good, with the mileage being what I expected.

This motor has plenty of power and has decent fuel mileage but not great. Leather interior is very comfortable and all controls are very easy to reach and use.

Too many cavities around the shifter/console area. I have a 6 cyl and it is loud when starting off. No under the hood light as on other similar Jeeps I have owned and I get better gas mileage from my 2001 Jeep. The tach display has been moved to the left which is awkward.

Lots of extras with the Nav, Sat. radio, Bluetooth, Back-up camera, etc. I chose this JGC over the Acura MDX because of what you get for the price.

I've been purchasing Laredo with Rocky Mtn edition - currently equipped with the X-package - perfect for me. Handling is solid as usual. Not as nimble as our Subie Tribeca. Fuel economy is as advertised. Since 05, I'm more confident with the handling. The shift placement of the gears has changed - I'm not certain if for the better or worse. Outside, nice stylings. Inside, huge improvement. Doesn't seem dated anymore as 05 did. Seats are more comfortable. Steering column and seat placement make for good(better) driving posture.

So far I have 2000 miles and expect the mileage to improve a bit. The JGC handles good and seems well put together. The transmission shifts smoothly and haven't heard the ""clunk"" so far. I think Chrysler has finally got the message about their poor quality reputation.
