4,Bought new in 2007 (2008 model),Fred ,12/06/2016,3,4,5,,,4,5,5,5,,,"Can't believe I've owned the vehicle for 9 years.  It was my main driver for 7 of those, now it is a weekend vehicle and I drive a hybrid (Hyundai) as my regular driver.  It was my first diesel vehicle and I love the engine and the gas mileage for such a big vehicle, always around 21 miles per gallon.  It is a very comfortable SUV.  The problem is the cost of maintenance after the ""free maintenance"" period is over.  Whether a dealer or an independent it is super expensive.  I had to repair the rear latch and I did it myself so it wasn't that expensive, but to have that job done they tell me it's easily 400 bucks.  The costs are high also because things like windshield wipers are only available from Mercedes.  Tires are very expensive like all big SUV tires, around 300 bucks apiece for the cheap ones.  Having $1,000 services from independent Mercedes service places is not for the faint hearted.  Parking lights are impossible to change, the independent service place suggested I have them changed when a service requiring the removal of the front bumper is necessary.  I  now have a little more than 100K miles on the vehicle and all things considered it has been reliable, but diesels tend to be very reliable in the engine department.  I use it when I need to haul big items and it is great for that.  I have an old pickup but it is so much nicer to haul things in the Benz.  I can't recommend a used one to anyone that is buying used because they can't afford new, because you won't be able to afford the maintenance.  Maybe a one-owner one like mine might be ok, but I would probably sell mine only when the repair costs became annoying, so think about it.",,

It has been okay but I expected a bit more from a ""luxury"" manufacturer.  At the end of the day, they are about the same as GM, Ford, etc.  The electronic items that fail are really irritating.  To date, we have had the rear hatch lock replaced, the drivers side door lock replaced, and the master window switch on the drivers door replaced.   There aren't any children riding in this vehicle abusing the electronics so I just chalk it up to poor design and / or manufacturing.  On the positive side of things, it still has the original tires and they are still have good tread, the vehicle rides great, looks great, and we enjoy driving it.  We don't drive a lot here in Omaha, NE and put less than 5,000 miles per year on it so it still has only 45,000 total miles on the vehicle.  Hopefully it will live up to the standards of our old C230 Kompressor that is still going strong at over 260,000 miles...",,

I took it on a 600 km trip and performed with ""flying"" colors in the fuel consumption department.","Lots of power. Lots of room inside. 3 power outlets, rain sensing wipers, folding mirrors, power tailgate, great looks, ipod connection and I haven't even tried the steering wheel gearshift controls","arm rest, touch screen navigation system, rear view mirror should be part of the memory settings."

4.875,Better than my Range Rover,asasimone ,05/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"When I had to look for an SUV to replace my 05 Range Rover, I wanted something smaller and hopefully with a bit better fuel economy. I had already leased a BMW X5 and didn't really love it-it was very heavy and ""trucky"". The Lexus R was sort of cheap feeling and I believe if you buy a Lexus or Infiniti, you are paying for the badge not the quality. I thought I would miss the luxury of the Rover, but from the moment I p/u my car I have not looked back. It handles beautifully, feels more like a car, much better mileage already w/o breaking in.  The only thing better on the Rover was the navigation. ","Smooth ride, seat comfort, rear camera.",Touch screen navigation.

Diesel won me over and liked exterior above others. As some have noted, nav (need touch screen, improve intuitive flow) and signal stem (proximity to cruise control) need updating/improvement.  MB could use better value packaging like Lexus. Start w/ P2 and tailor to need. Downshifting non-issue with slight and logical modification of driving habit. Very pleased with choice.","Diesel/mpg, exterior, ipod","Nav (should have been upgraded prior to 09s), signal stem location, second row seat backs could have ability to tilt back"

I love the exterior styling and wanted to love the interior but was very disappointed by everything. The gearshift on the steering column - what were they thinking? And the MBTec standard fake leather is ridiculous on a supposed luxury car. Inside much cheaper looking overall. So my love affair with MLs is coming to an end. My heart is considering buying the one I have now, but my head is telling my to give serious consideration to the Acura MDX I test drove yesterday - don't care much for the look but it's all around higher rated and a better value. I'm sad.",Exterior styling,"Put gearshift back in center console, leather should be standard on any Mercedes, less plastic in interior - very cheap looking. "
5,Best SUV I have ever driven!,Purple-Ginger ,04/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Have had the car for couple of months now. Great power under the hood - the turbo really makes a difference. The fuel economy is excellent. Once you get the hang of it you can get about 32MPG highway and about 20 city - I get about 25-26MPG for 50-50 city/highway. Not bad for an SUV with this size an power. Can't mention enough about the torque! All in all the best SUV I have driven (compared to Lexus, BMW models).  Have taken it to the mountains - starts with ease and pure pleasure to drive up hill - gasoline engines are no match to the power!!!","Interior, turbo diesel engine, mileage, 650+ miles before each fill, torque, parktronics, rear view camera.

4.625,ML 350  Great value!,Chaddy75 ,04/10/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Coming from two BMW's (most recent being a newer model 7 series), I was going back and forth between the X5 and ML. I decided to go with the ML since the value was much greater and I like the ML design better. Also, the standard seats on the X5 were uncomfortable. Although I am accustomed to a smooth ride, I found the ML to drive very well especially considering it's an SUV. I also like how the transmission shifs so smooth.  I bought the ML 350 with premium 2 pkg, parktronic, Ipod and running boards. Unlike the review from spicoli on 3/17/2008, I do have Xenon headlights, rain sensing, power tailgate, driver/passenger memory seats and rear climate control and many other cool features. ","Love the Ipod, smooth transmission, size of vehicle, bluetooth, Satellite the sporty feel & drive. Great price!",Navigation needs updating as grapics are boring but works well. Ipod songs should also be listed on computer screen so you can see more than one line (currently near odometer as one liner) and be able to scroll up & down. 
4.75,Much better than Porsche ,Ultimate Machine ,04/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I purchased the AMG63 for my wife to replace her Porsche Cayanne S. She was hesitant because she really loved her Porsche, but after driving it for few days she fell in love with it.  The ML63 is so much fun to drive that I almost like it more than my CLK AMG convertible. I cannot imagine anyone not liking this SUV. If you have $95,000 to spare there is no better family car to have. I guarantee it.  ","Performance, build quality, AMG styling, better gas mileage than I thought",None
4.875,ML550 Great!,DWK ,03/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased an 06 ML500 to replace my 2001 ML430. Loved it so much I just purchased a 2008 ML550. The motor is fantastic. The 550 is so smooth and fast, it blows away the 500 engine.  Heated and cooled front seats, air suspension, and 19"" AMG rims make the car the ultimate long distance cruiser.  Handles the Canadian winter with no problem, and takes us skiing every weekend in style with heated rear seats for the kids. As my 4th ML since 1999, this one can't be beat. We plan to keep the ML500 and ML550 for a long time.","Heated and cooled seats, multi contour seats, heated steering wheel, air suspension, iPOD connection",None.
4,Not Enough for the Price,spicoli ,03/18/2008,,,4,4,3,4,,5,5,3,4," We were previously dedicated BMW owners however a lack of incentive programs on the new X5's led me to Mercedes. The vehicle we bought is pathetically equipped. We did buy an entry level model (only $46,000). But even at that price one would assume you would get some of the basics. I am very disappointed in the lack of features. Here is a list of what the vehilce does not have that all of my previous BMW's came with as standard:  Xenon headlights Rain sensing windsheild wipers No song/artist title on radio display Power lift gate Child locks on rear doors (believe that one!)

4.875,My first SUV,ajkinpa ,02/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love this car! I recently bought a 2008 Limited Edition M350 and it's the first SUV I've owned, having previously owned 4-door luxury sedans. The car is a vast improvement over previous models. The newly designed exterior is sleek rather than boxy, interior is luxurious yet practical, and handling is responsive but not truck-like. The interior and ride are more like a luxury sedan than a work- horse vehicle, though I got the car to perform in the snow. It hasn't snowed since I got the car so I can't comment on that aspect of its performance, but I'm sure I won't be disappointed since previously I owned a rear-wheel drive car.    ","The comfy supportive heated leather Navigation system, comfy supportive heated leather seats, integrated Bluetooth phone, electronic tailgate, and rain-sensing windshield wipers are favorite features to just name a few.",Gas mileage could be improved.
5,Diesel Power and Sublime Beauty,mbzx ,01/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I purchased a 2008 ML320 CDI with Premium II package in Sept. 2007 although I had been nervous about MB's less than stellar reputation in quality. My car has so far exceeded all my expectation in terms of performance and quality. The tremendous diesel power propels the car into any traffic when needed. But mostly I like driving very gently and the car rewards me with 30 miles on highways (when I am really gentle) and 23 miles in local/highway (40/60) mix on average. Its creature comfort is well designed and well executed. The car feels like a marble rolling on glass pane in highways. I am thoroughly enjoying the car and most probably will purchase GL320 CDI in the near future.,"Very smooth highway riding. Rain-sensing wipers, stereo system, hands-free comm, memory seats, bi-xenon head lamps, cornering lights, power liftgate. Its external design is superb.",COMAND display could be higher resolution and in color. Navigation user interface stinks. Any $250 standalone navigation device would much better with 3D rendering and intuitive design. The car lurches back and forth when breaking. It's not a show stopper but it 's a constant irritation.
3.5,Do not trade your Lexus for it!,Oleg ,01/15/2008,,,1,5,4,3,,5,2,5,3,"I get used to my 2004 Lexus navigation system and now I am not able to find a Starbucks Coffee in LA. According to Mercedes-Benz, the closed Starbucks is in Oregon. The height of the inside mirror is not adjustable and tall people like me will need to lie down on the passenger sit making the right turn. The half of storage compartment is used by the Bluetooth adapter so you can store only a pair of glasses in it. There are hidden costs. After purchasing the vehicle you will discover that you have to pay extra $400 for the Bluetooth adapter (standard with the Lexus navigation system). The car runs smoothly and has a lot of power, but these small things may spoil the fun of driving it.","Appearance, performance, keyless entry.","Improve navigation database, voice commands (check out Lexus or Acura).

5,An excellent SUV combines the goodness,WWW ,01/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I own a Toyota minivan. I have tried Lexus Rx and GX 470, BMW X5, Toyota 4-RUnnner and Highlander hybrids before I settle down to this ML 320 CDI. All the Toyotas and Lexuss have the similar driving trait and characteristic, includ quiet, comfort but boring. BMW is impressive for its road handling and driving capability but it is louder and coarse. Its electronics is too complicated with a lots of trouble. The Mercedes combined all those goodness plus the advantage for fuel economy. So far I got 22-24 MPG combine local and highway in the break in period. The truck is more comfort and quieter than Lexuss and Toyotas. The road handling and drivability is definitely better than Lexus and Toyota","Good fuel economy, a charateristic combining comfort, quiet, handling and off road capability","The seat is not as soft, plush as Toyota or Honda brand, option is cost and expensive, reliability need to be proved"
4.875,Tenth Edition,K.Garnes ,01/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I purchased the ML after trading in the Lincoln Navigator.  I purchased it for my wife who loves the look and comfort of the vehicle.  I like the sound feeling and how easy it drives.  We recently took a short two hour trip and found it to be all we expected and more.  We have previously owned 6 SUV's in the past but this by far is the best SUV we have ever owned.  For that matter it just might be the best vehicle we have ever owned.  I would purchase it again without any reservation.,Comfortable ride and steering feel.,Brakes feel like they come on a little late as you apply steady pressure.

With all the concern about economy and emissions, it seems diesel is better than hybrid and E85, so I wanted a diesel. This car has far surpassed my expectations. I have never found driving more exciting, and I'm still learning about all the little gadgets and conveniences. I leased this one for 33 months, but expect to buy next time.","The attention to detail and convenience. The NAV system is nice as is the stereo.

First, it was louder than I thought it would be, coming from a Toyota it is an adjustment. Second, the shifting is not as smooth as I remember when I test drove but not bad. Having said that, I think the car is superb.  The mileage is pretty good, I have been getting between 19 - 22 in the city so far.  The interior is unbelievable, very posh and comfortable.   The controls are very intuitive which is nice. Put everything on auto and it does the rest.  Rear cameras should be standard on all SUV's, what a great feature!

The transmission provides engine braking automatically.  Air suspension is adaptable and smooth.  I drove up and down snowy, unplowed hilly roads all day yesterday without slips or slides, mostly in the Airmatic raised position.   Surprisingly tight turning radius.

The vehicle has just over 3000 miles and mpg should improve in the next year. There have been no faults large or small found.

Yes, it's a hair louder than a gas engine under acceleration (which is excellent, by the way, because of all that torque).  But cruising is very quiet, and there's absolutely no smoke or odor, ever.   Bottom line: you get the space and utility you need at a thrifty 26 mpg.
