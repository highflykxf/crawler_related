Forget about the chains forever with this car;   Oh, by the way, after 100K, the motor is still super reliable.  I spent $500 on the 100K service and had to spend $600 on the hybrid fan after 60K, but other than that its just a $20 oil change every 5K.

The first winter the wrench light kept coming on disabling traction control. The power steering periodically shuts off, which the manual calls ""normal"". Recently this triangle light has been coming on almost daily which indicates a serious problem with the Hybrid system. The shift had to be replace after something broke inside releasing the car from park, resulting in a co-worker getting run over by the car. The gas/elec transition is rough, and the gas engine is loud. I understand its feet and it'll have problems - but this is ridiculous. ","Great sound system, love the blue lighting. Good size vehicle.

3.125,Not great in a cold climate,EyeOnAlaska ,03/19/2010,,,3,3,3,4,,3,3,3,3,"Bought my used 08 FEH awd for my move back to Alaska.  Very disappointed with the mileage I'm getting in a colder climate-averaging 21mpg all- around.  Granted, that's ok for an SUV, but certainly doesn't live up to its billing.   It very rarely goes into EV mode, and even when it does, the engine won't stay off sitting at a stoplight.  This is in temperatures anytime below 20 F.  Below 0 F, mpg drops into the mid teens and it sounds like a coffee grinder on steroids until it finally warms up.  Almost a must to keep it in a heated garage.  You have to be incredibly careful with the gas pedal to not kick it out of EV mode leaving a stoplight.","Comfortable seats, decent radio, good traction.  Still decent mileage for an AWD SUV.","Interior is cheap, even with leather.  Engine is loud and tinny if you're having to use any power.  Gas pedal is much too touchy for EV mode and I wish it had a switch that would let the driver select EV mode."

Averaging about 28 overall, about 26 highway and 32 around town. If you're coming from a high-powered vehicle, you may not be happy with the slight lag in acceleration when you need to accelerate hard, but that's the only flaw with the system. I have a light foot; it's supposed to learn how you drive, so maybe those with a heavy foot won't have a lag. 100% trouble free, normal maintenance only, which is not expensive.

I like the styling and don't feel I compromised on any factors when I bought it. I have kept a spreadsheet of actual mileage and have maintained an overall 31 mpg. The worst case mileage is log distance highway driving at 70+ mph when my FEH got 28 mpg.

4.375,Pleased with 2008 Escape Hybrid ,George S ,03/18/2009,,,4,4,4,5,,4,5,5,4,"I bought this for the boss to replace a mini-van we outgrew. We wanted to downsize but not give up comfort and the ability to haul stuff from time to time. Oh yes, we wanted to use less gas as well.  The Escape Hybrid did all these things for us. It gets a consistent 30MPG which certainly meets our expectations. We have not had any trouble with it whatsoever. Frankly, I didn't expect it to be this good but Ford, so far, has exceeded my expectations with regard to reliability.  As an engineer, I appreciate and respect this as a technological achievement. The shop manuals for it have been enlightening and entertaining. To the boss it's ""push this to go;  this to stop"". It works for both of us.",Seamless hybrid operation;  comfortable on trips; flat screen display and representation of the power functions; ,"HVAC should be simpler, it appears to have too many confusing functions. I prefer to dial in the temp and let it decide how to achieve same. Use the graphical display to incorporate engine diagnostic functions (i.e. OBDII and Ford specific).

We drove our Escape Hybrid from Spearfish to Rapid City, and we knew that we had made the right decision. My wife says ""It is quiet & relaxing like Grandmom's Studebaker"".","The automatic lights on, for night time illumination. The automatic transmission with seamless shift changes. Lots of head room. It's a friendly, economic, and fun SUV","Our plan was to get an electric vehicle that does not kick in the engine until over 30 to 35 mph, you know, around town driving speed.  There are other vehicles out there that can do this.  Higher electric speed can be more effecient. The hood design could be flatter from the drivers perspective."
4.625,Traded Hummer H2 SUT and Very Happy!,Craig Y in Dallas ,01/03/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,4,4,5,5,"When I bought my FEH in May 2007, I was looking for a more economical replacement for my Hummer H2 that I absolutely loved, that is until I had to feed it!  I was spending $600 - $900 per month on fuel and could no longer justify that expense. I did not want to buy the 4WD FEH initially until I could determine whether I could be happy in the pint sized replacement.  I purchased the 2008 FEH FWD and to my absolute amazement, it surpassed my expectations in every way!  It not only delivers 2.5 to 3 times the gas milease I was getting in my H2 but it had more cargo space and great acceleration. From my home in Dallas, I regularly get 32 - 37 MPG driving to and from Austin.","Comfortable seats, DVD navigation with 1 DVD for entire U.S and Canada, and Sirius XM satellite radio!","More optional equipment for the Hybrid. Not all optional equipment for non-hybrid Escape will work with FEH.  Specifically, I wanted integrated Bluetooth kit and Homelink (garage door opener) rear view mirror.

I wanted something that we could take camping and that would be safe/comfortable to travel in but that would get good fuel economy in the city. I have not been disappointed with my choice! The car is easy to drive. Since it is a hybrid that depends on braking to recharge the battery, it tends to get better gas mileage with long, slow stops (at least that's what I've noticed).  I thought that going from a V8 to the hybrid would be a shock, but this vehicle really has some get-up-n- go. The seats are easy to move and clean, and I've never had any engine trouble.","I got a package that included heated seats, which are a very nice addition. I also like the cloth cover that can be extended over the trunk area for privacy. The extra weight of the second battery also provides some extra stability.","I do wish that we would have been able to put a tow hook on it, which I have seen on non-hybrid Escapes.

It has plenty of power and yet it gets good mileage. I get about 6.7 lt/100 KM in a small town and 7.1 on the highway. It is quiet in electric drive (stealth mode). We bought an upscale model with most of the toys including the AWD. The ease of getting in/out is also a plus. The front leather seats are very comfortable. Interior lighting gives it a classy look at night. The ownership, to date, has been a pleasure. It is a bit disconcerting at first when the engine shuts down in traffic. I don't mind when the ECON switch (on) shuts down the AC in traffic (I can take a litle heat) I just thnk about the gas.",Comfort of ride. The important controls are easy to reach. The seats are firm yet comfortable. The heated seats work well and very quickly. Lots of storage when the seats are down. Fit and finish are good. Got to love the hybrid best of all. Not too much of a complaint here. Ford got the SUV right.,More colour choices. I wish it had stability control on the '08. Seat belts in back are difficult to get into. Laying down of the seats is a hassle. The NAV system could include a better terrain view. Ford should give a more recent map CD. A rub strip on the side is needed. Get rid of the hood prop.

Gas prices were part of my decision, and I honestly wanted to be one of the voices clamoring for Detroit to get with the program and invest in alternative powertrains. I loved the build quality and engineering excellence of the BMW. I expected that switching to a more pedestrian Ford was going to be full of compromise. Certainly, the finishes are less luxurious (recycled plastic instead of leather dash, fewer adjustments in the seating, etc), but overall, I have been quite satisfied. If I had it to do all over again, I would do it all over again.  ","Zippy, great nav system, good leather seats, decent stereo, consistent 30 MPG.","Why no E85? This should be easy!

The leather is a little stiff and I have a rattle in the center console where it meets the dash.

In New England the weather is so variable by season that I actually charted my mileage for each fill up. In winter months with heat and electric seat heaters I could get 22 - 24 mpg. In the spring I shot back up to 30 mpg. Max mileage reached was 31.5 and that was only 3 times. The economy mode button helps by cutting out the engine at traffic lights so blowers will still work but not AC or heat.  That's ok for short pauses. The one thing inconsistent is the HEV or hybrid display of mileage - it is always higher than reality by 1.5 - 2.5 miles. ,"Hybrid - why else buy it, right? Navigation, upgraded stereo, handling, mileage for a 4 wheel drive, albeit all wheel drive vehicle. Pickup from stop for such a small motor/hybrid vehicle. I can pull away from a light on battery if I want or step on it in a hurry.","Cargo space. The Sable wagon has more! H/L 4 wheel drive and a 2 wheel/4 wheel option. That would improve mileage. Worst feature is the warranty. Better battery life for running on motor only. Ford still has 3 year warranty for this vehicle. Sad, very sad. Hybrid battery has 8 year."

We have had no problems with it of any sort. I had a good test of the AWD last winter when traveling a lonely state highway in a full-on snowstorm. There was 3-4 inches of snow on the road and the Escape handled it beautifully. The Highway Partol closed the road right after I made it through due to other vehicles involved in accidents. Our milage is a very consistent 27 to 28 MPG, whether city or highway.  In very hot weather the city mileage drops if the A/C can't be kept in the ""economy"" mode. If the A/C is not in ""economy"" the gas motor runs all the time.  Great car!  Buy it if you can find one!","Hybrid feature works great.  Excellent gas mileage in stop and go traffic. Lots of interior room. Very good comfort.

The fit and finish have been great and it just right for both my 4' 11"" wife and my 6'2"" self. I live in Colorado, it has done very well in the mountains and the power of the 133 HP 4 cylinder backed up by the electric motor is equivalent to the V6 gas Escape I have.

Although there were no observable problems, they had to replace cooling fans, motors, etc.  I suspect the system detects potential problems quickly. I get around 37MPG in winter, and 33MPG in summer (with AC running most of the time (Tucson, AZ)). There's a squeak sound coming from a motor somewhere.

If only it had stearing wheel controls for the radio and navigation system. It is somewhat distracting to take your eyes off the road to change radio stations, or enter a new destination on the nav system. Other than that the Escape is a great vehicle. Leather seats are comfortable, and the interior is very well dressed up. Rear seats fold nicely flat. Plenty of room for 4 people and luggage for a week in the rear. Tires are quite and smooth, but the continental tires are not good in the winter. Goodyear tires would be a much better choice.","The navigation system is large and full of information. Not a small 4.3"" like the aftermarket units. But the gas mileage is my favorite. Even with the four wheel drive version I am often averaging in excess of 30 miles per gallon which is more than the vehicle is rated at.","Steering wheel controls for the radio are desperately needed, along with 8 way memory adjustable drivers seat.

I am not sure it was worth it - I think you give up quality in other areas. I will have to say that the quality is no where near as nice as the Expedition I had prior. Some of the interior and exterior portions of the car are cheap plastic and scratch very easy.   have a fully loaded model except for the navigation system. I am getting about 25 miles to the gallon but if you like to stay cool during the summer months forget driving in electric mode - the one thing they don't tell you is you won't go electic with the AC on even in econ mode!,The car comes with a backing up indicator that is great - if you use it you should never back up into anything again! And the split fold down seats are a must in this car!,"1) Re-design the way to fold down the back seats, way too many steps to be efficient. 2) add hanger for cloths - there is only one at the back left side which blocks your vision.

Technique definitely matters - no jackrabbit starts, coast as much as possible, avoid excessive speed and you'll see 32-33 mpg without a problem.  I live in South FL and so far, no problems with the a/c on economy mode; car stays cool with the fan & recirc. air.  I did a lot of research before buying.

The one thing that I don't think was engineered well is the rear hatch and glass. It rattles and is not sound proofed well at all. Also, the door windows could have used better guides - they rattle in the door when you close it if they are not rolled all the way up. Other than those two minor gropes, this vehicle is designed well and built with quality workmanship. I would definitely buy it again.","6 cd MP3 system 110 volt outlet in front for household current - laptops, dvd players, charging cameras & camcorders. Styling - bold and aggressive.

I have read a lot of reviews, and knew to wait until after 1000 miles to check MPG. Also, have read enough to know that cold weather drops MPG, but that is the cost of living someplace cold. I set the cruise on my 35 minute highway drive to work at 70 for the first month and averaged 32.5 MPG.  Second month I set the cruise at 65 and it jumped to 34.5. Add in the city driving and I get around 35.5.  I had to rush home one day, and it really does move like a V-6 when you stomp on it.  I rode in a 2006 a few times before, and again after, buying mine, and the 2008 is quiet. Engine rev noise only when it is working real hard","MPG great. Heated seats, awesome. Nav system worth the extra money. I got mine loaded, and love every option.

I chose fwd to save fuel, slipped all the time in the least amount of snow, got stuck twice in snow when other fwd cars drove by me. Then I read it has no traction control! The heavy battery in back throws off the weight balance advantage of fwd.  Very frustrating experience! You in cold weather states need to beware!

From the other reviews, this is very low.  I have a friend with a 2006 that gets over 30, has from the beginning.  I don't know if I have a ""lemon"", but Ford will not even hear about mileage issues until 10,000 miles.  Even though 25 is good for a SUV, it's not that much more than my Explorer.  And I'm driving very conscientously. I recently drove a rented Charger, that got this mileage!  ","Enjoy all of the ""bells and whistles"" that did not have on Explorer.  Very smooth ride, and quiet.  Handles well, fun to drive. ","Wish more color choices, ""Auto"" headlights do not come on soon enough when getting dark.  Better design of front plate mount.

The items that are noted as cons in the Edmunds review do hold true, but are not that big of deal in looking at the vehicle overall. I think the Escape handles well for an SUV and I enjoy driving it.  The interior is nice and the cab is fairly quiet except when the engine is excellerating.  I have only filled the tank on this vehicle 3 times so far.  The first time I got 26mpg and the last two times I got 30mpg.  This is a combo of freeway and city driving.  I even drove it up the steep hills of San Francisco with three adults in it and still got 30mpg with good power. ","Handles well for a Ford SUV.  Have driven other Ford SUV's that do not handle well at all.  This one does. Stock sound system is decent, but if you are used to an aftermarket system, you'll want to upgrade.  I like the clean lines in the interior and the cab seems pretty quiet. ","Decrease engine noise when excellerating, add daytime running lights,  radio controls do not stay illuminated with lights off when in accessory key position. This vehicle is great for the price.

The car was very comfortable for the entire trip and averaged 38 MPG.","Economy, comfort, ease of parking, maneuverability, audio (bought the Nav system with the high end audio), appearance, price ($27,700 total), and very low emissions. The material for the seats is very good, and is 100% recycled material.","I would like to see the backup sensors made standard on all Escapes, and would like to see the stability control which is standard on the other Escape models added to the Hybrid, though with the extra weight of the battery pack in the rear it may not be needed."
5,Go For It,David ,07/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We are very discerning car buyers. We have bought three new BMWs in the last 10 years, have had two Chevy Suburbans, and own a brand new Range Rover. We shopped for a hybrid partly because we were feeling guilty, and have no affection for Japanese cars. The Ford Escape Hybrid is, without a question, a neat little vehicle. Both my wife and I are both enjoying it greatly. Does it have the finish of a Range Rover?  No, but it also costs about $50,000 less and it uses a lot less gas. The Escape has a lot of pep. It darts around town as well as any car. And all the while, we feel a little less guilty using it than we do when we are using our other cars.","We love the Hybrid version used by Ford. It runs either electric or gas, but not both at the same time. The GM version runs both electric and gas simultaneously.  Very solid feel.","The only improvements we would suggest would regard the plastic finish levels on the door pockets and on the trim around the door jambs which overlay the carpets - this could be tighter, and be done with a higher quality/more durable material.

5,Bye Bye Car!,Bye Bye Car! ,06/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I replaced my 1995 Honda Civic with the 2008 Escape Hybrid.  I thought I liked my car, but driving the Escape, I don't think I will ever go back to a car!  The Escape Hybrid has more get- up-and-go than a regular 4 cylinder.  The added oomph from the battery really helps acceleration!  I am getting about 31 mpg freeway/city driving.  The transition was seamless, but the more I drive the Escape, I can tell when it switches, although I sometimes think I am more in tune with a vehicle than other. The Escape fits my 6'4"" husband comfortably (unlike the Honda), and the two kids have plenty of room in the back.","Sunroof, 6 months free Sirius, power everything, unbelieveably quiet on the road, roomy, one touch open on the sunroof",One Touch close on the sunroof. The headrest metal supports have no padding on the back of the front seats. I can see in the future holes wearing through the back of the seats. More padding there? Maybe move the A/C and fan buttons?  I seem to hit them quite often shifting into park.  
5,Great car!,jmd ,06/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I've only had my '08 Hybrid Escape for 3 weeks but so far it has been great. I'm getting better than average mileage and have no complaints. It is fun to drive and easy to manuever in DC traffic. I traded in an '06 Honda Odyssey due to terrible gas mileage. Nothing but positives so far.,Fuel mileage. MP3 and regular electric outlet. Quiet ride. Great visability. I especially like the exterior mirrors. Flip top glass on hatchback,Audio controls on steering wheel. Sirius radio without getting the moonroof

First tank I got 32.34mpg (AWD). This is a combination of highway/city. The digital readout for mpg does read low as another reviewer mentioned. It is very quiet in town and reasonable at highway speed. It is no tire burner but acceleration is acceptable. Stock sound system is good, climate control works well. It also makes me feel I am doing my part to reduce greenhouse emmissions. ","Great mileage for an AWD SUV, quietness, low emissions. Appearance is nice, overall fit and finish is good. I also like the safety features provided by the multiple airbag systems.","Interior could be brightened up a bit... very dull and plastic.

I really like the Audiophile sound system, satellite radio and moonroof. I am getting about 29 mpg in mostly highway driving.  I had a 2001 Escape that I liked until the transmission went out on it.  I hope this one is more reliable.  Only time will tell.","The Audiophile sound system, satellite radio, moonroof, AC outlet, quiet ride and gas mileage.",Put sound system controls on steering wheel.

4.875,2008 Escape Hybrid AWD w/ Premium Package,TahoeJimRocks ,05/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Had the Escape for 2 months with 2K miles on it. Mileage is excellent 25.5mpg lowest during break in, highest 36.6 on 300 mile trip. Very short hops kill your mileage (less than 5 mi). Nav system is easy to use. GPS is very accurate. Audiophile sound system is great. Side step rails are no assistance getting in the car because there is no grab handles in the interior. Very comfortable leather seats - seat warmers are a must in cold climate. 110 AC plug is great - no power adapter needed for iPod, finally an audio jack in dash. Usual wind noise with moon roof. Since batteries are in real storage area under deck there is a lack of storage. Roof side rails are plastic and flimsy.  ","Mileage, instrument layout, nav and audio sys, comfortable seats with good head room, all disc brakes, solid handling. Love the new ice blue color, does not show dust. Good power going up steep slopes at freeway speed. After 1st oil change then change every 10K ","Poor acceleration at 40 mph up steep slopes, lack of interior storage, no engine temp gauge, difficult to adjust electric seat once door is close - tight fit for arm between seat and door, must remove rear head rests to fold down rear seats, lack of stability sys, no vol controls on steering wheel."
5,Loving it.,TM ,05/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have never been a Ford fan until now. Sold my VW Golf TDI, bought this vehicle 4 weeks ago and totally love it. We took it on a 4800 mile road trip for 2 weeks and it performed beautifully. We drove through many 11,000ft+ mountain passes, passed trucks and had plenty of power to spare. The low gear was a huge benefit on the mountain descents. The handling is responsive and it feels solid on the road. Ride is smooth and it absorbs the road better than I expected. For our trip we averaged 31mpg. Not bad at all. I do find my ""in town"" driving milage a little lower since most roads in my area aren't flat. I average 28mpg in town. The pop up back glass is very helpful when traveling with a dog.","Love the aux input for my i-pod and AC plug in (battery chargers for cameras, laptop, phones, i-pod). Display is easy to read and location is helpful up on the dash. The center console is huge. Great layout and storage. Seats are very comfortable. Lots of cabin room. Sharp styling.",The headrests. I find they angle forward too much and they unfortunately don't rotate for adjustment. I've had to turn the head rests around backwards. It looks a little funny but works better for me. Wish the glove box was a tad larger. It is so small.
5,2008 Escape My Experience,Tim Weisert ,05/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The ride is smoother than I expected. The continously variable transmission is great. Transitions from electric to gas and gas to electric are almost not perceived. If it fits in your budget the luxury package is great especially the display features.,Display for navigation. Monitor for instantaneous and average gas mileage. Moon roof is nice.,
5,Driving is fun again!,Grace ,05/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had my hybrid for a little over 3 weeks now.  I had been wanting to get one since I first heard about hybrids. I'm so glad I finally did! The Escape is fantastic and has everything I could possibly want in a vehicle. I think it is a great product! I feel like I did when I first got my driver's license years ago: want to drive, drive, drive! Everyone I show it to is amazed and pleasantly surprised. I realize it may be too soon to give a proper evaluation, but I am truly in love with this vehicle so far!","Moon roof, information displays, quiet, smooth ride, fun-to-drive factor, environmentally friendly.",Can't think of any!
5,Great improvement,Mike ,05/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I had a 2004 Ford Escape, the new 2008 Hybrid out performs the V6 in my 2004 model.  My first week I averaged 29MPG. They reprogramed the computer that operates the Hybrid and this corrects all the the flaws in the older models.",The new design is great. The cabin noise level is much improved over the 2004. I drove the Camrey Hybrid and the Escape was just as quiet.,None
5,I love my Ford Escape Hybird,rm ,04/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased the vehicle 3 weeks ago. It's great. We get an average of 32.5 mpg. The reader estimates the mpg on the low side (usually, 30 or 30.5), however, measuring the amount of gas used fuel economy is about 32-33mpg. ",I like the look of the car and the fuel economy is great. ,
5,Excellent Value,Robby K. ,04/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am so impressed with my new Hybrid. It gets great gas mileage and provides a smooth quiet comfortable ride. I like the eye level informaiton display which makes it easier to focus on the road. I also find the convenience of the mp3 player hook up and power outlet a huge bonus. The Escape is not only a great value, it is fun to drive and saves the environment. I am so glad Ford made this very luxury affordable.","My favorite features are the quiet sounding motor, easy to use control panel in the interior and the overall exterior styling.",The only improvement is maybe having a full sized spare tire.
4.75,Very nice overall - mileage isn't great,TJ ,04/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"For an AWD vehicle, gas mileage is good. However, it is not going to blow you away, especially when you compare it to hybrid sedans. I am averaging 27- 29.5 mpg mixed city/highway driving after 2 tanks. Going 75 on the hwy = 23mpg. AWD works well. I felt no slippage during the most recent snow.  Performance is smooth for an SUV. I can't burn off the line, but it is a hybrid and that is to be expected. Navigation package is great and worth it if you hate getting lost and arguing of directions.  Audiophile Sound system is good quality. Standard recycled premium seat fabric is good quality. Dash and doors are plastic, though they do appear to be sturdy and thick.","Navigation package, high seats, and AWD.","Improve gas mileage. The Highlander hybrid gets better mileage and supposedly has better performance. If performance is going to be less, why can't the Escape at least match the gas mileage?  A plug in lithium ion battery would help differentiate it."
5,Glad to go green,thor59 ,04/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Traded in a 2005 Turbo Diesel for the Hybrid. Best decision I've made in a long time. Actually got 41 miles to the gallon in the city yesterday. Quite a difference from fifteen. I'll never buy anything but a hybrid again. Love the Ford, totally impressed, get one.","Love the moonroof, Sirius radio, and fuel economy. Unbelievable!",Keep building 'em.
5,Impressed with our new hybrid,zeeman84 ,04/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"So far the experience has been positive. Traded a 2005 Escape which had served us very well.  Average MPG with about 50% highway and 50% city driving has been 31mpg.  Very quite, handles well, interior layout is great. Very happy with this purchase.

4.375,Escape Hybrid hits the mark,Kpick ,04/03/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,5,5,I picked up my 2008 Escape Hybrid one week ago. First impressions are excellent. Gas mileage is 36 mpg in mostly city driving. The leather interior is well done. The build quality is flawless. I traded a 2005 Honda Accord because I needed more interior room and better gas mileage. The Escape gave me both. Time will tell if the reliability will match Honda.,"The city gas mileage is surprisingly high so far, surpassing the estimates. The gas mileage graph showing 15 minutes of MPG in one minute increments is a spectacular aid to maximizing the MPG.",The Nav DVD is woefully lacking in detail. Nearly every road off the main streets causes a 'not enough detail' voice message and a stop to voice guidance.  Ford should ask Garmin how to implement a Nav system. Put the grab handles back.  Put audio controls on the steering wheel and add an equalizer.
5,Good job,Richard ,03/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is the first new Ford I purchased in 29 years. I traded in a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee. In fact the last 5 new SUV's I purchased were Jeep Grand Cherokees. After 2 years of driving the 2005 Jeep I had enough of the poor service and lack of concern by Jeep. I was hesitant to purchase and did quite a bit of research before doing so and glad I did. The Escape Hybrid is fun to drive, has better visibility, and the gas mileage is twice that of the Jeep! We did drive the Toyota Highlander Hybrid and the bottom line was about the same but I am tall enough that when getting in and out of the Toyota I scraped my head, this is not the case with the Ford. Also, GM has nothing to offer in hybrids.","Since we have to other 4-wheel drive SUV's we purchased the Escape Hybrid with FWD, but we purchased every option available including the navigation system. We did not have a navigation system of the last Jeep and the system is costly but worth the money.",I really like everything about the Escape although I must admit the only down side is that it is not as roomy as the Jeep. It would be nice if Ford could add the Hybrid to the Explorer as I will be interested in purchasing another this year.
4.75,Mean Green Machine,David ,03/23/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,5,5,"Just purchased this vehicle after owning 03 Escape v6.  Ford did a really nice job on the interior/exterior redesign.  Smooth, comfortable ride, great visibility.  Only complaints I would voice is that there is an image of the light colored dash board reflected onto the windshield via glare in direct sunlight...strange thing indeed...perhaps tinting or some type of dash cover is the solution to that one.  Also, Bluetooth absent on a very expensive (but nice) Nav system.",Visibility and seating position. Comparable to V6 performance. MPG and friendlier to the environment. Very spacious and comfortable interior with lots of storage space for stuff.,Dashboard shouldn't glare onto windshield in sunny conditions.  Bluetooth should be included with Nav.
3.125,Why did they scew up th enterior,Seadog9 ,03/19/2007,,,1,4,3,3,,4,3,4,3,"I replaced my 3 year old Escape with the 08 Hybrid. I immediately was disappointed with the interior changes. The heated seat button is on the side of the seat where you can't see it. You have to feel for it. The took out many of the little storage places and the center console/arm rest is hard to open when driving. The gas mileage is good, not great but good and it is a little quieter inside on the highway than my old one. I am very disappointed over all.","Quiet, better gas mileage.","iPod AUX plug, move heated seat button to the dash. Move center console forward so you can open it easier. Put back the little storage slots the old escape had."
4.375,2008 Escape Hybrid Impression,Terry ,03/15/2007,,,5,4,4,4,,5,4,5,4,"I took another look at the Escape Hybrid because it is supposed to be improved in many ways, ride/handling in particular. Those factors, and the relatively cheap feel of the interior for the price, is why I didn't get one before. My impressions after a couple of weeks with my new 2008 are positive. It's much quieter. The handling, while still somewhat truck-like, is better sorted than the prior model. It's reasonably roomy and practical and gets great mileage. I was skeptical at first, but it really is a Have Your Cake and Eat It Too sort of vehicle.","Size is just right, IMO. Audiophile sound is good, seats good, ride/handling improved, and they kept the weight down. Definitely has SUV feel, if that's what you want. Hybrid drivetrain is well done and makes more sense than V-6 & high price of Highlander. Near carbon neutral & made in Kansas City!","Need better folding rear seat to be competitive. Where's the steering-wheel audio/climate control? A capable roof rack is important to many of us; this one is weak.  Numerous touch items (door handles, glovebox etc) are too cheap-o. Quality is improved but still too cheap vs competitors."
4.5,2008 Escape,drdan3 ,03/08/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I have had the '08 Escape for over two weeks now.  Cons: *Body style very trucky - personal opinion but trying to emulate Explorers isn't a selling point for me.  The windshield (and entire front end) could be swept back - perhaps improving the aerodynamics and MPG.  *Interior - climate control buttons are confusing.  Recirculate gets disconnected when using 'footwarming' vents; seems to have a mind of its own.  Also the buttons are very small, should have stuck with rotary dial  * No grab handles - curtain airbags seems to have made them disappear - no where to hang my dry cleaning  * No Bluetooth available - I bought a TomTom 910 for both Bluetooth & GPS. ","Pros: *Relatively quiet ride, although wind noise is apparent, esp. noisy moonroof (when tilted). *Very comfortable seats, with drivers being powered with vertical height adjustment (premium package leather). *Handling is quite good for SUV. *Fuel economy. *Good stock radio. *Great auto headlight.",*Some redesign of climate control buttons making them bigger or using rotary dial. *Find a way of reinvoking the grab bars. * Incorporate Bluetooth into nav kit - might have paid closer to the absurd $2695 for that option (Sync seems like a complicated way to solve a simple problem!).
