We get about 11.5 MPG around town.",The interior and dash are great and the exterior has the real truck look!,Fuel consumption should be improved!
4.5,First Pick Up,Salvatore ,08/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"Said I would never own a pickup. Seems to be a very very nice tow vehicle. Perhaps one of the very few that doesn't wear on you when travelling long distance. Fit and quality seem excllent. Brakes and wheels are awesome. Mileage is 12-13 around town, 15-16 on the interstate, and 10-12 when towing a 10,000lb Airstream. As long as you remember its intended purpose, you'll love the truck. I had zero problems so far, and have 7200 miles on it. I highly recommend this tow vehicle.",Ordered with all options except navigation. Opted for manual shift 4 wheel drive. Kingranch option.,Would like firmer upshift for the automatic transmission. Everything else seems well designed.
3.125,Mixed Blessing,West Coast Morgans ,07/05/2007,,,4,5,1,3,,2,5,2,3,"Most everything about the truck is great. However the engine makes strange noises, and Ford neglets to tell future owners the engine is goverened between 80 and 85 mph",Trailer tow. ,Get rid of the governer. 
4.25,F-450,blackhawk ,05/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,2,4,"After owning 4 GMT800 duallys and after researching the new GMT900 dually, I made the switch to Ford. Solid front axle, truck like dash, and heavy duty frame and components instead of GM's IFS were key to my decision. Not to mention a host of other nice features. GM's new lineup have left a lot of customers like myself out in the cold and they will switch to Ford like I did. This truck is solid, rides better than my '05 3500 4x4 GM dually. It gets more looks and thumbs up than my H2. I just have to get used to the solid front axle bump steer, unlike the bolted to the road GM IFS. To sum it up, if you want a commercial grade tow vehicle with Cadillac features, this truck is for you.  ",Nav system and satellite radio. Adjustable pedals. Factory 19.5 chrome semi wheels and tires. This truck has it all factory stock. ,"Make air ride an option. Other than that, good job Ford! "
4.75,Tow Boss,Chis ,05/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Amazing Truck. Moved up from an '03 F-350 w/ v10 auto. Interior looks like something from a luxury car. Smooth ride, ultra quiet, motor has plenty of power to move this 8300 lb. truck. Yea it costs a pretty penny, but well worth it if you need a truck that will tow.  Only buy this thing if you need to tow more than 8 tons, it's a luxury work truck and not a hybrid.","Interior, quiet, powerful motor, twin turbos, tailgate step, avaliable with tons of options.","Mileage, but it's geared as a tow vehicle. 15 mpg is good for a 8300lb. truck. Wish the 7.3 motor could come back but the 6.4 seems like it can do the job I need."
4.375,Early F-450 Review,horse56 ,03/20/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"First impression...900 miles.  For a very large pickup, drives and handles great.  King Ranch package definitely worth it...very lush! Navigation system quite complex, but user friendly. Expect mileage to be 10-15 mpg, once broken in.  Great performance while handling 15,000# trailer...awesome tires and brakes!",Leather. Sound system. Stability.,"Mileage could be better, even in 8,300# truck.  Engine compartment too cramped."
4.875,Early F-450 Review,horse56 ,03/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"First few days of ownership. Overall fit and finish: excellent.  Rides amazingly well even without load. Super-quiet, comfortable interior (King Ranch).  Complicated, but very capable nav system.  A dream to drive with great acceleration (for an 8700# truck), excellent cornering (incredible turn radius).  Prefer over the Duramax GMC.","Incredible payload handling. Bold styling. Well-made, quiet, with no rattles.  WONDERFUL sound system. ",Larger engine compartment to avoid pulling cab for maintenance.
