4,Warm Slippers,Rimantas Aukstuolis ,10/09/2015,5,4,4,,,4,4,3,5,,,"We bought the car new in 2008 and now have 111,000 miles. Normal maintenance, replaced part of exhaust system. Otherwise totally reliable.The ""expert"" review is critical of the ride smoothness. Let me be clear. This is the most comfortable riding car I have ever owned in over 40 years of car ownership. I attribute it to the French, Renault heritage of the chassis platform. If I have a criticism of the suspension it may be that the smoothness of the ride does sacrifice some handling characteristics in that it is not nearly as sure footed as my Honda Civic or Subaru Legacy (rock solid). Build quality appears cheap but is functional and durable. Exterior I believe is classic. Smooth lines. Subsequent model years have messed up a fundamentally clean style. Interior is nothing fancy but comfortable seats, roomy with well placed controls. We bought a hybrid Honda Civic the same time we bought the Sentra for about $8,000 more. Honda was built better with higher quality components, inside and out and better gas milage but we sold the Honda and kept the Sentra for ""around town"" transport. It's just more comfortable, easier access, more capacity and almost as reliable and trouble free. Like an old pair of well worn slippers. Update: April 2016- still going strong at 115,000 miles. No issues. Great for around town. Maybe I'm too conservative but it probably is still OK even for long trips.An additional thought. I have experienced relatively poor handling in snow despite using winter tires. A tire store (which has also done repairs and has an incentive to find things wrong) did note an alignment problem in the back end which they said could be fixed with shims but the process of fixing it could rapidly escalate if they broke any of the fittings which were corroded. I opted not to fix and drive on, being careful in snow (with winter tires) and not noticing any appreciable, unusual tire wear. I mention this as there have been other postings which refer to the same alignment problem.At October 2016, 119000 miles still going strong. Headlight burned out and I had garage replace all front lights because change meant removing headlight assembly, not just twisting out a socket as on other cars. Also developed hole in exhaust ahead of catalytic converter. Garage rewelded and saved me $1900 for new converter. My old Honda had stainless exhaust which is significant. Passenger side auto door lock now buzzes when I unlock. Annoying. It will fail at some point. Repair isn't worth it as it would require disassembly of inside door panel.",,

Rocket launch acceleration is not in this cars DNA, but hyper milling is the order of the day, every day, and that's how I drive it, it makes me feel like ""Cool Hand Luke"". Car has been very dependable and very predictable,which is good! One Big Secret to NISSANS is; any CVT Nissan produced from 03-10 has a 10 year, 120,000 mile warranty on the transmission (I called Nissan direct and they read the memo to me over the phone...twice). They had some bad CVT parts out there and wanted to cover their bases! Well done Nissan. I would like to see some better sheet metal designs come out of Nissan, hopefully Carlos will do that (CEO of Nissan).

I love the smooth CVT with no shift points, the engine power won't win any drag races but gets the job done. I have taken the Sentra on several West Coast road trips over mountain passes and even fully loaded we make it thru just fine.

It's a great car, gets good gas mileage on the highway and I have not had problems with an ""uncomfortable ride"" I only recently replaced my tires & brake pads but the car has 70,000+ miles on it now.

I drive 120 miles daily on straight, flat, highways and the best I have ever gotten was 32 MPG.  I did better than that with my Accord which was bigger and more powerful, and far better than that with my Civic.

4.375,My first Nissan,tishpit ,11/04/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,2,"I've had the car nearly one month and put on over 1800 miles.  Mileage is very good with an average of 30.8 mpg in mixed city and highway driving.  Rides nice, CVT is very smooth and idles so quietly, at first I thought it stalled!  Nice car overall, but not an exciting drive, but then it's not meant to be. Does everything well enough.  Only gripes so far is the driver's side sun visor hits the rear view mirror and therefore makes looking out very difficult unless you duck under it or keep moving the mirror out of the way. Wish it had a trunk release on the fob like my Jeep does. Good quality construction, but beware of blind spots with small, oddly shaped outside mirrors. ","CVT, gas mileage, reliable, quiet engine, good fit and finish.","Larger side mirrors, sun visor that does not hit rear view mirror, lumbar support and slightly firmer seats."
5,Love it!!,Linda ,11/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We test drove the Versa,Cobalt, Caliber, Yaris, Elantra, M3, and the Saturn equivalent. Versa drove the best but was just a tad too small. Then I said, let's try the Sentra! WOW! I knew right away that was the car. Great pickup, GREAT MPG (32 overall, sometimes 37 on the highway). Last weekend was the real test - we got a 9X12 carpet in and closed the trunk! Love those fold down seats!","Fold down seats, radio controls on the steering wheel. ",Make it in bright red! 
3.125,"Reliable Engine, Some Quality Issues.... ",Jeff ,11/02/2008,,,2,4,3,4,,3,4,3,2,I have had my Sentra for about 3 months In the 3 months I have had this car there have been some quality issues both mechanically and build quality Mechanically the engine is very reliable but I will advise you there is a recall on the brakes and most 2008 Sentras have this problem if you take it to Nissan they will fix it free of charge under the warranty. Also the CVT is reliable and smooth but it does make a droning sound when windows are down and does lack on acceleration when not really pushing the car. As for build quality I have to say the exterior is well made but avoid the beige interior it scratches very easily and get very dirty. Overall average car at a average value.,"Auxiliary input jack, power windows and locks, comfortable and rather large cabin for a compact car in its class. Decent value overall.","Only average gas mileage averaging about 22 to 23 MPG with 90 percent city and I am not an aggressive driver, CVT makes a droning sound and definitely not a fan of its performance. Interior build quality feels cheap and beige interior scratches and gets dirty much faster than other cars."
4.75,Excellent car for the price,JordanCS ,10/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"This Sentra replaced my Honda Civic Hybrid (too expensive to keep when I switched jobs and started driving 15 miles a day.)  The Sentra is a great performer... nice acceleration, comfortable ride, though the suspension is a bit stiff.  Interior comfort is excellent.  I feel like I have plenty of room, and I'm a large guy.  Fuel economy has been excellent - getting 35 MPG highway, and about 26 in the city. Great trunk design.  Controls are easy to use and well placed.  Seats are comfortable.  The only nitpick is the lack of two power outlets, which I understand they fixed in the 2009 version.  Great car for the price!",Well laid out interior.  Responsive vehicle to drive.  6 speed manual transmission is great fun.  ,"Two power outlets up front.  Reposition aux input from center of radio to a lower position.  Stiffness of suspension can be uncomfortable at slow speeds on bumpy roads, but is great at normal speeds or on any normal surface."
4.75,Reliable,Ally ,10/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"When my parents and I started looking at cars I hated the Sentra it just wasn't what I thought I was looking for but then I test drove the Civic, Yaris, Corolla and Rabbit and  finally under the encouragement of my father went to a Nissan dealership and I fell in love with the Sentra 2.0S. The keyless entry feature is great I haven't used my key since i left the dealership. It has a smooth look, all the bells and whistles I could ever want all under 20K. Gas is great and even better since the price is starting to drop. The acceleration is good  and despite what other reviewers say I have virtually no outside noise.","Nice handling and acceleration, Keyless entry is fabulous, Gas is great, Brakes are good, the bluetooth is more than i could ask for.",I would've gone with the SL if the leather seats came with a heat option and the truck sits very high so I have to count a lot more on my side and rear view mirror than I would like to. Other than that not bad Nissan.
4,Recall -check out brake fluid,Thomas ,10/21/2008,,,3,4,4,3,,4,5,4,5,I have only 1600 miles on my car and already the brake light warning showing on the dashboard. I check the brake fluid level and it was very low. I topped the liquid level myself and after a week the level has dropped again. Be careful and take this urgent. I am taking the vehicle to the service tomorrow for checkup. I am sure the brake fluid is leaking and the master cylinder will need to be replaced.,"Great gas mileage averaged, driver seat has height adjustment, lots of room.",Trunk release on keyless entry key will be great.
4.875,Very Impressed,Mark ,10/18/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I will say that I looked at the Honda Civic and the Toyota Corolla.  The Sentra was levels above on both.  The Sentra with the CVT made the deal even better.  Overall the Sentra had a great feel and value as well as great fuel economy.,CVT is amazing. The auxiliary port I love that being able to just connect my iPod. Also standard power windows and locks are nice. Not to mention the drive is very smooth and quiet.,"Really, I wouldn't improve too much.  Very well built vehicle and smooth to drive."
4.375,Excellent buy,CTM ,10/05/2008,,,1,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"Wondering about MPG? If I keep my foot out of it I can average 30 mpg. Usual avg is 27. I get 36 mpg hwy in 6th going 55-60 mph. It can run on regular, no problems, but I use premium for more power.  I installed an Injen CAI and it SIGNIFICANTLY made more power. Worth every penny and with about 3 months of use no problems.  The seats are very comfortable on long trips. The trunk is huge. The glove box is huge. I outrun CooperS, GTI, VR6 no problems.  The affordable price is great. Not as fast as a Speed3 but it costs $5-$6k less.  Avoid the Rockford stereo. It sounds good when not moving. But roll windows down and it is easily drowned out. Tires are great dry, bad in snow.","Shifter location, black interior, head room, hip room, seats are great, subdued exterior look-- no big spoilers or hood scoops. Size of the trunk and the trunk opening itself-- both are huge. LSD is an essential upgrade. Wheels look good. Brakes are excellent and stop on a dime. Unbeatable price.","Get rid of the gauges on the dash (g-meter and oil), they are childish and I have yet to look at them once while driving. I'd rather have the regular Sentra's storage cubbie. The Rockford stereo is weak. It cannot overcome road noise. 6.5"" speakers up front instead of 6x9s."
4.75,Smooth Operator,Dan ,10/01/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"This is a great car. We were first attracted to the elevated seat height, about 6 inches higher than Altima or Maxima. There is plenty of headroom and legroom for my 6'5"" frame. The car is very smooth and quiet on the road (think Buick) and handles very well. Very little body lean while cornering (think Jetta). The CVT works very well but it took some getting used to. Forget the tachometer and just drive. Aggressive driving has very little effect on fuel economy. It accelerates very nicely if you step on it. I have been getting 30+ MPG in suburban driving and 35 MPG on trips. It is the quietest car I have owned. You can carry on a normal conversation will passengers in the front or back.",Smooth quiet ride. Nice handling. Comfortable pit. Good fuel economy.,Better cup holders. Small compartment (for sunglasses) next to steering column is cheap.  The door fell off and I have had to snap it back together on occasion.

It looks great, not too over the top. Acceleration is brisk, but not rocket fast.  It handles well with a sporty feel, corners better than my Grand Am GT ever did.  The interior is roomy and can fit 3 booster seats for kids across the back row (tight fit, but it works). Front seats are great.  Trunk is large and easy to access.  Upgraded Rockford Fosgate Stereo is powerful and clear.  6 Disc changer is a nice feature, but most will use their MP3 players in the aux jack more than the changer.  Gripes are few, no cup holders in the rear and back bench does not split or fold.","Love the paddle shifters for those times when you want to have some fun.  17"" rims look great.  XM radio is a nice touch, and the stereo sounds great. Love the adjustable cupholders.  Every car company should copy these.  Engine is quiet and responsive.  AC fan is super quiet and works well.",Cupholders in rear and split fold bench would be the only improvements I could suggest.  Steering wheel audio controls and bluetooth would be nice too.  None of these should stop any potential buyers however.
4.75,Highly recommend,defabz ,09/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I have 5,250 miles on my Sentra, and I absolutely love it.  I had a 2006 Sentra, but there is no comparison.  It is perfect for a small family, even when traveling.  The back seat is quite comfortable.  I was not getting a new car until one with leather and a sunroof was in my budget.  Well, I got that plus blue tooth, upgraded stereo, keyless, and more.  Gas mileage has been excellent - 30 when mostly in town, 35-38 on hwy.  Gas mileage drops quickly if you drive aggressively, so I have had to really adjust to get the better efficiency.  Final deciding factor - Nissan negotiates!  I got it for $2,000 below dealer cost and in the color I wanted (transferred in).","Leather, sunroof, xm stereo with aux in, blue tooth, smart keyless entry.  The keyless saved me (twice) from locking keys in the cabin and trunk - it unlocked/popped open and beeped at me!  CVT is very smooth.","Dash is too bright when lights are off -  that is my reminder to turn the lights on.  I thought the tire pressure indicator would be great, but it is unreliable.  First it came on when the tires were fully inflated, then twice it didn't come on when the tires were under inflated, sigh."
3,Poor - Body Problems,Heather Friedline ,09/20/2008,,,3,1,1,1,,5,4,4,5,"My first experience with Nissan has been horrible.  My car is 6 months old and is rusting on both sides, back panel, below the doors.  Nissan will not cover the defect even though there are many of the same make and model with the same problem.  It drives well and I enjoy the vehicle but the interior plastic is also a problem with scratches from just normal use.  ",I enjoy the LCD display and I usually average 370-410 miles per tank of gas. The mechanics of the vehicle are also good. ,The body needs to be re-evaluated for the design flaw that causes the vehicle to rust.  The plastic in the interior needs to be stronger.  I wouldn't recommend a 08' Sentra to anyone until they fix the problems and stand behind their vehicles.  
4.875,Great Value,SonomaRed ,09/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I researched Corolla, Civic, and Jetta. I have driven my Sentra for 1200 miles, and am happy overall with my purchase. It is sharp looking, especially in Sonoma Red, and I am happy with the room inside the vehicle. I have good vision of the road, because you set the height of the drivers seat.","Lots of trunk space and folding rear seats were impressive. I disagree with Edmunds negative review of the droning noise the CVT makes on long drives. Lots of room and storage. Enough pep to pass slow moving vehicles. Digital display has been helpful for trips, gas economy, and song titles.","I am disappointed in fuel economy. I average 28-31 MPG on mixed driving.

5,Sentra SR Spec V,da3vid ,09/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Very quiet interior, makes the Fosgate stereo sound terrific. Puts my VW Jetta interior and ""advanced"" sound system to shame. Sport suspension is nice and tight. You feel the big bumps but don""t bounce on the small and medium. No leaning in cornering, which you can do very fast due to the road hugging ability. At 400 miles, MPG is combined 28.5 with about 80% being highway. Mileage on highway was about 31.8 when I reset the computer.  No initial defects found, very happy with the 6 speed manual transmission. The 200 HP let you use 2, 4 and 6th gears for normal driving. 1 & 2 get you into or across traffic fast, and 3 & 4 can make you feel like you are on a good roller coaster if you want.","A really fun driving sensation, the stereo, the HP, seat material, quietness.",Take the HP down just enough to use regular gas with this engine.
4.5,Great car with some cons,holly ,09/05/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"With over 10,000 miles on the car I'm overall pleased with it. Before it hit 1,000 miles the check engine light went on (the bad one where you can only drive 45 mph) and I had to drive home 300 miles going 45 mph. Not too happy about that, but the problem was fixed- gas tank issue. Killed the new car feel.  I have NEVER gotten over 31 MPG. I've driven it on 400 mile FLAT high ways driving 55. Tires, pressure, gas, windows up or down it does not seem to budge.  The inside scratches VERY easily inside. No matter how much I clean it, it's pretty much dirtied inside from just a shoe touching the interior.  The exterior it sturdy, but a shopping cart going super slow caused a small little dent.","CVT. Seamless cruise control that takes me up the PA mountains no problem. Very quite engine, and really nice pick up. ",Improve the interior materials so that it withstands every day use.

4.375,The best in its category,Venkat ,09/04/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"I researched Civic, Corolla and Sentra before deciding to buy the Sentra. I was impressed by its size and feel. Sentra was bigger, longer and wider then both Civic and Corolla. Even though I liked the looks of Civic more, I choose Sentra because of some key striking features. The gear shift knob was moved towards the dash to make more room in the driver's cabin. The CVT feature made the drive very smooth. I chose the intelligent key feature and the music system had an auxiliary jack which enabled me to play my iPod. All this combined with good looks convinced me to go for Sentra.

We test drove the Civic, Jetta, Corolla.  Although this is an ""economy"" car, you would never know it with all of the wonderful and useful features that it has. For starters, the design is really nice and modern. The glove compartment is huge, by far the largest of any car we test drove. The LCD display screen and on board computer is really neat and displays some useful information (average mpg, average speed, temperature, time, etc.).

Add to that weekend day trips and one 2,400 mile trip.  I drive with a light foot most of the time (engine about 2,500 rpm while accelerating), and I find it smooth and quiet.  When driven hard, it can be noisier than some of it's peers.  It has plenty of power for passing and mountain driving, even fully loaded.  It find it very comfortable, even on long trips.  I average 34-36 mpg driving the speed limit (65-70) in typical highway commuting, but as low as 27 mpg with mostly short trips.  I've gotten as high as 38 mpg on a tank-full on the open road at 65 mph.",The CVT is excellent and the first transmission I've ever driven that is cruise-control friendly when on hills and rolling terrain.  Intelligent key and built-in hands free are nice touches. OD-off button good for engine braking and occasionally increasing responsiveness.  Safer than most peers.,"Stock ""all-season"" tires completely unsuitable for winter driving.  The car ""jumps"" a bit too much over large bumps.

Estimated 33 MPG is just that, an estimate -""your cars mileage may vary, we cannot guarantee that you will get the stated performance.""  Also the car 'lags' in the 25-35 mph range when accelerating like you suddenly started towing something behind your car.","The color is nice.  The door openings are nice.

4.125,Adequate-performs satisfactory,Martin ,07/09/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,3,3,I leased this car for two years. It beat out two other models barely. I wanted a manual transmission but this one is real stiff and start offs are hard to mix gas with clutch. My Model A Ford is smoother. Once past 1st gear it's good. The car runs smooth and has plenty of power. The interior has good quality materials. I can manage for 2 years but will buy larger and domestic next time. Gas mileage is not too good right now but is over 30. I expect this will improve. This Sentra is a good solid car.,Roomy/ real nice upholstery - exterior looks.

Ride is good, also excellent A/C, good design, good back seat space, adequate trunk space, but small trunk opening will not accept many packages.

5,Definitely Recommended,Frank ,07/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I went from driving various trucks for 20 years to the Nissan Sentra. Like for many, gas prices drove the change. I evaluated all the small car options from: Mazda, Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet, Honda, Hyundai, and VW. This took me 4 weeks to complete. For a loaded every option Sentra SL, I feel like the time spent was well worth it. I'm getting about 32 mpg mixed and almost 36 mpg on the freeway.  The ride is very comfortable. I was a little skeptical of the CVT at first but I am a fan now. This is really a smooth drive. It's almost too comfortable in the leather seats and cruise control zipping down the freeway with the moonroof open and XM on! All I can say is: Buy it!","CVT, moonroof, leather seats made a big comfort change compared to the cloth, Steering wheel controls, Bluetooth, Intelligent Key system keeps the keys put away for vehicle access and driving, the split trunk storage is nice also.  Glove box space is really huge.","I rated the Interior Design a 9 only because I think the arm rest could be bigger,& the pedals could have a bit more spacing with the gas pedal a little to the left(away from the wall). On the Exterior, fold away mirrors would be great. Day time running lights (avail in Canada!) also."

5,Feels more than entry level,Michael ,06/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The car drives great. I was concerned when reading reviews after hearing that the car was uncomfortable to ride in, and that there was more noise than other cars, but when I test drove, I did not notice any of these. The car is as smooth as any I have ever been in, and road noise is no higher than any car I test drove, including the Civic. It handles a bit better than the Civic and other cars I tried as well.  Where it really shines, then, is the feature set. No other entry level car I looked could match the Sentra. I got an auxiliary jack for my iPod, steering wheel audio controls, and a bluetooth phone system. Not even the Civic could match that.","Great gas mileage, auxiliary input, bluetooth phone, comfortable, nice looking interior. Nissan cars are generally reliable. Excellent safety features", 
4.5,Love it,julie ,06/24/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,4,3,5,"I just traded in my 2004 Expedition for the Sentra.  It broke my heart.  But you have to do what you have to do.  For not being a ""car"" person, so far I love it.  The outside is sporty the inside is comfy.  A lot of great features for the money.  My only complaint is that I am not crazy about the mileage yet.  The car only has 600 miles on it so far.  I guess you have to ""break in"" the engine.  Or so I have read.  And I don't drive like a nut either so I was expecting more miles than I am getting.  From just about empty it costs $52 to fill up at $3.97 a gallon where I live.  Overall, I am happy.","CVT is pretty cool, has awesome pick up, hope that's not killing my gas mileage.

I drove the corolla as well, and there was just no comparison in how it felt.  Upon taking the test drive, I knew immediately this was the car for me.  The fuel economy is very good as well.  I've been getting 28-30 mpg on average with mixed driving, and up to 35 during pure highway driving.  Did I mention its fun to drive?  The CVT is so smooth and I feel that I'm getting better fuel efficiency without sacrificing power.  The styling is great.  I think it looks like a much more expensive car.

4.25,It's ok I guess,jc ,06/19/2008,,,4,4,3,5,,5,5,4,4,"Perfectly fine vehicle to get from point A to point B.  The ride was fairly smooth compared to other cars in the segment. I like the brisk acceleration.  The doors had a good solid feel.  This is the first car to get me car sick as a drive as the car rolled around in fast turns. I only averaged 28 mpg on the highway with the Sentra. This was probably due to the ride height, springy gas pedal and CVT config. Nissan still needs to improve their build quality.  Plastic looked like they came out of a generic brand toy.   Bottom line, you can get better driving dynamics, build quality, fuel economy or value with a Corolla, Civic or a Mazda3.","Smooth ride, decent acceleration during highway speeds with the CVT, light steering while parking, good visibility, quiet interior, nice solid doors.","Quality of plastics, fit and finish, colder AC, driving dynamics such as handling and throttle feedback, real world fuel economy, and better (not more) standard content (i expected Nissan was able to pack them in due to the lowered labor cost of mexico)"
4.75,Good so Far,FirstCar ,06/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Not too many miles driven, but they've been good miles thus far.  6 speed took a while to get used to, but that's because I transferred from a Jeep.  It has plenty of power for an economy car, loads of features, and looks very sharp (I got the black).  I'm 6'2 and I still have a few inches from the ceiling.  Everything is placed well, besides maybe the center console (nowhere to rest my elbow while shifting).  Trunk is HUGE, engine compartment open and easy to access (this will be great 5 to 10 years from now).  The base radio leaves a little to be desired, bluetooth a little clumsy (not synched well for my phone brand). Quiet, comfortable, does 80 just fine, cruises at low speeds well.","Center controls (A/C, radio, trip computer).  Trip computer about as good as the Chevy Malibus.

Vehicle has been completely reliable, as a new car should be. It's a very comfortable highway cruiser, with a smooth quiet ride and reasonably comfortable seats in a roomy interior. Build quality is good, but some of the interior plastic parts (like the dash top, sun visors and cubby holes) could really use some improvement. Styling is attractive to most people, especially in the ""magnetic gray"" paint. Interior is a charcoal gray, which is somewhat depressing color, but it hides dirt fairly well. It has plenty of space for 4 adults, but trying to put 3 adults into the back seat is not a good idea - not enough hip room.","The car gets excellent gas mileage that averages about 30 mpg in mixed driving. The trunk is huge for a compact car and is roomy inside for 4 people. It has a smooth and quiet highway ride. Price was reasonable given all of the safety features (ABS, front, side, and side curtain airbags).","The car needs better steering feel - the steering is very heavy at lower speeds and needs to have more power assist.

The CVT senses the engine is very strong and sets itself with high speed gearing to save fuel with low engine rpm: 1600 rpm at 60mph and 1200rpm at 45mph for over 27 mph while brand new. Ride is taut yet bumps fully absorbed. Steering is outstanding with 34 ft turn radius and a dead-flat-level suspension. Exterior is very striking and attractive. Paddle shifters on steering wheel allow CVT to be shifted like a six-speed..a way-cool feature. Intelligent tranny will perceive your foot off the gas on a downhill and drop the gearing to provide engine braking automatically without needing brakes.,"Low speed torque = surprising fuel economy. Quiet, bump absorbing ride with outstanding maneuverablity and terrific wheels and tires. Seating quality in SE-R way superior to regular seating. Highly recommend. CVT integrates with power seamlessly and can be shifted like a 6-speed manual. Sharp car.",Bluetooth and audio controls on wheel should be standard in SE-R as they are in 2.0S and 2.0SL.

Coming from a Buick Century, I thought, ""oh, a small, Japanese 4-cyl, well, at least it has a warranty."" Then I took it for a test drive.  The engine / transmission combination on even the 2.0 S model blows my old car away, and blows away my friends' Civics, Yarises, and even older V6-equipped cars. The interior leaves very little to be desired. Fuel economy is ridiculous compared to what I'm used to (avg. 30, city and highway), and I bought it without even trying the amazing stock stereo system. This drives like a much more expensive car, and swaddles you with geek-chic tech to make sure you don't forget it.","CVT, sound system (aux-in jack was a must), intelligent key, the general feel of driving it","The kind of person who gets the convenience package might stand to benefit from another power outlet in the front.

4.5,Perfect Car for now !,Ed Eberl ,04/22/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"After testing several cars including the Corolla, Focus and Mazda 3, the Sentra was the best choice.  The interior room is as big or bigger than my 2003 Dodge Stratus.  This is the perfect choice in a bad economy with insane gas prices.  I beleive the Sentra will be the next smart size family sedan replacing midsize cars, which are quickly become todays gas guzzlers.","The Sentra is quiet and super comfortable, I do not miss midsize cars now at all.

I had my heart set on a 2008 Max, but with the gas as high as it is, I'm glad I got the Sentra.  I am very impressed with this car, the speed, the interior, the exterior.  The style is awesome, looks like a mini Max, if the Sentra still had the body style that they had before 2007, I would not have purchased it. The 2008 Sentra has much more room, and the accessories are the best. There are only 2 things I don't like about this car and that is the tight steering and as with any small car, the wind blows it around.

I found the Sentra very roomy and lots of nice little extras such as a trip computer that will display, time, outside temp, and average fuel economy amongst other things.

The clutch makes a noise when depressed and again when released.  The side windows rattle in their seals.

I was leery of the CVT, but it feels great now. I think it will last a long time, especially the way that my wife drives it. She'll baby it.  Already the mileage is better than the old cars got at their best. The engine is more fuel efficient, while being bigger by 500 cc. We expect high 30 mpg once broken it.    The SE-R has anti-lock 4 wheel disc brakes and stiffer suspension than the car with 2.0 engine. It handles so much better.    The car is quiet and road noise is filtered out so well.

The wind noise is prominent and there are numerous rattles from doors and trim. The weather strips around the front doors are coming apart. This is not a luxury drive and the bumps in the road will confirm this; you will feel it in the seat of your pants and can be clearly heard in the cabin. Tap on the panels and trunk and you will get a hollow sound. The fuel economy is way below the advertised rating. The foot pedals are too close and any foot above a size 9 will be in for trouble.

3.125,Not a Japanese car,Chris ,03/31/2008,,,3,3,1,3,,4,5,3,3,The fit and finish is awful. The hood and trunk are off center.The trunk so much it almost touches the rear 1/4 panel on one side and has a 1/4 inch gap on the other. The plastic dash is not smooth and the edges stick up. The cheap labor shows here. The eyeglass holder is so hard to open you wind up pulling it from the dash. I dont even use it anymore. Bumps can be teeth jarring. Gas mileage is less than stellar. At this pricepoint there are much better choices. Shop around. This car will be going back at lease end and I will be back at Ford. Also no power seats rather an antiquated crank to raise seat height,Mist feature on wipers that's about it.,Fit and finish. Build quality. Suspension. Power seats.

I was also looking at the Mazda 3 but I was sold with the blue tooth phone and keyless ignition (I will never buy a car without that again)!

Any wind tends to blow it all over the road & it feels like I am wrestling a pickup or semi. The wind tends to suck the car sideways and blow it to the point that I have to turn the steering wheel 30 degrees off to hold it on the road on a day where the wind is 20 mph which sucks. Also on snowy days it tends to want to fishtail. Fuel economy is at best is 28 though typically 27 on the highway compared to my camry which got a solid 30.
