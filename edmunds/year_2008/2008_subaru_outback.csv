2,My first and last Subaru.,Alan Christenson ,10/27/2015,2,2,4,,,1,5,3,2,,,"We bought this car used in 2010 with 17,000 miles on it.  It was a great car until it hit about 70,000 when it started having regular repair issues that really shouldn't happen.  I fully expect to do maintenance on any vehicle for parts that wear out, but these problems are something different entirely.  First it was the head gasket problem that most of these have, that came to just under $2,000 for repair (known issue that should have been covered by Subaru). Over the last three years I had problems with the ground wire in the radio that I had ""fixed"" three different times until it went out entirely and I had to have the radio head unit replaced for $500. The  wires in the rear lift gate began breaking about a year ago causing my tail lights to go out.  This is apparently a common issue as well and is very dangerous (no tail lights at night) and should have been recalled.  That was $400 to replace.  My catalytic converter is going out now and apparently it has been recalled in some states, but not in mine so it's going to cost me another $1,000.  I also have problems in the passenger airbag light/switch that the dealership is telling me will be another $350 to fix.  A little research on the internet tells me that it is bad soldering on a circuit board (another common enough problem that it can be found on youtube).  Like I said, I gladly pay for regular maintenance and parts on a vehicle but these things are not ""normal"" problems and seem to be regular occurrences on Subarus.  Tack on to this substantially decreased winter mileage (I expect some, but not 15%-18%), and I can't see myself purchasing another Subaru.  Sure, you can probably pass them on to your children when you upgrade to a new one (just like the commercials show), but you're going to spend a lot of money to keep it that long and you'll be saddling them with something that appears to require regular, expensive repairs.",,

Computer screen is still functionally obsolete (I just want an image of my phone and I want to see the time and temperature larger). Gas mileage has never hit 33 for any length of time. Original opinionI had the 2008 2.5i. This vehicle has a lot of good - the engine seems to have more power, the continuous shifting makes for a smoother ride and better acceleration. On the ""just ok"" is the control screen. It's big, it catches dust and glares, the weather is useless for me because I don't live in a select city. Why would I use the navigation when I have my phone with all the addresses and a voice that talked me through the directions?

I got 33 mpg, 27 mpg in the city. If you obey the speed limits you will get very good mileage. If you need to ""punch it"" when driving, it is very slow to respond. The back seat isn't made for adults. I do like the dash board display. If you need to replace 1 tire, then you need to replace all 4 of them because of the symmetrical awd.

I normally leave SI drive in Intelligent mode but when necessary ""sport sharp"" mode (S#) provides that extra punch. The Outback's raised ride height means more suspension travel (take that speed bumps!) and it has a smooth ride over rough surfaces. I think the Outback looks the part of a luxury wagon. The interior is upscale and comparable to my 2004 Passat.  The materials feel substantial and fit and finish are excellent. Braking is very sure.",Subaru's legendary AWD is clearly my favorite feature even if it seems to get little use in everyday driving. The electroluminescent gauges are another favorite.

In general, the Outback looks just fine and the Limited model has a nicely appointed and comfortable interior.  However, the MPG on the outback is not very impressive  24.2 hwy (recent trip) and something under 20 around a very rural town. When compared to my Baja at 29 hwy and 24 town, Im loosing almost 82 miles per tank on the hwy (worth $11.00+/tank at todays prices and subject to increase in the future).  All in all, really wish I had kept my beloved Baja.  ","All wheel drive and overall utility of the vehicle (seating room/comfort, towing capacity, rear storage capacity, etc.) is excellent. Very cool, very large sunroof.","Ride is too firm, almost harsh. Maybe because of the recommended 33/lb air in tires. Low beam headlights are also odd. Some sort of height limiter on the beam, which is a real nuisance on darker rural, hilly roads. Can drastically reduce the length of road illuminated in front of you. Mileage!"
4.75,Great Choice,Doug ,03/24/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I did a lot of research and really wanted to buy my 4th Honda. I looked at the CRV and didnt like the interior. I am a fly fisherman and like to have a vehicle in which I can lie down and take a rest. I have a serious back problem and need to take breaks in my fishing day. The CRV just wasnt able to provide a long rear floor space. When the rear seats are folded down there is plenty of room for me at 59. Interestingly enough, the Honda dealer sent us to Subaru! The Subie us everything I wanted. I am an environmentalist and biologist so my carbon footprint and controlling pollution output is important. So far we have gotten 25 mpg in mixed driving short trips (a bit disapointing).",My favorite feature is the ride/handling combination. The wheel base is long enough to prevent pitching yet short enough to allow for a fairly tight turning radius. The smoothness of the ride is exceptional in a crossover vehicle and the AWD gives a sense of security that is difficult to match.,More comfortable passenger side seating would be desirable. I should have gone up to the Limited except I really wanted the manual gear box. There needs to be a coin box and some other accouterments in the cabin. The standard arm rest is weak and I fear it will eventually break.

Subaru came to my attention on both the NHTSA site, and the IIHS site for safety. Consumer Reports gave it high marks for reliability and user reports say 30mpg hwy.  I have come to this conclusion after the 1st 1000 miles:  it is as fun to drive as a Volkswagen Jetta or Passat, rated as safe or safer than any Volvo, yet has a reliability rating beating both of these.  Below 60 mph it is an absolute blast to drive.  I don't know why but it is. My wife keeps asking to take it for her local errands.   Above 60, steering is more sensitive than a Honda and is taking some getting used to.  ",Perfect combination of car/SUV/stationwagon without the fuel penalty. Sit higher than a car.  Fun to drive.  Utility/usefulness.  Autodimming mirror.  Everybody doesn't have one - not Honda or Toyota. Looks cool!,Bigger/better cupholders. Window frame should be added.  Less sensitive steering at hwy speeds.

We've been averaging around 26-27 mpg hwy, which is impressive considering the full time AWD.  A knock against the car is that we've had an issue with the passenger side airbag sensor. It turns on and off intermittently. We were told it's a safety design issue for small children. My wife is approx 5'4"" 110 pounds and doesn't always set off the sensor.

3.625,Word of Warning,John Q Public ,10/24/2007,,,5,5,5,2,,1,5,4,2,"While I was initially excited about the purchase after test driving a well running car, my ""dealer locate"" vehicle arrived with what is commonly known as ""stutter"" under boost.  The two dealers I have taken the car to both acknowledged the car does not run correctly, but they don't know how to fix it since it is most likely a computer issue.  The dealership has ""reflashes"" for different turbo models and it will fix the problem on some cars but not all and it often returns.  Subaru customer service has been no help, not even offering try replacing the computer on a $32k car with 6k mi. I am going to lemon law it.",,"After owning four other turbo cars and knowing what proper engine operation is, Subaru assumes the customer is an idiot and if you tell them ""that's normal for a turbo"" that should be fine.  If you test drive one, floor it, and if it stutters or bucks like a bronco, run away. Subaru wont fix it."
5,Satisfied,aflier ,10/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We are a two car family and use the Outback for around town as well as much freeway driving.  The car performs beautifully in all conditions.  Good feeling of security and reliability.  The car is a basic 4 and we got 28 mpg on regular gas.  This is our fifth Subaru and so far it is the best.,The car performs and drives with a strong feel of security. Good riding car with a great feel for the road.,This car fits our needs very well so we do not have any qualms with its design and performance.
5,Nice Change For Us,Andy S ,10/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is our first Subaru and we're very favorably impressed. The car is quiet and handles very well both on the road and in the field when we're taking feed to the run-in sheds. Fuel mileage is great for a full time all wheel drive vehicle. Safety and reliability were key factors in selecting a Subaru. These cars are legendary in both areas and their strong, cult like customer loyalty reflects it.","We like the big two piece moon roof and the solid, comfortable feel of the car. It gives you a strong sense of security and the moon roof lets in plenty of light and air when you want it.",Make deep tinted windows and moon roof standard on every wagon. People travel with pets and small children and they need dark windows to help cool the car. A little more horsepower or torque would be nice but not at the expense of fuel mileage.
5,Subaru,Barbara Bengels ,10/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Adequate acceleration, stable braking, air conditioner dual controls and seat warmer excellent, single roof window works fine. Quite pleased with it. Miss cassette tape deck. Would like MP3 port.","Seat warmer, moon roof, air conditioner.",MP3 port and tape deck.
4.75,Best Outback yet,Andrew ,10/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"My third Outback and by far the best. Wanted a fun mid-life car, needed a practical car for the fam and the mountains. Subaru hits the mark with the XT turbo! Far more fun to drive than my H6 2002 LL Bean! It drives very tight and solid, very smooth and quiet, turbo kicks in nicely and pulls you along beautifully. I love wagons and the XT is the best combination of any brand/model.  Steering wheel feels good in my large hands. Still trying to find the best seat position for my tall self.  Skip the nav and add your own portable, upgradeable Garmin or other. Looked at SUVs (Tribeca, Highlander, RAV4, CR-V, RDX) and prefer XT.  Great car for my wants and needs!","Beautiful gray color with nice off black interior. Great stereo (but had to tame the subwoofer)! Very fun to drive yet hauls us and gear around beautifully. Nice, simple dash and display layout, not high-techy cheesy like so many other cars today. Drives wonderfully. AWD!","More small storage, coin drawer. Doors feel slightly less solid than previous. Mid-row LATCH car seat attachments. Gas mileage as expected but still I dream it could be better. Ashtray is almost useless; make a trash drawer instead. "
5,"Great value, fun!",cdb9000 ,09/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought this car 4 months ago, replaced 2001 Toyota Landcruiser.  Tired of paying $75 premium, now I pay $35 regular to fill it!  Owned 2 Volvo wagons (new) before my LC, and the Subaru compared to those in comfort and luxury. I looked at the Honda CRV and Rav4, too.  CRV had good safety, but so cheap inside I couldn't stand it.  Rav4 has very poor rear crash test, and I don't like when Mac trucks come up on my rear when I'm stopped and sitting in a car with no bumper. Acceleration is fine, it's no BMW or 8cyl, but gets me from here to there safely and in comfort! The Subaru has 5 star safety ratings all around - very important to me (and kids). Check out IIHS website for crash ratings.","Comfortable power seats. Safety rating. Ground clearance for charging into driveway in snow. Leather, nav, auto dim mirrors, leg and side room (great space between you and the door!). 30 mpg highway after 7000 mi, 25 city. 6 CD, cool illuminated instrument panel, under 30K, can't wait for snow!","Seat belt chime, no useful roof racks (what's with these useless curved crossbars on cars these days?), halogen headlights, typical Subaru engine noise (ext. only)... but you know you're going to get that!"
5,Subaru Outback Limited with VDC,TODD SIGLER ,09/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just bought my outback limited w/VDC about 3 weeks ago.  At first, my vehicle was hesitating very badly and I took it back to the dealership where they said it was a loose #3 spark plug wire.  I was not happy at this, to say the least.  However, since the spark plug has been adjusted 2 weeks ago, my vehicle has been performing very well.  My ride is much smoother than most vehicles I've been in; I don't feel bumps in the road as much as other vehicles.  The AWD is wonderful in handling a lot of turns as I live in West Virginia.  ",The panoramic moonroof opens beautifuly with a view of the southern sky.  Drives very smoothly at a high rate of speed.  Very well insulated such that there is no outside noise with the windows shut.  Takes turns very smoothly.  The stereo system is awesome!,Acceleration could be improved in going from 0 to 60.  Windshield likes to fog up when there is only slight humidity in the air (have to use the defrost too much).  
3.25,"Transmission blown at 4,200 miles",John Kasperowicz ,09/18/2007,,,4,4,3,1,,4,3,4,3,"I have owned many Subaru models in the past years. This new 2008 Outback will be my last. The transmission blew out at 4,200 miles and left me stranded. I think that the new transmission selection of different modes might have contributed to failure. This new feature is more of a gimmick than a useful option. Ride of car is not good, very jarring over small potholes or minor dips in road.  Way too much road noise. Leather quality of seat not very good for 32k car.  Overall, car is not worth the money and quality of parts and the interior is lower than previous models.",All wheel drive.,Seat quality and comfort. Self dimming side view mirrors. Road noise must be lowered.
3.875,Stability Control Requires Leather Seats,ruddyduck67 ,09/14/2007,,,3,4,4,5,,4,4,3,4,"Best midsize value on the market.  I wanted stability control as an extra safety measure but was kind of annoyed that this requires a whole host of non-safety oriented upgrades like leather seats and a moonroof (which is actually very nice).  The other wagons in the lineup require premium fuel!?  Yeah, I wanna spend an extra 20 cents per gallon for the life of the car. Anyway, it is a very nice driving car, very tight for a wagon, and can carry anything when considering the interior and the roofrack.  One more thing about the roofrack, take off your crossbars when not in use.  That little effort will take 5 minutes and can save you on mileage.  ","Driving position, dual moonroof, corering stability.","Storage kind of stinks.  Glove box doesn't fit much.  Silly little ashtray is all but useless.  No practical change holder.  And as a running theme, work on better mpg.  I am averaging 20 mpg. Talk to Toyota about dropping a hybrid under the hood."
4.875,Utility meets Luxury and Reliablitity,FXOFFROAD ,08/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"This is a blast to drive. Mileage is good and the sport shift truly rises to the occasion. Hard to believe this is 4 banger that cost under 30,000 for the 2.5i Limited. I trade a 2003 Ford F250 so it was a dramatic change,  but definitely for the best. Test drove Honda CRV, Ford Edge, Escape & Explorer, Audi wagons. But for the value, the Outback was truly the best choice. Extremely satisfied. Taken up to the Colorado Rocky Mountains often and its performs extremely well. Compared to my 07 Lexus ES, this vehicle is truly a great value for its outstanding build quality, AWD, and economy.","Overall value! AWD, sunroof, VDC, comfortable seats, sport shift on automatic. Very comfortable seats.  ","Coin drawer, sunglass holder (not available w/ the sunroof), power tailgate lift, dual climate control should be independent of air source (outside or recycled interior air). Navigation available on the Limited version. More aggressive all-season tires other than the Bridgestones."
4.625,Basis model beats Rav4 in smackdown,Lk Superior north sh ,08/20/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,3,5,5,5,"Had great Mazda3 but couldn't sleep with winter coming, spent two weeks checking out Rav4 options. Then drove the Suby, game over. Rav4 has +7ft cargo, +800lbs towing, and losses on at least a dozen other comps. This is a classy ride, I don't need speed. It's got all the winter things Toyota charges extra for. Better ride than either Base Rav or Rav Sport. 4AT has 3 modes, what else could I need? The basic climate and audio systems are a good trade off for heated 8 way power seats and true AWD. ","Heated everything, great road feel, easy to get kayak on top, 31.8 mpg on first tank, never under 25 so far, 34 on nice 50 mph north shore scenic road. Beautiful charcoal cloth interior, 3 AT modes. Only 1000 miles on it, but I can't wait to get past new car phase and explore.","Just put the subwoofer in at the factory. Dealer has a 48 step install, not going to have my new car disassembled quite yet. Really short on driver storage spaces, but hey, it's so comfy in there I'll carry a purse. And, put the audio controls on the steering wheel, we all expect that now."
4.875,Second review after 3 months,gtskier ,08/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Great fun to drive. Mileage is better than expected, 24 mpg in SI Drive - ""S"" mode driving up and down canyon 5400 to 9200 feet on weekly shopping trips and local mountain driving daily.  Handles great on curves, highways, dirt.  One exception: factory Bridgestone tires squirm excessively on grooved pavement.  Road noise is a bit high, but crank up the great stereo with SRS-WOW, MP3 CD and jack.  Can't wait to see the VDC work on snow and ice this winter.  ",,
5,Ranch Mom Liking 08 OB,Ranch Mom ,06/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After 3 years of researching I decided it was time to downsize from my Ford Excursion. I love my Excursion, but couldn't stomach the cost of driving it any longer. Even though the Subaru is a world apart from my ""bus"", I am getting used to the small size. The Ltd's fit and finish compared to other crossover vehicles was far superior. It is smooth to drive and after two tanks I've averaged 28 mpg in mixed driving. I'm 6 foot tall and with the much loved sunroof, the head room is tight and the leg room is adequate, while the backseat's leg room is snug for adults. I enjoyed driving the XT but with the premium fuel requirement and decreased mpg I couldn't justify it.","The limited's sunroof, leather and wood trim sets the OB apart.  The  08's grille gives it a sporty look.  Good overall feel when driving.  Great gas mileage for AWD.",Legroom in back seats and head room in front. Lumbar support in passenger seat.  More cupholders and places to put loose change. Bluetooth would be nice.
4.875,Do Everything,Ron Boller ,05/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Have a 2002 WRX, wanted a vehicle with power and handling that had more room, more ground clearance and more comfort. The Outback XT fit the bill. The WRX is fun and to this point bullet proof. The Outback does not corner as well, but is a fast and much more comfortable. So far so good.",The engine is flexible and powerful. Very happy with it.,"Gas mileage could be better, but is what I expected."
4.625,"Still great cars, more fun than ever!",gtskier ,05/22/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Great vehicle, moving upscale to compete with the likes of Audi and Acura in the AWD crossover arena.  Too bad they got rid of the steering wheel buttons/paddles on the limited, went to other controls for stereo and cruise. The iDrive system is cool, maps the throttle response and upshift points to economy, sport and sport sharp.  If you keep it in economy, expect mixed driving mileage at about 22-23.  In sport or sport# mode expect maybe 16 mpg and lots of tickets! ","All wheel drive is set up like a sports car now, not your grandma's subie. ",Shift paddles on column.  
4.625,'08 OB Looking Good,Outbacker ,04/27/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Just traded in my '01 Outback for the '08 Limited model.  I had doubts about buying another Outback - the last one was not much fun to drive, and there were some leaking problems after 90K.  After test driving all the comparables, the Outback was the only one that fit the bill - reasonable gas mileage, good safety ratings, reliable, good roof rack for the surfboard, and can hold 25 bags of mulch in the back when needed.  So far, so good.  The '08 is lots more fun to drive than the '01 - the sports shift option helps.  A little more power than the '01, and a generally smoother, better ride.  I'm told that the leak problems have been resolved - time will tell.","Interior and exterior design, general riding comfort, sound system, sports shifter, sun roof, option of Sirius radio.","A couple of features from the '01 are missing - there's no longer a good place for loose change or sun glasses, and the cup holders are not as snug.  Small stuff, but would be nice."
