Nissan tried their best to sell me another one, but they couldn't budge me from purchasing this one. One fine truck. 50K on it and not one issue what so ever.

I wish they would have told me this when I purchased the truck. Wish they would have said when you come back to trade your truck in you will get a  big screwing.Truck depreciated $14,800 in 1 1/2 yrs wow. Worst fuel mileage ever. Bad resale/trade in value.

4.125,Mixed Feelings,Truck Dude ,11/06/2010,,,5,4,4,5,,4,5,2,4,"The 5.6 puts you a quick stomp away from instant gratification. A good mash when you are not loaded will put you in the back seat. The throaty exhaust note is hard to beat. 390 lbs of torque makes the Titan the best tow rig I have ever driven. The suspension is spot-on. The interior is quiet and the seats are awesome. However, the truck has it's down side. The sloping front end and flared rear fenders make judging distance in a parking lot quite difficult- rear blind spots swallow a Caddy with 10ft to spare. The turning radius isn't exactly competitive. Fuel economy is worst in class- mostly highway, I avg'd 14. I got 17 mpg hwy with a tonneau cover and 10 mpg with an enclosed trailer.",The sheer power is the best thing this truck has going for it. ,"This sounds stupid, but the paint is incredibly easy to scratch. Aside from that, the best change would be some modern tech in the intake/fuel system to boost the MPG. 17 should be the average, not the absolute best.

1,Horrible,m951 ,10/30/2010,,,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,"Not reliable at all. The worst gas mileage. Barely any horsepower. Isn't very good for towing. I hate eveything about it. I upgraded to an 08 tundra and do not regret it one bit. It has way more horse power and towing capacity and is more comfertable, a lot of fun, and much better on gas.

4.375,My first Nissan,Dave ,10/11/2010,,,4,5,5,4,,5,5,2,5,"Bought the truck during a hail sale. Had my eye on it for at least 3 months but wouldn't jump on it. When the truck got hail damage, they knocked $4000 off, and I guess I couldn't say no.  I have not been disappointed since. Sure, there are some small issues (interior material choices, not having all the options) but it doesn't detract from it's drivability, or my comfort.  The interior cab is so huge, I usually work remotely and can plug in a laptop, rest it on the front center console, and use my back seat as my office space.

The Titan is smooth, fast, reliable, and comfortable with the captains power seat.  The only issues I have had were a bad A/C condenser fan, leaky radiator cap, and I fixed the A/C drain tube myself.  No squeaks or rattles, solid brakes, handles like a smaller truck. The paint and plastics quality is sub par, other than that and the 12-13 mpg there are no downsides to owning a Titan.

A deal was almost struck, but first had to drive the Titan. The dealer had what I was looking for, and once I drove it, there was nothing to compare with the others.

Over-all we are happy with the truck, plenty of power, handles nicely, luxury interior, awesome sound system (Rockford Fosgate), rides better than a Chev although it mainly has to do with the great seats (the truck has a much more heavy duty suspension and chassis set-up), and has very unique and handy features.

As far as fuel economy goes, that too has been a pleasant surprise. We're getting about 15 to 15.5mpg in town driving. You have to keep your foot out of it for sure. Its actually a little better on fuel mileage than the Tahoe. I love the interior design & feel its definitely an improvement over the Tahoe workmanship. Smooth ride. Only downside is it is loud!

The Titan has been everything I could have ever wanted it to but, until recently, I don't know if it's the harsh temperature or just a flaw from Nissan, but I've taken it back to the dealership 2x and still the axle squeaks every time I brake or just drive under 10mph. Other than that it's awesome!!","LOTS OF ROOM!!! You can seat belt 6 people inside, but you can easily fit 10 (tried and true). Took it up and down a mountain, couldn't ask for anything more.

4.375,Good Truck/Bad Company,John ,11/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,2,3,5,"Did my homework. I love my Titan with a couple of exceptions. Soon after purchase, it felt like there was a role of quarters in the left side of my seat cushion. To their credit, dealer replaced seat. However, seat is still uncomfortable (should have got the leather I suppose). Also, the truck has no outside temp gauge - I can't believe it. Dealer is no help and emails and calls to Nissan net no response at all. As a result, I will never buy another Nissan product. Other than that, I really do like everything else about this truck. But alas, I hear Nissan is giving up after their first try. I wonder where the Tundra would be if Toyota gave up after just one shot at it?","Power, smooth tranny, ride, four doors AND long bed in 1/2 ton, lots of room, built in outside extending mirrors, spray in bedliner, tie down cleats, auto windows down with keyfob, soft lowering tailgate, backup warning system, and my front bench seat.  Hardly notice my 26' trailer, except at pump.","Add an outside temp gauge, make front seat more comfortable, and work on improving gas mileage.

4.75,Most Fun Full-Sized Pickup Available,Dave R. ,09/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,I was looking to buy another Sierra until I sat in a Titan at the Auto Show.  This truck has the most comfortable seating of any vehicle I have ever sat in as well as a ton of leg room (important for me as I have long legs).  I tow an 18' fiberglass boat that is kind of heavy and this truck pulls it very well.  The nav system is excellent and a nice option to have.  It was hard to find one with side air bags as the package for air bags includes an electronic stability system - both of which I feel should be standard on all vehicles.  Gauges are well designed and easy to read.  The transmission temp gauge is nice to have if you are towing anything.,"Nav, 20"" tires & wheels, DVD system, Rockford Fosgate audio system.",Make side air bags and elecronic stability standard on all versions of the truck.

Love the quality, performance and overall satisfaction of my older 2005 titan. This new one is awesome. Great performance. Great sound system and just a good truck.

This configuration is awesome!  The cabin is very comfy, seats are soft, rear leg room is limo-like.  Power of the big V8 is incredible, the car is quiet, decent sound system and has lots of fun toys like the bluetooth.  It behaves very well for a truck, soft over the bumps, but feels very tough at the same time. Definitely underrated as far as the full truck segment goes and it's a shame Nissan hasn't done a better job marketing the truck.","Exterior and interior styling, 20"" rims, bluetooth (AWESOME), 20 mpg on the freeway in a huge truck is impressive.

My wife has a minivan but unless we are taking a trip, we take my truck and the three kids fit comfortably in the back seat. I love the bed and the things I can do with the adjustable bed rails.  Gets what the sticker said it would for MPG when I use regular unleaded.  I lose about 22% if I use e85 so I only use that when it is 22-25% less than regular.  So far, that is often but my small town BP sells it so it is convenient for me. Fun to drive, nice to look at, and very functional.  I need to go back to the dealer to fix the Bluetooth but otherwise, no complaints.","Versatile bed, driver memory for key and fob.  I love the leather interior and the comfortable ride for a big 4WD.

Hauled lots lumber so far almost 2000 lbs. Handled it well and drove great with the load. This truck is fun to drive and easy to hop up as well. Going to get an air intake kit soon.

I like the fact they dont make 3 engines for it. Keeping the 5.6 trustworthy and reliable.They fixed the brakes. Bigger rotors and pads  for 2008. Nice  :),The inside is nice.

Gas mileage has been so-so, all city driving (including moderate hills) gets me 13.7-14.1 mpg but a truck is a truck.  I havent really done enough interstate miles to get a good evaluation of that mileage. ","R-F speakers sound great, great acceleration (even at cruising), roomy cab (lift back seats up and have lots of room on floor for dogs to lay down), easy lift tailgate, fender storage is handy for straps etc, pwr rear window. Fits very nicely in garage (shorter bed), center console can hold folders.","Bleutooth is limited to specific phones, window/mirror controls are on top of the door panel vs. down by the door handle, garage door openers should be in overhead console (not mirror), stereo is broken up into component parts vs. one unit and display is dated (think digital alarm clock)."
4.875,A lot of unexpected amenities!!,Terry ,10/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've owned 2 Frontiers in the last couple of years. I got a buy back letter from Nissan and decided to take a Titan PRO-4X for a test drive. I just had to have it. Bluetooth is awesome, Fosgate stereo sound great. Seats are very comfortable and interior is well thought out.","Bluetooth, stereo, locking rear diff.",Quaife style limited slip in the rear with a locking diff would be nice.
4.75,Surpasses expectations!,Leo Gomez ,10/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Recently had to choose one of the 5 great full sizes offered.  The Nissan was not only very well priced, but it's the only 1/2 ton pickup with a full size 4dr cab and a 7ft+ bed.  Great combo for someone like me who loves to put motorcycles in the back and go camping.  Very quiet which is great, the dual zone climate control works flawlessly and the chairs are comfortable!","The bluetooth option is awesome!  Works so well.  The power is awesome, handles great, and is so quiet!  Interior is really nice for a truck.  I dig the rockford fosgate system, really great! Utilitrak system in the bed is very useful as well!","Add a 6th gear for maybe 1 or 2 mpg more on the freeway, can't complain though, everyone knows what happens when you buy a truck with a big V8!"
5,Amazing Truck!,Joe B. ,10/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I did my homework. I got the preferred package XE which makes it similar to SE. I test drove all REAL sized trucks, Ford, Chevy, Dodge, Toyota.  The Nissan had a spacious cab (felt larger than the others), nice included features, a large engine, lots of power, smooth ride, fun to drive and the girls love it. It was a no brainer!","I really like the power rear window. The powerful engine is great and it sounds great.  Styling is good too, I get compliments on it everywhere I go.  ",Can't think of any.
4.625,My First Full-Size,Steve ,10/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"This is my first full-size pickup and I must say that I am pleasantly pleased with my purchase.  The thing that made me go Nissan (besides its attractive looks, great engine and value) was the fact that it was one of the largest interior and short-box bed pickups that actually fit in my garage.  The interior is very well put together and the features are luxo-car plush.  The navigation is high resolution and the gauges glow attractiveley at night.  I do wish for a touchscreen nav and incoming call info for the Bluetooth coming from an Acura TL and being spoiled.  I have already hauled two huge loads (one 2,400 lb sand and one 2,040 lb brick) and the truck handled it with ease.","Exterior stance and presence.  Interior room, comfort and features especially nac and bluetooth.  Dampened tailgate and bedliner are great, useful additions.  Uses regular fuel and getting about 14.8 mixed driving at 6,000 feet above sea level.",Intelligent key like Nissan's cheaper cars (even the Versa) have.  Shiftable tranny for floor mounted auto.  Touchscreen on navigation and allow you to program it while driving. We do drive with passengers who can do the programming while we keep our eyes on the road.
4.75,Nissan did their homework.,Drew Hensarling ,09/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I've looked at the Titans for a long time and was excited about the remodel for 2008.  I took advantage of the rebate offered and am pleased with the price paid.  Nissan really did a good job designing this truck and the interior room is outstanding.  The only options that I got on the SE were floor mats and a bedliner.  That's really all I need because there are already lots of features that come standard.  The ride is stiff but comfortable and I've been surprised at the quietness of the ride so far.  All in all, I'm very pleased and am glad I chose this over the F-150 and Silverado.",Interior room.  Exterior design.  6-disc CD changer that comes standard on the SE.  18 inch wheels are nice.,Better fuel economy but it is a V8 after all.
5,Best Nissan,joe siudock ,09/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We are a Nissan family with three in the driveway. We traded our LE 4dr Frontier for the Titan. Rides better, seats feel better  with its arm rests. Drives great on the highway. Dark blue with tan seats look great. The front looks looks so much macho. Stereo much better than the Frontiers. On top of it the Titan was cheaper than our Frontier. Mileage isn't that much of the diference from the Frontier, yet we feel safer.",Radio.,Make the step ups standard on the SE.
5,Best by far!,Jonathan ,08/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is by far the best truck on the market. I had an 04 Titan and traded up for the 08 and I am strangely imprssed more with this truck than I was the first go around. Great interior/exterior, awesome luxury features and it drives like a car with tons of power.  People will only gripe about the mpg, but what do you expect from a truck with this type of engine. All the testing reports prove that the GM brands claim they get the highest, but get the lowest.  I have been getting about 15 city.  I priced out every vehicle with my options and this truck was not only the best, but with the current rebates on all 5 makers, it was 3,400 cheaper than any, and mine is an 08 compared to their 07's","Bluetooth, imformation center, utilitrack, bedside storage, spray-in bedliner and 20 rims included in LE (all others charge extra) tailgate assist, etc.","Make the bluetooth and navigation systems just like the 08 Pathfinders, as I like the functionality of those more than on the Titan."
5,Great Truck,DB ,08/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just traded in my 2006 Audi A4 Quattro and my 2004 Ford Ranger for this truck.  I've always loved my audi for its fit and finish, and fun to drive factor and the ranger for its ability to tow our boat and jetskis.  I needed a full size truck to tow our ""toys"" more easily.  The Titan is great for towing and has every single feature I had on my Audi.  It's the best of both worlds.  The truck was fully loaded with XM radio, Rockford Fosgate audio, leather, moonroof, nav, bluetooth, rear dvd ent system.  In one week I've racked up 1980 miles  avg highway is 17 mpg, city approx 13.  If you drive over 70, say 80ish,  fuel econ drops sharply to 14-15. PRO4x ride is firmer than LE but smooth on highway.","Bluetooth, XM radio, towing ability, captains chairs are comfortable.  White speedo tach and driver display area.  Upgraded radio is decent.","Bluetooth system is not fully compatible with the motorola razr.  My audi would show incoming calls, signal strength, and battery.  The Titan only allows for ""voice dialing"", you cannot see your phonebook or scroll through it.  Where is a diesel engine for better gas mileage??"
5,The Winner,W. Smith ,07/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have driven my 08 Titan 2500 miles so far and this is a great truck.  I test drove the chev, ford, and toyota and the Titan won by a landslide.  Better comfort and interior than the new Tundra, better performance, comfort and fit and finish than the F-150 and the Chevy.  I am getting 15.9 MPG city driving, 17.1 hwy. In addition it has a smaller exterior and a roomier interior than all the competition, very well thought through.","Fit and finish, seat comfort, overal shape and size of vehicle is the best out there.  Exhaust note is superb.",Offer smaller mirros with towing package.
5,Great Truck!,Tigger ,07/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a great truck, It handles almost like a car, has power at every RPM and hauls a car trailer with ease. At 75 mph it was only turning 2800 rpm and I averaged 13 mpg hauling close to 7000 lbs over 700 miles.","Utility track system, bedside storage compartment, tailgate assist, electronic 4WD, Rockford Fosgate audio system.",
5,The Best Full Size,W. Smith ,07/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Smooth and quiet, great handling, very comfortable cabin.  Drove all the competition and this wins by a landslide.","Seats, gauges, drivetrain.",None.
4.875,Titan Rocks!!!,James ,05/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Absolutely the best truck I have ever owned. I get a new one every few years and I have had all the other manufacturers. I have really enjoyed this truck. The only negative is that the gas mileage is not as good as the GM brands. Everything else is better by far.,"Horsepower, towing capacity, comfort, the Rockford Fosgate stereo system, sprayed in bed liner with the bed lock down system.",Better gas mileage.
