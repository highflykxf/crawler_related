After a few months I started to have engine power problems transmission problems, losing power, running rough. I also had problems with the stabilitrac and antilock brakes. I went to the dealership and they had no answers or ideas on what the problem was. I did some research and a domino effect of thing were improved by a new egr valve as well as plugs and wires. I did all repairs myself to save hundreds. All the problems went away and I've put 10's of thousands of miles on it with no more issues.",,

However, Ive now had the power steering hose break three times and Im growing tired of repeatedly fixing it. My battery also died at only 44,000 miles and the all-wheel drive regularly goes out when the temperature dips below zero, which is the type of weather when you mostly need AWD. I love the comfort, look, features, and how the Torrent drives, but Im now looking at a new car as Im sick of these mounting piddly issues. I never once had my 04 Malibu 2LT in the shop beyond oil changes in the 7 years, 80K+ miles I owned it.

4.125,Knew What I Was Getting,czuchster ,09/24/2010,,,4,4,4,5,,5,5,2,4,"There are some squeaks here and there, especially with the steering wheel, but I read the reviews before I bought the car and I knew what to expect. The only disappointment has been with the gas mileage, which hasn't quite been up to the EPA estimates. Even my Hondaphile and Toyotaphile friends have been impressed with the comfort and looks of my Torrent. On the safety front, I was in an accident three months ago that sent two other drivers to the hospital but I didn't get a scratch, or even feel sore the next day. I can't rave enough. I've looked at trading it in for something with better MPG, but I can't find anything I'd give up for Torrent for.","The biggest plus in my book has been the spacious back seat -- when family members who are six-foot-plus pile in the back, they can't believe their knees aren't bumping against the back of my seat. Definitely worth my investment.","Now that Pontiac is gone, that would be pointless, huh?"

I too was recently in a serious collision on a busy highway and walked away without a scratch only because of the vehicle I was driving.

Sad but this Pontiac Torrent is a rock solid performer and for good value. It is said GM always stops building a car when they got it right.  I echo most of the comments above. This is a fun to drive vehicle and handles  well for the 3.4L Minor gripes: the cupholder window control, Perhaps a luggage rack bar on top as standard.  Back  seat room is far superior to all other  midsize SUVs.  The only problem? My  20 year old daughter  now ""claims"" it as her primary driving vehicle!

So much so I added a Torrent to the stable.  The Equinox and Torrent are fun to drive and I have had zero problems.  A little over 20 in the city and 24-26 on the highway MPG.

Mine came fully loaded with DVD entertainment system which included a pair of Panasonic wireless headphones. It also has OnStar and XM raidio. The sound system sounds great and movies really rock coming out of the cars speakers. The wireless headphones sound great and are much much better than I thought they would be. I really like how the 60/40 rear seat can slide almost 8 in. I must say the GXP's 264 hp engine really delivers.It gives you plenty of get up and go and lots of power to tow. I drove mine through the Rocky Mtns towing over 3000 lbs and had no problem on the very steep grades. This is my first SUV and I love it.,"264 hp auto/manual engine, DVD entertainment system, XM radio CD player & speaker system, OnStar, paint & wheels, tow package, sliding rear seat, factory remote start, driver info computer, roof rack, dash apperance and layout, heated seats, upholstery material and color, safety features.",Front power port needs to be closer to the dash (no big deal though).

3.75,Comfortable Cross Over,Rob L.  ,10/05/2008,,,3,4,4,4,,4,4,4,3,"This is a very good riding cross over type SUV.  It gets very good gas mileage on the highway - about 25 to 26.  The controls are pretty good, but the steering and handling on the base model is unacceptably sloppy. If you like this vehicle, get the GXP model which has a different and tighter steering system. The center console could be a lot better and more useful - it lacks storage and the center mounted power window buttons are not intuitive. ",XM Radio;  good gas mileage; comfortable ride. Sight and sound package (stereo upgrade and sunroof),Tighter steering;  The night time instrument lighting (red on red) is very difficult to read at a glance.

5, I'm in love,Joey ,09/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just brought this baby home and I'm smitten.  I test drove several SUVs over Labor Day weekend (the 2008s were priced to move).  I didn't even know that Pontiac had a crossover (I was familiar with the Equinox, which is the same vehicle).  I was about to pull the Trigger on a Santa Fe, which actually had a nicer interior with more storage, but once I test drove the Pontiac, I was sold.  The 3.4 L pulls that rig right up to speed with no problem, and the handling was tight like a sports sedan.  Compared to the Santa Fe and the Escape, the Torrent won on performance alone (and good looks).  Also, I averaged 26 MPG on the 120 mile freeway drive home.  Not bad for a big vehicle like this.","Pontiac grille, performance, ride, handling, AUX input jack, and my favorite:  The beautiful two-tone interior (black and tan).  The driver information center, with trip computer is nice.  Being able to check my exact tire pressure from inside the car, while driving.  Great gas mileage too!","Not nearly as many storage bins as the others that I tested.  Could have better cup holders.  No manual shift mode (preferred for mountain driving), rear glass does not open separate from the lift gate. None of these things are deal breakers for me, but they are legitimate gripes. "

The Torrent is fun to drive, don't believe the reviews about it being ""mushy"" etc. The 3.4 V6 has plenty of spunk.  The vehicle performs very well in town and on the highway.  Highway mileage is about 25 and city is about 18.  Plenty of room inside for 4 adults for long distance and 5 adults is not problem for shorter drives, rear seating has amazing leg room and front seat passenger seat has more room than the Envoy.

Enough space to carry just about anything, but handles like a compact, that fabulous Pontiac power steering and transmission.  Pontiac is the true signature American car; sharp style at first glance, muscle when you need it, smooth ride, fun and always dependable.  I have done weekend driving with the Murano and the Jeep Liberty and the Torrent beats both no contest.  It has all the classic benefits of a Pontiac:  fast start, stylish interior and exterior, affordable price (at $26,000 it is $12,000 cheaper than the Murano) and great on gas.  I get 27 miles to the gallon, and it only takes $61.00 to fill up the tank.  I love this car.","Looks expensive though it's affordable, a SUV that handles like a fun car, 27 mpg, comfortable seats and plenty of back seat room, 0-60 in 5 seconds, pretty teal color, space for my purse next to the driver's seat, great sound system.","The shoulder strap does not come down low enough for short people, and catches me on the side of the neck.

This SUV is fun to drive, has enough horsepower to carry 4 good size (and then some) people without dragging its feet, and handles very well. Even though it has lots of room inside, it's not a huge land barge like the Escalade. My friend bought a Ford Explorer and his 15 mpg is killing him. I've always had good luck with Pontiacs, and this looks like another winner.","Spare tire is in the car, not hung under the chassis like my Santa Fe. Power is more than adequate.

If you are looking for a vehicle like this, you really owe it to yourself to give it a try.  I know of Honda owners who don't get but a 1mpg more in their smaller CR-V and no fun factor at all.
