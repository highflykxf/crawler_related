4,want a newer car but dont want to trade mine in,Kim Lane ,09/14/2016,4,,4,,,5,5,4,4,,,"This car has great acceleration , it is a nice looking car  and have had no problems with it  at all   I want a newer car but like this so well that I have become super picky and I really don't want to trade it in  I don't understand why the trade in value is not higher . I bought it for the handling and my husband loved the safety ratings . I had owned several jeeps but this car is at least if not much better built. This vehicle is not a car and doesn't drive like one  but is more similar to a combo car/truck .What made me want to buy one in the first place was outstanding warranty and appearance of the Sorento and have been very happy . I would recommend this car to everyone interested .",,
4,Very Jeep-like,Anthony ,05/21/2016,4,4,4,,,4,5,4,5,,,"Despite some short comings, I like this SUV.Pros: 4WD, space and comfort, good cargo room, good engine power, great traction. 127600 miles on the odo and still on the original spark plugs and suspension!Cons:An annoying rattle that no one can find. We have been over the SUV with a fine toothed comb, MANY times and cannot find the rattle.Very sensitive accelerator. Thirsty V-6 engine, but who buys a 4WD SUV for the MPGs? Owner's manual states that 87 octane gas/petrol is minimum. That is a lie! This vehicle needs 89 and if you want it running right, it needs premium fuel. I have been using premium for years and never had a problem. When I used 87 or 89, the engine knocks, pings and becomes very hesitant. Engine has always had an annoying whining when starting and accelerating, but it does not cause any problems.Get any other color than bright silver. For some reason people tend not to see it! I have had to stick red and white reflectors on the bumper and back door to increase its visibility for other drivers. Brakes have always been too soft, even when new. Stopping distance is long so brake accordingly.",,

This car has been a solid work horse for me.I've had to have it in for just one service that I wouldn't be considered wear and tear, and that was when a sensor went out at about 4mon and essentially meant the gas pedal wouldn't work.Apart from that, it's been the usual things that happen to a 6 year old car that has 100k on the clock.","This has been a dog hauling vehicle.
I can fit my two SUV sized crates in the car.
It offered the best size and value. Any other car with this kind of capacity would have cost another 6k+, or I'd have had to go for a minivan. It's comfortable, has a firm ride (I prefer that as a 'boaty' feeling makes me sick).
Good solid array of entry level features and is surprisingly solid in snowy/icy weather for a RWD vehicle.","Gas mileage, yeah, it sucks.
I downloaded an App and started recording the $/# and found it to be 15/21 downhill, with the wind behind me, sticking firmly to the speed limits.
High speed and A/C will kill that mileage. An additional cup holder in the front doors would be handy and I'd really like to see a compass in the mirror as standard. The road noise is high, but I recently found my friend's Ford to be much higher, so I guess it's not so bad."

I started haveing a problem with the car when I would crank it of a morning it sounded like the motor was gonna come out of the car.

I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing, as the HARD shift and the passenger air bag comments would have alerted me I might not be happy with the choice. I have lost my faith in this car due to the transmission issues, and am looking at trading it in. ","The profile compared to other mid range SUV's is a plus.

4.375,This vehicle has been great,jacobe ,05/13/2011,,,4,4,5,5,,5,3,5,4,"Okay the problems that people have been stating are easily solved. The rattling in the trunk, its the jack in the back, simply put a towl back there with it, the back seat trim is just to cover the hinges on the seat. They are not that important, and the airbag sensor in the passenger seat is working the way it should be, you just have to sit in the seat the correct way. Now to the car its self. It has been great 70k and no troubles at all. I do have to say though the transmission does shift hard sometimes but its not that big of a deal. Great power from the engine, it does suck up the gas though. Overal it is an excelent reliable car to have.","The engines power, easy to maintain yourself.","Ride quality, fuel economy."

For example, so-so MPG,the passenger air bag sensor, brake rotors, hard shifting transmission (intermittent), rear differential failure and a front, testy transmission when in 4WD and recurring right side axle seal leak. These are problems which should be handled under warranty by any KIA dealer. Unfortunately, that is not the way the company does business. If you get lousy service at one dealer, you should be able to go to another dealer for service without problems. Not so with KIA. Let the buyer beware! Also if you miss any of the recommended services, they won't honor the warranty if any parts are adversely affected, even if the part just went bad on its own! KIA is extreme with their maintenance recommendations and timeliness of the services. Also be very careful when buying in the showroom. Every dealer is trained in HIGH PRESSURE sales/scare tactics. Don't allow them to pressure you into buying a car that you don't want. A ""similar"" vehicle is not the ""same"" vehicle that you want. Brush up on your haggling and bargaining skills and be prepared o walk out if you can't reach an agreement.","4WD, comfort, power, room.","Better fuel economy and better service without all the company ""red tape"" and runarounds."

After much research and prayer, I bought my '08 Sorento with 7000 miles on it. Got a great price, but was apprehensive about the name. I have driven it daily for over a year and have had NO problems of any kind. I spoke at length with a Kia mechanic and he told me the '08s and later were much better designed and were on par with Toyota quality--without the price tag. I have found that to be true. Love the powerful V6 engine, sporty body style, and handling. I does ride a bit rough, as it is on an SUV frame, but I already knew it would so it doesn't bother me.

They couldn't seem to find the source of the vibration. They replaced a couple of computers; then the transmission,then a module,etc.  The vibration is better but still not as quiet as a new car should be. We get about 18/19 mpg. No seat belt light issue at all.The dealership has  gone above and beyond to please us,but they now say this is not uncommon in the 2008 model. Why didn't they say that when we first complained?

4.75,Passenger side air bag issues,redmymail2 ,10/26/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"My Kia is fun to drive, handles like a dream, I just wish the passenger side airbag sensor light wouldn't come on when there is someone in the seat. I too have had the seat repaired only to have the light come on again. My service tech has recommended that I call Kia directly to ask for help.  The 5 star crash test rating, a main reason for buying the Kia, obviously doesn't account for a defective sensor. I would heartily recommend the vehicle to anyone if not for this issue.","Ease of entry, visibility, 21 gallon fuel tank, seat comfort and spaciousness.  Turning radius, feels solid and sure on the road.",Recall the airbag sensor in the passenger seat. Find a way to fix it so I can truly enjoy my can and feel comfortable having a co-pilot.
4.875,Happy new owner,Seibs ,10/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Took delivery of vehicle in the morning, and took a 250+ mile trip in the afternoon - mostly freeway in hilly country. Got 22/5 MPG. Traded in 1997 Pathfinder - much the same size vehicle. Having a super time with the manual control of the automatic tranny. Vehicle is so quiet, and great fun to drive. So far, best choice of car ever made -- and the price was definitely right",Manual tranny control. And just the right size SUV. Not big hunkin truck,Exterior temp indicator
4.875,Good deal,Ravi ,09/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I was looking for a car with value for my money. I didn't want to spend a load of money on features which are attractive but after a while we don't use it. Kia Sorento was perfect in my budget and the other accessories i was looking for. So far the car is running absolutely fine. ,Simple yet elegant. Interior space is enough for five passengers. Long drive doesn't seem tiring.,Mileage could be improved. Engine noise can be reduced.
4.5,Traded in Expedition,Jay Gillette ,09/03/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"I traded in a Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer with all the toys so please keep this in mind when I compare to my new Sorento EX with leather, sunroof, 6 cd, etc. Gas: The Expedition was getting an average of about 16-17 mpg. Thus far the Kia is getting 21-22 mpg for the same daily route taken to home/work. Space: It is lacking with comparison to the Expedition however is very consistent with a mid size SUV. They could have added about 4-6 inches in length to the cargo area to better round out the car, (I think the test should be to fit an average baby stroller in straight with having to put it sideways.) The front has plenty of room for me and I am above average in size, same for the passenger.","Solid feel, look & style",Cross bars that fit the 08 model. Longer cargo area to fit average stroller.
4.875,Great for the Money!,Armtek ,07/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Sorento EX replaced a 2005 Mercury Mountaineer Premier. We wanted better gas mileage and smaller size SUV (no more hauling around gaggles of girls sports teams). Only gave up 3rd row seat (which we wanted to do anyway), passenger power seat adjustment/lumbar support (which would be bad but the seats are very comfortable), and a little on the stereo quality (but we are rectifying that with an aftermarket nav/sound next month). Comfort is very good, fit/finish is very good, ride is very good and stable (plus we can get our favorite Goodyear Tripletred tires for it). Performance was much better than expected, with the 3.8l V-6 really pushing the Sorento better than our older V-8 SUV.","Power, and lots of it! No wimpy on-ramp events with this vehicle! Also, more power at this altitude (CO) does help with economy (underpowered vehicles just don't cut it).","Passenger seat power adjustments, fold-down rear seats, OEM nav system option, more storage under rear deck (like Santa Fe)"
4,"Not bad, could be better",Looking to trade ,06/30/2008,,,4,5,3,4,,4,4,4,4,"I traded a sedan for the Sorento.  I use it to transport bikes and dogs (one of which is a 75 lb. Greyhound) and commute to work.  I wanted a vehicle that sat higher than a car and had plenty of cargo room. I drive combined city/highway and get 22.5 mpg. I've had trouble with the passenger airbag-my brother (140 lb.) has ridden with me and one minute the airbag sensor screen shows it's on, then a few minutes later it's off.  Doesn't exactly make you feel safe. There's a rattle (already) on the driver's side that the dealership fixed, then a few weeks later it came back. ","The look of the exterior, cargo room, plenty of power, console layout (I use the little change drawers a lot). I live in a windy area and it does surprisingly well. I love the tire pressure monitoring system. Good for those who don't always notice a tire that's a little low. Warranty. Decent mpg. ",Some materials feel cheap. I can feel a spring in the driver's seat (and I'm not that big-140 lb.). Rear seats need to fold completely flat. Passenger air bag needs to actually work. The rear door could be difficult for short/weak upper body strength people to close. 
4.25,Had this as a rental for one month,Joe ,06/13/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,2,4,"This SUV is quick.  It revs high and will throw you back in your seat when you get on the gas.  The ride is very smooth even over bumpy brick roads I've been on.  I took in on a 200+ mile road trip and was very comfortable.  The stock stereo system isn't bad and would be adequate for most people.  It's really a sharp looking SUV, the inside isn't Lexus or Mercedes fancy, but if you're not trying to impress everyone with your fancy car, then who cares?  I've carried up to 8 people in this thing, of course, two were in the seatless trunk area.  Seats fold down real nice to make a ton of cargo room.  Definitely a good family hauler, would be great for long roadies or just tooling around town.","Strong engine, auto stick, comfort, high profile tires that eat up bumps, nice rims, nice overall appearance, good visibility.","The gas mileage is TERRIBLE!!!  I'm an aggressive driver and I got 13 mpg mixed driving on one tank.  The next tank was on my road trip, had the cruise set at 75 mph on the highway and I got 16.8 mpg.  I think if you feather footed it you might get 16/18.  Steering wheel is real sensitive!"
1.75,Broke KIA,Steve ,06/12/2008,,,2,2,1,1,,2,2,2,2,"The main problem I have with this vehicle is the passenger seat airbag. I have had numerous problems with my passenger seat air bag and with five trips to the dealership it still has not been fixed. Now they say it is not working because my wife does not weigh enough, and with her just over 100 pounds I find that hard to believe. Simply stated the vehicle is junk, and they have no regards to our safety by not fixing it. ",Starbucks Coffee machine at dealership. I have used it a lot with the service waits I have had.  ,Fix the airbags. 
4.375,Bang for the Buck Truck,Rodney Allen ,04/29/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,3,4,"After looking at lots of V6 midsized SUVs, I bought an `08 Sorento LX two weeks ago and have been very happy with it--once I tracked down a rattle up front and a chain-like jingle coming from somewhere in the rear. The rattle was caused by the garage door opener compartment. I fixed it by putting two washcloths in it, which put some pressure on the plastic door, as well as providing some sound baffling. The chain-like jingle was coming from the latch on the rear hatch. Some silicone lubricant put an end to that. With those initial annoyances out of the way, I was free to enjoy the refined character of the Sorento--great looks, good performance, unmatched value. This truck is a real deal.","The LX Sport and Leather Packages, with the black-on-black interior. I prefer the LX to the EX because the sunroof in the EX takes up too much headroom for my 6'3'' frame, and I also don't like the EX cladding or the chrome door handles. My silver exterior and black leather interior look great.","Better mileage, power seat on LX, slightly longer and softer seats, outside temp gauge, IPod jack on stereo, lock on fuel door. But at $5000 less than the Mazda CX-7, or the Rav4 with a V6, and the great warranty, the Sorento's faults are trivial. This SUV has many, many great qualities you'll love."
4.875,Best Value SUV,Todd Roberson ,03/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My wife and I just purchased our 2008 Kia Sorento. We had a 2006 Nissan Murano and was overwhelmed by the Sorento quality and price. We was able to upgrade to the top of the line including DVD, leather, sunroof etc. We took a couple of days to decide but that's just because of the color of the vehicle (midnight Blue /gray) and we could not be happier with our decision. Key issues was the turning ratio, torque, comfort and style of the exterior and interior. No complaints!","Color options, comfort and style",Have not found any complaints as of yet. MPG is rated 22 hwy about avg for a suv. Only complaint is the price of fuel and last I checked KIA doesn't own a oil rig.
4.625,This is a great SUV for the money,Christopher ,02/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"I love my Sorento. The gas mileage is abysmal. Once you get over that, and the fact that the stereo is a bit weak, it is terrific in all other respects. It is very well put together with intuitive controls, an attractive interior, great seats, nice exterior design, nice wheels and terrific paint quality. I also like that they don't try to make this a seven seater but instead are very thoughtful with the storage area and add'l storage throughout. If Kia could get a better stereo, nav option and work on the gas mileage, this would be the best SUV in its class.","Interior layout, exterior looks.","Gas mileage, stereo quality and design."
