4.25,Nissan Altima hybrid,Bruce D ,07/01/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,4,4,"I've only had my car for 3 weeks, but so far so good.  One of the big benefits is the roominess.  I'm 6'5'' tall, and I have lots of leg room. The car has surprising power for a hybrid.  ",,
5,"Perfect blend of MPG, ride, room, looks",PalosVerdes ,06/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Perfect.  More room, power, fun to drive, and literally bang for the buck than the other Hybrids (Camry, Civic, Prius).  With its five star crash ratings, my wife and I feel just as safe as in our Mercedes which we now leave parked in the garage.  I have let Civic and Prius owners drive my Altima and they were surprised by the power and handling.   ",I'm hooked on the keyless locks and start - no more fiddling with keys.  Plenty of cupholders and bins.  Relatively quick acceleration and passing power.  Sporty road handling. 36MPG city/hwy on regular unleaded,Allow the driver to control when to switch from battery to gas power.
4.875,Finally green,Carlsbad ,06/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Just bought our first hybrid and so far it has been outstanding.  After driving a dodge durango for a few years (17 mpg on a good day) it's nice to finally have a car that gives a little back.  Great handling, quiet ride, smooth acceleration, and great gas mileage. Looked at other vehicles in same class, Altima won us over mostly due to it's sporty styling and smooth ride.  Highly recommend this car to anyone. One more thing, in your instruction manual it states that there are three instances which your engine will run automatically.  They are engine warm-up, batt charging and high or low batt temp. ",It's a hybrid,"Wife wants blinkers on side mirrors, Xenon highlights.  And maybe a super charger.  haha"
5,Very Happy Thank You,Jane ,06/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I gave up my 2003 Honda Camry in Jan 08 for the( in my opinion)sexy Altima Hybrid. I don't regret it. I drive 50 miles to and from work 6 days a week. I went from 3 tanks of gas a month to 3tanks of gas every 2 months. I went to San francisco from L A and drove around all week on the same tank of gas . With the camry I had to fill up when I got to San Francisco.  I am Very Happy Thank You.,"I have one with navigation, leather, sunroof. ",I am very happy just the way it is.
4.75,Hybrid Review,AFM ,06/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,I purchased the car expecting around 35 mpg. I am at 700 miles and haven't gotten better than 26- 29 mpg. I have to drive for a couple of miles before the ev mode engages. I can even be at a stop and it won't kick in. I expected the ev mode to be on more. It seems the gas engine is always on. I drive 4 miles to work all city driving. I am over half way there before the ev mode comes on. I would have never purchased the car if i am going to get 26-29 mpg especially at this pricepoint.,Interior is very comfortable.,Redesign the rear tail lights.
5,Super,Herc95 ,06/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded an Infiniti G35X in on my Altima.  I drive approx. 100 miles per day, mostly highway.  I used to stop twice a week or more to fill up with Premium unleaded.  I now stop less than once per week.  I am averaging over 36 miles per gallon, this is with setting the cruise on the highway portion at 73- 74.  What a money and time saver.  Enjoyable and fun to drive.",Tech package is great.

Maybe the battery needs to charge up? Go on freeway no ev. Get off near work, I go 20mph through the alley, slightest acceleration it goes to gas. computer says I'm getting 31mpg. But it also shows my avg mph at 30 when I drive almost entirely freeway at 80 mph. Drives nice though. Fast and peppy.",Push button keyless starter and entry. Bluetooth ,Shouldn't go out of ev even when accelerating until you reach 30 or 40 mph. Needs electric adjusting passenger seat. Would be Nice if passenger could program navi when driving.
4.875,The most practical & powerfull hybrid,Victor ,05/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I agree, it becomes a game to try and keep the vehicle in electric mode to maximize gas mileage. The worst mileage so far is 32 when my son drove it, nuff said, and the best is my driving at 39.6 MPG. Being a survivor of the gas crisis and the long lines for gas in the seventies, the great range is something I was really looking for. Additionally this car will move out quite smartly when you step on it. They have improved on the Toyota system and the CVT is very smooth.","The looks, the size, the mileage, the range, the battery warranty (150,000 ten years), the power and the smooth transmission.",Make the ride softer.

Like the way the machine can get out of its own way when you need it to move fast.  I do wish it would stay in electric mode to a higher speed.  Fit and trim is excellent, leather trim is good as is interior.  Car should have come with fog lights, but that is a small gripe to an otherwise really good driving experience, wish I had the money to replace my second car with another one.","Mileage, fit and trim, power ",Smoother switch from electric and gas modes.

5,"My ""Tuna Can""",LiaDesiree ,05/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Well, folks, traded in my Mercedes S Class to go green.  Haven't regretted it, yet. This car is stylish, has great pickup, and tons of features that my Merz didn't have (XM radio, backup camera). Bought car and immediately drove it to So. California. Found I was doing 85-90 mph and didn't know it. Still got 32 MPG without battery assistance. Looked at Camry also, but Altima won, hands down, for style, comfort and options. Nissan warranties their battery for 150K miles. Got all the bells and whistles on this baby: tech package, etc. ","Great gas mileage. Averaging 34-37 MPG around town. I like the nav system, and Bluetooth is better than in my Merz. Comfortable seats, roomy interior.","Bigger trunk. Power passenger seats & memory for both front seats. Mute button, guys!! Fog lights should be standard with upgrades. Hate how voice control repeats stored numbers..waste of time! Transmission drops power when shifting & battery-to-gas shift can be rough."

One NAH 7 weeks old, 1300 miles got 35.8 actual mpg on second fill up (trip computer had 38.3, but they are always higher than actual)  More stop and go & suburban miles.  Other NAH 6 weeks old, over 5000 miles, mostly highway driving getting between 33 and 35 mpg.  ","Fob for starting car, just keep in pocket or purse.  20 gallon tank means you can get close to 700 miles between fill ups.  Fun to drive -- almost a ""game"" trying to keep in EV mode for as long as possible.","Too much interior noise, as a result bluetooth on one of my vehicles virtually worthless as people cannot underestand when I try to use it.

This is a very comfortable car.  The Tech package is great as is the rear view camera. Nissan took Toyota technology and improved upon it. The engine starts feel no different than a shift in a typical car. Very happy!   ","Fuel economy, bluetooth, audio system, nav unit, surprisingly good feedback in steering. This is the better Toyota hybrid. Nissan engineers (motor, eCVT) adaptation of Toyota Synergy drive is very impressive. They have a winner.",Trunk size. Very usable but small. Right side passenger seat should be electronic (comfortable). Fog lights and Xenon option. And no ABS/TCS/VSC off switch (required in winter to get up my hill) that I can find. 
5,The Camry Killer?,andrew ,04/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Although we test-drove the Prius and Camry Hybrid, the Altima was the only full hybrid we actually found fun to drive; it's responsive and powerful, and feels like a performance car rather than a boat or oversized cart. While the jury is still out on gas economy (it was a cold winter in Toronto, after all), it's still pretty good.  Couple that with its attractive exterior, and I would have to say that the Altima is the best hybrid out there right now.","Moon roof, keyless ignition, performance.","Options packages for Canadian purchasers, auto shutoff if users leave car in idle for 5 minutes or more."

I suppose dealer never filled it quite full like I do.  Second vehicle with convenience package but not tech.  Love the backup, nav system, very quiet with roof open, but, still, a poor bluetooth system too much road noise or background noise people cannot hear me clearly.  Also, love that I can keep key in pocket never take it out.  Same for my wife leaving it in purse.  Less chance of misplacing.  Oh well, out of room just about!","Get up and go!  Excellent gas mileage and long range between fillups.  Nav system different than my Tribeca, some pros, (different views) but some features I miss (calculator, ability to scroll screen while driving).","Do not like at all the way you have to keep pushing buttons to see various mpg info.  Also that you have to delete two items at the same time, not just one.  I would like to keep running avg mpg but you can't do that without changing miles driven"
5,The ultimate hybrid driving machine,sd1 ,04/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I used to own the 1997 Nissan Altima -- it had a strong engine and acceleration but wasn't as refined. Boy, has the Altima come of age. It now has effortless acceleration and very good ride/handling with modest vibrations and cabin noise. It can now hold its own against the Mercedes C series, and win with a bigger interior and better mpg.

5,I love this car!,Pleased owner ,03/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my Altima 6 months ago and have not regretted my decision once.  I bought the fully equipped Technology package and I have found the features included comparable with cars costing significantly more.  I am getting a consistent 33-35 mpg with about 50-50 highway/street driving.  I have not experienced any issues at all, not even a minor squeak or rattle.  I must say that I love this car!!  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a hybrid that still feels and looks sporty.",Backup camera; bluetooth phone hookup; keyless entry; going 600 miles between refueling.,More trunk room (I know this is tough with a hybrid).

Perhaps because I always fill to the brim, dealer probably when they gave full tank not quite full.  Great pickup nav system a bit complicated, but aren't they all?  Nav should have built in calculator. Negatives - too much road (wind) noise.  Bluetooth does not work real well, people have hard time hearing me on phone, plus voice recognition doesn't work so well. Have with tech package - should come with fog lights standard although lighting at nite pretty good, can manage without them.  Trunk small, but will manage.  Also purchased 2nd NAH this week for wife (without tech package).","Didn't realize I had more room so will add a bit more.  Great gas mileage also with large tank will go far.  On second fillup went 585 miles, used 18 gallons.  Great pickup, smooth ride.  Love features in nav screen.","Too much road noise!  Fog lights should be standard.  Voice recognition not so great.

4.75,Sporty Hybrid, New Owner ,03/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"We purchased this car less than a month ago and so far, the mileage, comfort, drive are as expected. It does have a sporty feel and except for the sudden and slight jolt when switching transmissions, it is fun to drive and wonderful to know you are helping the environment. A surprise: if car hasn't been driven for awhile, the gasoline engine comes on for a min. or two when you least expect it, when you first start car, or when idling at a stop sign or red light. It stays on for a min. or two and if still idling, goes back to EV mode.  Thus, not always the quiet experience we were told about. Perhaps it is the cold weather.","Tech pkg. is full of comforts including leather, heated seats. Back reading lights, and air vents are a plus.  More head room for driver than in Camry; great sound.","The fact the the 'gasoline engine' comes on when car is idling tells me it is not as energy efficient as it could be. Continue to improve the MPG. Also, the dome lights at front are too bright to keep on for too long a period."
4.5,Like it better than Camry Hybrid,Engineer ,02/14/2008,,,4,5,5,4,,5,4,5,4,"Have owned a Prius 4 years, wife wanted larger more comfortable hybrid. Drove Camry and Altima. Very close overall, but Altima seemed a little more ""user friendly"".  Liked Altima styling, engine power, displays, controls better.  Camry had more cup holders and pockets.  Altima seemed to have a more usable trunk, even tho Camry spec listed larger.  Love backup camera, sun/moon roof, keyless entry/startup, bluetooth hands free calling.  Quiet on highway, excellent handling, acceleration.  Got 35 mpg first tank (575 miles), mostly freeway driving.  Get the Tech Pkg!",Mid sized sedan gets 35 mpg! Great gadgets and comfort features.  Smooth quiet acceleration.,Miles to empty changed to warning with over 4 gals left in tank.  Nissan should reprogram display to start complaining with 2 gals left - still over 60 miles left to find fuel.  Add memory seats to Tech Package.
4.25,So Far So Good,Jeff in Sacramento ,01/12/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,5,5,4,"This is a totally solid and surprisingly sporty hybrid. Mileage is as advertised; I get 32-33 mpg with no change at all of my rather speedy driving habits. We are very pleased with the purchase, esp. considering the tax credit. The smaller trunk is not as bad as we expected - a stroller fits easily, as does my golf bag (esp. if I remove my driver first). ","Gas mileage is great, esp. With the large gas tank and only regular unleaded needed. Nav is semi-helpful, but the screen is great. Love the keyless entry (wish my house was so handy).","Only annoyance is lack of memory seats (wife is 5'2"" and I'm 6'1""). "
4.375,NEW OWNER,TIM ,01/11/2008,,,5,4,4,4,,5,5,4,4,bought the car last month. happy so far gas mpg is in 34-37 range per tank. transmission shifts are a bit jumpy from elect. to gas.  hwy  speeds the car tends to surge slightly. would buy the car again.,tec package,needs to come with fog lights. smother shifting.
4.25,A+ on mileage:  B- on interior design ,ccdeblaze ,01/02/2008,,,3,4,4,5,,5,4,5,4,"Mileage rocks. We bought it last week and immediately took it on a road trip. Got 300 miles on a little more than half a tank. Handles well, pretty comfy-- (I'm spoiled by the old Lexus I had before). Bells and whistles that come with the tech package are pretty cool. I rented a Prius for a few days awhile back and the Altima ride is far (far!) superior. Better kick, more comfort, and better than average looks.","Bluetooth wireless phone, dual heat for passenger and driver. Nav system. Gratifying little display screens that tell me how much gas I'm using/saving. Extra entertainment value offered by car sensors that know my key/fob is nearby.","No flat interior surfaces to place phone or iPod. While there are THREE cupholders, remaining interior storage for empty mugs, combs, small toys, spare keys and other  detritus is harder to access.

4.75,No Surprises,Jack ,12/24/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I have only had this car about a month so I can't say it is broken in by any means and the temperature has been below freezing most of the time. This car meets all my expectations and then some. I was concerned about reading about the ""shudder"" transition from electric to gas but I found that only noticable at a full stop and not a problem. While driving it is smooth and responsive. I can't wait for  warmer weather. On my first tank I hit about 34 mpg which is about the current EPA. I expect in warmer weather that it will improve. Got the tech package and I am glad I did. Seats are a big improvement over the standard cloth.

4.875,Cool looking hybrid,Ken ,12/17/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was looking for a midsize hybrid, so I choose the Altima over the Toyota Camry, due to the sporty body style. But the ride is just awesome. If you are looking for a mid size sedan with good gas milage, handling and acceleration, this is it. Not to mention, I got 600 miles on the first tank of fue l(75% hwy). But keep in mind, the gas tank holds 17 gallons. My previous car was a Corolla, so I was not used to buying 17 gallons at every fill up. In closing, if you want a cool looking car and do your little part in saving the planet and be less dependant on foreign oil, consider buying the Nissan Altima Hybrid. ","Navi system, bluetooth, XM radio, garage door button on the rear view mirror, rear bumper camera, aux. input for my ipod. The Technology package is expensive, but I truly love it.","Include fog lights with tech. package for hybrid model. Also,the ""wood grain"" panels are not wood (looks real  cheap).

Got about 500+ miles on first tank (I drive about 50/50 highway/city).  Traded in 2006 Acura TL - when premium gas hit $3.49/gallon was glad I didn't own it anymore!  Horsepower is more than sufficient - not nearly the oomph of the TL, but no problems at all passing or merging into traffic.  Quiet, safe, smooth and comfortable ride.

The day we got it, we drove from Philadelphia to DC for the weekend and back.  total miles 300, half a tank of gas.  Car is great, and best part is the button start and everything is totally quiet in the car.  I can go on and on, but the bottom line is we compared it to the Camry, and we liked this one better.  We got the Metallic Jade (green), so we have a true green car in more than one way!","Push start, nav and hands free phone, when the car start, outside of the dashboard indicator there is no other noise or sound.","Trunk space.  If the camry can have a bigger trunk with folding back seets, the Altima should have it too.  Since this car is driven to work and back it is not an issue.

We have the sunroof and Tech package.  It is a fun car to drive and the price and tax benefits are better than the Toyota Camry Hybrid.  After driving the Audi S4, we were wondering about the feel of the hybrid, but so far, the acceleration is great and with the money that we save over MTC of the Audi and 50% better fuel, this car will pay itself off in tree years.","Navigation with live traffic, bluetooth, push start with no engine noise, fuel consumption.","Trunk could be bigger.  Nice to have would be memory driver seat & radio settings, power passenger seat, and power tilt/telescopic attached to the memory settings of the car.
