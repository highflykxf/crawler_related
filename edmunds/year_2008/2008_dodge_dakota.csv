3.125,Great Concept. Bad build. Too heavy and sluggish.,nclemons1985 ,02/26/2014,,,4,4,3,3,,3,3,2,3,"I Loved Dakotas. I owned a 94 4WD 3.9L V6 Dakota. Really fun to drive. Great size. In 2004 I purchased a 2000 4.7L V8 4WD Dakota. I recently sold it with 170,000 miles. It still ran great. My favorite year for Dakotas. Last year I purchased a 2008 4WD Dakota with the 4.7L. I traded it in 4 months later for a new RAM. They upgraded the 4.7L to 302 hp yet it is slower than my 00 Dakota. The 08 is to heavy. Defeats the purpose of mid size or small size truck. The ground clearance is too low. The 4WD is stiff; in addition the turning radius in 4WD is as bad as I have ever experienced in a truck. The truck is almost unbearable to drive off road. The suspension is too weak to carry the weight ",The truck looks nice. The exterior is slick. I also appreciated the interior of the truck. A lot of room in the Crew Cab. Overall the looks of the truck inside and out were good. The 4.7L is a amazing motor. It is my second one. They will run for a long time and produce alot of power for that size engine. However it is not enough for a truck as heavy as the 2008 Crew Cab Dakota. ,"Since the Dakota has been discontinued suggestions, and improvements are pointless. However I loved the concept of a V8 in smaller trucks. I do not enjoy the weight of the 08 Dakota however. Made it sluggish. The 4WD needs improvement. My suggestion for buyers that have already purchased a 08 or newer Dakota is trade it in for a new Ram. It is twice the truck with better gas mileage and equal price. If Dodge decides to make another small or mid size truck I would suggest taking lessons from the 2000-2004 Models. They were the perfect truck. "
4.625,Update to previous rating,Dale ,10/30/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Since last review with wiring problems, I've had my Dakota on two out of state trips, and pull a 2800 lb. boat and trlr. fishing. I now trust my truck. I'll do 72 on highway pulling boat with a/c on. May turn off air on big hills. I can get 19mpg when using cruise, which surprised me since I have a steady foot. Plan on getting 265 tires, from the 245 stocked next spring if it's no issue. I also plan on getting another warranty, I have lifetime drivetrain, but will research because know how business can be. They'd rather tell you to sue, it's about money. Don't know any other truck that will fit in garage, with the power, Toyota can't be trusted now. Waiting for wagon etc. with power, mileage.","Sirius, power seats etc. upper console, comfort, huge engine, rated mileage using cruise. Handling, braking mech. all good. Quiet enough inside.","I'd prefer full time 4WD with mech. engage. Steering can be a little numb on highway, but it does handle well. Would like pop out cup holders like 05 Ram. Needs a double glove box like Nissan, lose the upper storage above glove box. Side air bags. I guess 2012 will lose the real truck for unibody, yuk"
3,Break downs,MD ,02/03/2010,,,2,4,3,3,,4,4,1,3,"Like my 2008 Dodge, Several time turn in for minor thing while under warr. Radio clock doesn't work, been reset about 6 times, gave up on turning it in to get fixed. Got 37,400 miles on it and rack and pinon when out along with power steering pump, $1,740 to fix it.  Gas mileage average 16 to 18 on open highway, 3.7 6 cyl. with no load, pulling small boat, around 1,350 pounds, about 12 to 14 miles a gallon. Power on 3.7 is low, will not stay in overdrive going up small hills. Second Dodge Dakota I own. Warr should be better, keep oil change and maintenance back the book, if you go over 60 miles pass oil change, warr. is void. Turn mine in and had 12 miles before void warr.","Ride nice, looks good","Fuel, no 20 on open highway at 65 or 70 no load. Maybe 18 at best 2 wheel drive. Better warr. "

4.25,2nd dakota,bluedak ,12/18/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,5,4,4,5,"Bought this 08 crew cab to replace my 01 ext. Cab due to growing family. I loved my 01, and this one is starting to grow on me. The new 4.7 has much more power than the prior version. I have 28k on the truck, and no mechanical problems yet. I guess my 2 gripes with the 08 are the interior feels a little cheap (few rattles from arm rest and more plasticky overall than my 01). And the 05 to current dakotas sit too low to the ground, esp. Compared to Tacoma and frontier. But I like it overall and would buy my 3rd Dakota in the future. Mpg 16-17 in mixed driving, similar to my 01 4.7, except with about 70 more hp.","like the optional bed rails w/ tiedowns,the new 4.7 power, the ride is good,interior space and visibility from the quad cab are excellent. good access to carseat in back.like the inferno red color, too. decent mpg for v8.","stance too low for a truck, smallish stock tires for a 4x4 truck (245's),cheap feeling interior, although i find the seats pretty comfy.tpms is a little too sensitive. light will come on if it goes 1lb of pressure below the recommended psi."
4.5,Lots of Power,Hoodoo74 ,11/19/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,3,4,5,"I bought this truck in January 2009 just before Chrysler went under.  Like many truck guys I'm very brand loyal for better or worse.  This is the third Dakota that I've owned and I've always liked the mid-size handling and the available V8 power.  In those areas, the truck doesn't disappoint - acceleration and handling are impressive.  The new V8 and the 5 speed automatic seem well suited to each other. The interior, like all past Dakotas, seems to be cheaply made though I've never had anything break off or not work.  Maybe it's just me but the optional heated bucket seats are like riding on a piece of 2x12 - next to no cushion at all which is a pain in the butt (literally) on long trips. ","V8 power, 5 spped transmission, 3.92 rear end, tight handling, reliability, good towing package, sporty looks","terrible bucket seats (maybe the bench is better?), when will the truck get rear disc brakes?, cheap interior, find a better way for the driver to shut off the change oil warning message rather than flicking the ignition switch on and off and pumping the gas pedal (no overhead console in my truck)"
3.875,Transmision and Fan problems,Charles ,11/05/2009,,,5,5,1,1,,5,5,4,5,"The first night I owned the vehicle I started it and the Variable Speed Fan was locked up.  It roared like an 18 wheeler.  Then came the transmission problem. When coming to a stop, at 25 MPH the transmission dropped into low gear and jolted the whole vehicle. Many trips to dealer never resolved these problems. Tech says fan problem is normal!!! I got rid of it at 28,900 miles.  The decision was made solely due to the problems with the vehicle.","I liked the design, ride and comfort.  I disliked having repeat problems especially with the transmission.  The Final Straw was when the dealer's technician (Chapman Dodge) said nothing was wrong with the transmission. Tech says Differential is SHATTERING, needs an oil change every 15k miles.",Build a more reliable vehicle; concentrate on quality.  Fix it when it has a problem; don't try to get it past warranty and dump the cost of repair on the buyer.
4.875,Awesome Truck,EMT Ryan ,08/11/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I was looking for a nice truck that was fully loaded, but wasn't too large. After comparing all of the models available, I noticed that the smaller, almost car-sized trucks were comparable to price of the Dakota. After taking it for a quick test drive, I immediately noticed that the V6 Magnum had the power that could be used if needed. Great interior - almost nice enough to be considered luxury - and all the features you could ask for. Great ride all in all. I average 18-22mpg combined, which isn't too bad for a truck this size. Towed my 16 foot, 1500lb boat with no effort. Nice stock stereo system. New design for the exterior makes the truck look much nicer. Great truck for the money!",Interior and exterior looks. Extended cab is nice for storing - no need for toolbox in bed. Comfortable ride. Wouldn't mind taking it on long trips. Powerful V6. Just an overall great truck. Wouldn't change it.,"None, other than improving the MPG on gas by a few points."
4.875,Best overall mid-sized truck.,Nice Truck ,01/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I wanted a truck that wasn't too big, but had enough grunt to work. Love the space the crew cab gives, wish the bed was about 1' longer. 4.7 V-8 is a great engine in search of a decent transmission. Very slow to down shift, yet won't up-shift in parking lots. 4X4 knob is in a poor location. Ride is a bit too stiff--the 07 was too soft. Handling is terrific for a truck, but I would trade a bit of handling for a less stiff ride. So far 14 mpg city 21 mpg highway, pretty decent for a 300+ HP V-8 4X4. Overall head and shoulders above the Ranger and Colorado, better looking than Toyota and Nissan. Best mid-sized truck out there","Comfortable seats, V-8 has plenty of power and is smooth and quiet. Perfect size, roomy interior, neat storage bins under rear seat. ","Loosen the suspension just a bit, a 6-speed automatic that responds quicker, put some sound insulation in the roof--way too much wind noise.  ."
4.875,Great truck,Tom ,01/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I reseached this purchase before spending $27K, and nothing compared to the value received in the Dakota. Oh yes, all the magazines love Toyota and Nissan, however, these same magazines receive a heck of a lot more incentives from these manufacturers for the positive take. This Dodge is every bit as good, more powerful, more capable and better looking. Take advantage of all the incentives, compare, and you'll come to the same conclusion---Buy it! You won't be sorry.","Powerful V8, interior room, comfortable/quiet, towing capability.",None---great as it is.
5,Great Truck,builder04 ,12/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my 3rd truck in 5 years, and I must say my favorite.  I bought the v6 because I drive so much and its better on gas.  Love the looks of this truck, and the interior is like a luxury car.  Never liked the exterior of the Dakota till the 08 came out. They are giving 08's away, mine was 10k off MSRP. The quad cab is very roomy, drives and handles way better than my 06 Titan.  This is the top of the small truck class.  I looked at and test drove a Canyon Z71 and a Nismo Frontier, and I was surprised that I liked The Dakota so much better. ","Big Horn edition looks are amazing. Love the interior seating, back seats fold up to reveal storage slots, awesome feature.  The front end is a much better improvement from Dakota's of past. Bluetooth standard is pretty cool.",30k dollar trucks should come with bedliners. Had a very dificult time getting a sliding rear window put in after purchase.  If the bed was a 1' longer this would be a perfect truck
4.375,Great Value and Rebates,Great Value ,11/22/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,3,4,"I was in the market for a pick-up and researched for a year.  Settled on the Dodge Dakota with V8. I like the size and power.  Meets my needs for a vehicle that supports my fly fishing, weekend camping, towing small trailer. I bought for Sport Crew Cab with V8 for $26,800, freight and tax included.  Sticker was close to $34K.  Bought at $1000 under invoice, plus Dodge is offering factory $5000 rebate on 08 Crew Cabs.","Not too big, not too small. Great V8 power. 310 HP, 329 lbs of torque. Yet I'm getting 18 mpg on highway, which is not bad for a V8.  Note that 2008 V8 has 2 spark plugs per cylinder, and gets as good as mileage as most V6s. Go for the power, baby!  Heated seats are great. MyGig stereo with VR",Perhaps a long bed option.
4.75,Dakota truck,Dale ,11/21/2008,,,5,5,5,3,,5,5,5,5,"Having done the research for a bigger engine to pull with, I decided on the SLT, V8, 4WD with 4 doors. Like the new design for exterior, and upsized engine. Lots of power, and average MPG is around 17.5 with the auto. transmission. First thing I noticed was trailer lights not working properly. A computer glich. This turned out to be a small recall. The truck came with a trailer harness when purchased. Now the blower motor quit and the interior lights. A wiring cluster behind the dash for the odometer has my HVAC wiring running through it. Why would they run a 40 amp fan through this? I've been driving Toyotas since 1983. Considering going back to Toyota before my warranty expires. ","Ride, power, satellite radio, exterior looks.","Run HVAC, lighting, and other important wiring on seperate circuits. Stick shift in way of seeing dash controls  and over cup holder on floor, making hard to lift beverage straight up whilr driving. Maybe check Toyota to see how they maintain quality of product for reliability."
4.875,Outstanding!,REDNECKKID11 ,09/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just bought my Dakota. Love it! I Love the off-road capability, the looks, style. Even it's 3.7 L v6 performs great in towing, off-roading, etc.","4x4, cargo light, foldable arm-rest  + console, comfort, sleek design.",
4.875,Luv the new Dakota,Phil in the Burbs ,08/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just picked up my 08 Dakota. Turned in a Ram for this little beauty. Very impressed with the looks, interior, and drive-ability of this truck. This is a very capable truck in a smaller package. Very easy for the wife to maneuver in traffic. Vehicle fit and finish is excellent. Better on gas than my old Hemi. Interior is very quite and the upgraded stereo is very crisp and clear. Really like the Sirius radio option. Had an issue finding room to store all my gear from the Ram. Solved by mounting on of the collapse-able bins from interior to the truck bed with sheet metal screws.","Interior, Fit and finish, towing capability, Sirius radio, power seats, easy to drive.",None at this time.
4,Muscle truck,Jason ,06/25/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,3,5,"Originally was going to get the 07 at the end of the year. But after hearing about the new V8 I waited. I was not disappointed, power is very good. MPG could be better but is OK at about 16.5 average. I like all the storage, but dash looks and feels like cheap hard plastic. Cab has a lot of wind noise, but with stereo on it is not noticeable. Ride is stiff and bouncy, very noticeable while going around a turn with bumps, feels like the back end is going to lose traction. I have the Sport and it should have been set up to look sportier like the Colorado with a lowered stance. Front seat only holds 2 people while my older model holds 3, 3 would be better. Stock rear tinted windows are dark.","V8 is awesome, might be faster than the Hemi in the Ram due to the Ram being a 1000 LBS more. ","Better gas millage, lower stance, interior plastic needs help. I like the seats from my 03 better."
4.875,Does It All,doug ,06/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My truck is actually a Sport w/V-8, crew cab.  This is my 3rd Dakota.  So far, my favorite.  It's red, fast, looks sporty, handles great, rides good, doors open wide, seats firm and supportive, tows, looks good anywhere, best warranty of anyone.  Traded down from full-size Chevy.  Like this better.  Easier to get in and out of and wife likes the size.  Mileage is 21-24 on highway driving sensibly.  City is lower of course.  Acceleration is matched by nothing else is its' class.  Brakes and transmission work flawlessly.  When you turn on your truck, does it return the favor?  Mine does!","V-8,interior room, handling, fuel mileage (considering what it is), looks, I like it all!","Slightly longer bed, dress up dash and door panels (too plain, but ok), GM style sun visors, SRT8 option."
4.625,Nice size truck ,Gerard ,05/20/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Did some research on this truck and the ratings  I read are true. My mpg on highway at 71 mph at 65 degrees, little wind, is around 19 mpg the truck had 65 miles on it. The V8 has some good power. Got the Laramie package with the trailer tow package. Truck pulls 3000 lbs real good. Love the black metal flake paint with the chrome front end looks like a  Harley truck. Truck gets a lot of looks, Dodge did a good job on redesigning the front clip. Ride is pretty good for a pickup truck.",Looks,none
4.75,Outstanding build quality,Tom Cebula ,02/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"After having a Honda, and a Toyota, I find my new Dakota to be their equal in terms of build quality. In fact I drove a Ridgeline, and a Tacoma on the same day I drove the Dakota, and the Dakota blew them away in terms of quietness and ride quality. The 08 interior is an upgrade from the previous year. I have the V8 which I need for towing, and so far MPG is not the greatest (14 around town,18 HWY) but it should improve once it breaks in and the weather gets warmer. The new engine has a lot of guts and will serve my needs very well. So far I love my truck","I bought the Laramie with the tow package. I like the heated seats, and the remote start has been a blessing in this cold winter",None at the time. They really did ther homework on this 08 Dakota
4.875,Best Truck for the money,usafblt ,01/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I looked at all th mid/small pickups.  My father-in-law owns a Colorado.  I have driven many of my friends' pickups and none compare to the Dakota.  Better ride and definitely more fun to drive.  The new redesigned suspension is a bit stiff, giving it a tighter feel, but it is still better than the Nissan, Chevy, and the Ford.  The Toyota rides a little better, but the Dakota, even with the V-6 Auto has better passing ability.  Gas mileage is OK, I am getting about 22-23 MPG in mixed driving.  Overall, I am very pleased I chose this truck and I look forward to many years of enjoy my time behind the wheel. ",The body style.,Gas mileage.
4.875,Solid Ride!, Blue truck ,10/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"It has a firm, borderline stiff ride, much less spongy than the previous model years. We have many 2006-07's in our fleet and you can tell the difference. The console and cup holder layout is great and much improved. All controls are easy to reach and use. The ride is quiet. I would recommend the V8 if you need serious power. So far, my 3.7L accelerates good enough and maintains highway speeds adequately. We have had very few quality issues in our fleet so far with Dakotas, and hopefully this series will even be better.","The rear storage baskets are collapsible and are a neat feature. The cargo rails w/moveable tie downs are a long-overdue improvement. YES fabrics are nice feature and are easy to clean up, especially good for fleet use.",My old toolbox w/medium depth did not fit this model due to hitting the wheel wells. Will presumably only take a shallow-depth toolbox behind the cab- not sure how they could improve this.
