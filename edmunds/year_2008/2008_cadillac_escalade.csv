They are a great car!!!!! There is one problem though. It's the chrome on the car. The Magnesium Chloride destroyed it!!!!!!!! We took it to trade it in and the vehicle runs great, probably one of the best running eight year old Escalades ever and it had 77000 miles on it when we took it to trade it in for a new one. The dealer offered us only $18000!!!!!!  The vehicle had to be worth $25000 or more. I also have an issue with the radio. If you turn the radio knob to the right, the radio channel goes the opposite direction. Same if you turn it to the left. It also freezes and glitches a lot. The quality of materials could be better. The dashboard is plastic and so are the door panels. Overall, I absolutely adore  this car and highly recommend it.",,

I already replaced the u-joints in the rear but I have not got into the front. This is my first awd vehicle.

No, the child lock feature was not engaged. All problems were fixed but I only had 8000 miles on it when all this happened.
