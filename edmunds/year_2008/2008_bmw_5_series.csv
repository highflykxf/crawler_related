4,My 20th BMW since 1972!,P.Y. Maida ,11/27/2016,4,5,5,,,4,5,5,5,,,"I love BMW's. And I love wagons. I always buy them used and usually with over 80K miles due to my budget. Had a 2006 530xi and loved it except for the lack of acceleration. The 2008 with the twin turbo 535xi is my perfect wagon except........there are a few issues which must be looked at or taken onto account when buying a used 535xi wagon. The original issues with the fuel pumps and turbos either showed up and were addressed somewhere before 50K miles or they will not show up (faults that is, normal wear and tear will always be an issue). Faulty comfort access on the 2006 530xi cost me $1400. but my 535xi is perfect. Rear hatch lift motor should be tested prior to purchase. Also the rear cargo window switch which has a habit of shorting due to lack of sealing. Easy fix but these things can mount up. I had a 540it 2003 with M package which was my favorite car of all time but my 535xi has more HP and get and go , is 4 wheel drive, all the tech goodies and gets much better MPG. Perrrrrfect! My new favorite.",,

5,Pleasantly Surprising,Ultimate Driver ,11/10/2016,,4,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"Purchased the vehicle as CPO 5 years ago. The car has performed satisfactorily well over time. 528i sport offers a great balance between performance and maintenance cost. On the sport package, you can rotate tires for longer life. Having the CPO warranty and maintenance to 100K was instrumental in managing ownership costs. Also, pays off in the long run because this ensures maintenance is performed by BMW using genuine parts. I feel this has contributed to reliability I enjoy at 130K mile. The cheapest way to maintain a BMW is with the dealer. BMW service is great and the reps generally do their best to help you out. Although, service must be scheduled well in advance to get a BMW loaner.  Reliability, relative to 15 years ago, has improved on these vehicles. Overall, maintenance cost is comparable to other luxury makes.",,

Got the car as a CPO and drive it about 15k miles a year combined city and hwy driving. I have done zero maintenance other than brakes (once), tires (three t8es) and oil changes (every 10k miles). The only caveat is this car will chew through tires - you'll get about 30k out of a set no matter what you buy - and because of the AWD, you have to replace all 4 at once. It drives like a dream - especially on the back roads. After a snowstorm once the seal around the rear window got dislodged and water got in the trunk and down into the well under the spare. BMW stupidly put some electronics there and the TPM monitor control until got wet and shorted out. I dug it out of there, dried it off and let it et in a bag of rice of for a day or two. plugged it back in and it worked fine.",,

2,The Dream Wedding of Vehicles...,Blondeinabmw ,05/28/2016,1,2,5,,,1,5,5,5,,,"Every time you take this car in for service, it costs $1,000...except for when it costs far more than $1,000. Bought my gorgeous 535i (with the sport package and premium sound) as a special order, and it arrived with 3 miles on the odometer. Since I bought it, I have been plagued with problems. Admittedly, the first 4+ years were pretty much covered under free maintenance with the warranty, but since it went off the maintenance agreement, it has more than made up for the savings. My car is 8 years old and has 107K miles. During the time I've owned it, it has required: - Three complete sets of tires plus two sets of rear tires (roughly every 20-30K miles)- A valve replaced in the engine (towed)- All six fuel injectors (limped in to the shop)- Walnut blasting of the intakes- A water pump (towed)- Computer software reinstalled (twice, took more than a week each time at the dealership for the reinstall to ""stick"") (towed)- Three fuel pumps (towed)- And now, the CCC is bad. This is a fancy acronym for the iDrive computer system that includes navigation, radio, bluetooth and all the car's controls. It also needs the hydraulics in the hood replaced, the xenon headlight has a malfunction (which requires the entire headlight assembly to be removed from the body of the car to change a LIGHTBULB, and if god forbid the ballast is bad, the bumper must be removed as well). For a change, it is actually driving fairly well, but this repair is gonna cost more than all the others yet! I've not added it up, but I think this car has cost me at least $1,800 a year in maintenance costs since it went off warranty in 2012, sometimes more. I will say that the cupholders in this car are the stupidest thing ever designed. It also does not hold car seats very well - infant carriers have to go in the middle back seat or the passenger seat will have to be on the dash, and convertible front-facing seats don't leave a ton of room either. It drives beautifully. Handles like a dream. Is so comfortable. Feels like a beast when you want it to. Rides gracefully. Looks pretty. Has an amazing sound system. Gets pretty good gas mileage all things considered. SUCKS THE LIFE OUT OF ME.",,
2,SAAAAAADDDD BMW owner,Annie ,04/16/2016,1,3,3,,,1,3,3,4,,,"I bought this car used with a clean car fax in 2010 with less than 15000 miles.  I bought an extended warranty just in case.  I spent 8 month researching vehicles i would like to own and keep for 10 years.  I have made a very poor decision.  The maintenance cost on this vehicle will exceed its worth.  It's been fun to drive, a very comfortable car with decent gas mileage.  However, when I've taken it in for service, it's like sleeping with the devil.  Goodbye emergency fund and hello credit card debt.  It's the most disappointing feeling to love a car so much and be saddled with such repair bills.  Fuel injectors replaced, water pump, thermostat, numerous hoses and vacuum hoses, and now replacing turbos and catalytic converters all before 90,000 miles. Not good resale either!!!",,
4,"Fun to drive, but unreliable",lindy62 ,02/18/2016,2,3,4,,,2,3,4,4,,,"I have owned many German AWD cars, after the Audi S4, this is the most fun to drive.  That being said, it is not the most fun to own.  I have had numerous mechanical issues and even more electronic issues.  I have heard a few complain about the battery. I have switched to an Optima battery, which is cheaper and lasts longer.  I have heard that BMW knew about his battery draining issue before they release it, but decided to replace the batteries instead of fixing the issue.  The VANOS system had a glitch out east, oiling system out west, sparkplug in the Midwest, and a constant brake issue.  I am afraid to open the sunroof for fear that it will not close properly and I’ll have to take it apart and manually close it.  The parking assist doesn’t work at all and when it had worked it was over sensitive.  Our front windshield was replaced and I still can’t get the intermittent wipers to work properly.  The transmission seems to be slipping and I am not willing to spend the money to replace it.  If it was repaired at a BMW dealer, it would total the car.  Nothing is cheap to replace on the car and local shop don’t have the tools or electronics to work on it, so I have to drive 6 hours to fix something and spend big money on labor and parts.On the bright side, it gets good mileage for the performance.  It rides well, but I feel it is too soft.  The backend wiggles on slick roads when it hits a bump at speed and that can be a bit unnerving. There is a lot of room in the back with the seats folded down and have used it as a makeshift tent in bad weather (as long as the sunroof doesn’t leak).  The interior has held up well and the body hasn’t rusted.  Would not buy one again, because of the reliability issues.",,
2,"I might have gotten a lemon, but a money pit",DHecker ,02/04/2016,22,3,4,,,1,4,5,4,,,"The most telling example of the problems I've had with this car is the following.  The BMW has warning signals for many different things, including that the outside temperature is now 37°.  However, it does not have a warning signal to say that for whatever reason a seal in the transmission has blown and all of the fluid is leaking out.  Leading to the need for a new transmission.  I have had innumerable problems with the engine, electronics, lights, you name it.  There is now once again an engine warning light on.  I bought the car in 2011 with only 25,000 miles on it.  If I have not spent $15,000 in repairs since then, I would be shocked.  Don't waste your money.On the positive side, when it is working and especially on the highway it is a lot of fun to drive.  It gets mediocre mileage around  town (it is quite heavy).  But it gets somewheres around 33 miles per gallon on the highway.",,

Turn off traction control in the rain and the machine is a blast to have all sorts of fun with! However, things seem to go wrong electrically. My adaptive headlights, rear brake light bulb and reverse light bulb all went out in the same week. Also the fuel pump was leaking when I bought it but I was aware of this.

If you are looking for gas mileage stay away from the V8 but if you are mostly looking for performance and power, this is definitely the car for you.  I have owned different cars, but this car is very special.  You feel in control and you feel like you own the road when you are driving it.  It is definitely a joy.  I have owned the car for about 2 years now and I bought it with 73,000 miles.  Currently at 104,000 miles and no major problems so far.  The only major issues was resolved under warranty after a few days I bought the car at the BMW dealer it had an oil leak and a rattle in the engine but they fixed it. Also the car's transmission would malfunction sometimes but they reprogrammed the computer and the problem was gone.  Other little things that I have done myself are the angel lights that went out, fog lights, brakes, etc.  Something that does bother me is the transmission at low speed, it is a bit jerky especially when you drive it first time during the day.  I've been thinking about upgrading to the F10 version but reading about all the mechanical issues they have, I think I'm sticking with this one for now since it has been such a great car so far.",,

Built quality is great, offcourse drives awesome. Not much to complain about this car.

Better stock tires (mine are Goodyear's RS-A came with the car) these are the worst tires you can find on a sports sedan. Most BMW's come with continental's which believe me are much better.

After about five months an oil light came on and then noticed a large oil spill at the house. The oil pump had exploded so the dealer took care of it. Then the power steering belt broke and took the AC out with it. Not exaggerating in saying the car went in for at least 10 visits and half were on a flat bed. I really like the car other than the fact I don't know when I am going to be stranded by the car. The Dealer did a shoddy job of fixing the initial problem which turned out to be a leak in some gasket they found after about ten visits.

A Benz is probably the best car to ride in, but the BMW is the best car to drive. And I like to drive. I am coming out of an 07 E350 and just bought a 08 528i. What a difference. The 528 is so fun to drive, that I cannot wipe the smile off of my face. It just handles so well and there is plenty of power in the 528. You really do not need the 535. It definitely reminds me of my 2000 528 which I liked very much. Purchased car with premium & sport packages, navigation, auto, iPod and xenons. Great package. The E350 was like driving a sofa down the freeway. The 528 is like a sports car, it is on rails.","Handling, styling, new auto shifter, iDrive (and yes iDrive is complicated.

I needed a new car to replace old Lexus that I had. 528i was the first one that i test drove. Honestly, I did not know what was so great about it other than handling. It drove nice but I felt like it didn't justify the price tag. After leaving BMW, I test drove Acura and Lexus and then Thats when I noticed the difference! All the interiors looked nice and all but it just didn't feel right when driving the Japanese. BMW hugs the road in cornering and drives uphill smoothly and effortlessly.

Also test drove the GS350 AWD, and it gave good competition to the 528xi but in the end, just the sheer driving pleasure swayed me towards the 528xi.

Ably handled everything from tight country roads, windy descents to 100+ mph cruising & stop n go on the Autobahn. Averaged 26+ mpg. Coming from Acura TL, never thought I'd say ""Good value"" about a BMW, but the performance, ride, sound and handling are so amazingly solid while seating 4, it's difficult to imagine why you'd spend so much more for a little impractical Porsche (compare 0-60), or unpredictable Maserati GT.

There is a programming glitch in the transmission software which BMW has not been able to correct. The car slams down into first gear quite violently when I accelerate from low speed (such as when turning a corner onto an uphill grade) or slowing for a light and then re-accelerating without coming to a complete stop. The car has been back to the dealer twice - they have been superb, spending lots of time to try to solve the problem - but BMW corporately has no solution at this time. They say they hope to have a software upgrade sometime in September, but make no real promise that this will correct the problem. We shall see.

This is a driver's car not a typical American or Japanese built car. Don't complain about the cup holders, BMW doesn't expect you to drive the autobahn with anything but two hands on the wheel. Focus on the quality of the ride beyond the seat and gadgets, it is amazing.  If you really want the power go for the 535 or to tour the country side with a 550. I find the 528 gives me what I need in power with a little economy unexpected, I'm averaging 22.4 mpg in the greater DC area.","Simply put the drive; lux ride quality in a car that's under 50k, sport ride in a four door sedan with comfort, all wheel drive that puts you into the corner and keeps you there.

Why sacrifice comfort, convenience, or practically for pure driving pleasure (like Porsche), when you can have it all?  I drove a bunch of Audis, checked out a bunch of Mercs - but man, after having another BMW, you can't change to anything else.  Only Germans can make REAL cars.  I'm biased, and some people don't really care about the driving experience.

The 300hp turbo engine is great although the gas mileage of 12 we get in the city doesn't even come close to the window sticker promise of 17.  All other reviews are accurate with the cupholders and weirdness of iDrive.  It's not that the iDrive is hard to use, but when coupled with nav, and having to scroll and type, it can get tiresome.  But other features, such as a/c controls, and awesome bluetooth -- they just changed the laws here in CA, and it's already saved me a few tickets -- it's really leaps and bounds above the 04 325ci BMW we traded for this one.  ","The seats with sport package are the most comfortable in any car I have ever owned (2 Audis, 3 Mercedes, Saab, Volvo, VW) hands down. The beauty of the exterior, with those gorgeous LED rears lights and helpful side entry ones.  The superior fit and finish of all parts (except cupholders).

In the end I settled on the Acura RL, Infiniti M35x and BMW 535xi (though I loved the M series, I did not consider them practical for year - round driving in my climate, even with snow tires).  From a ""thrill of driving"" and performance perspective, the 535xi quite simply left the Acura and Infiniti in the dust.  Acceleration and handling were no contest  8 months later and a rough winter under my belt, and I couldn't be happier with my choice.  Comfort seats and access are a must. ","Driving in manumatic brings out the best in the 300 hp twin turbo with no noticeable turbo - lag.  As far as acceleration and handling, only a true sports performance sedan (BMW M series, Merc AMG, Audi S series) could do better.  The iDrive is a breeze.","Better cup holders, I suppose.

I love the throaty sound of the V8 and the smoothness of the engine. I test drove the 535i also and even though the 0-60 performance is close (according to the specs) the 550i feels much more powerful because of its substantial mid range torque. My car has the sports package so it is a little stiffer than my old car, a 1999 528i (non-sport), but the 550i is not too stiff at all and corners extremely well. The iDrive was not hard to learn and in fact I like it. My coworkers are fascinated by the iDrive and other electronics gadgets.

The car is luxurious, yet when you drive it, it is like a sports car. The twin turbo accelerates so fast, that it pushes you backwards into the seat.  It is so solid compard to my 330ci, and yet is accelerates faster.  Cornering is not as nimble as my 3 series, but it's a bigger car. I don't know why people complain about iDrive; it's great. Anybody with any intelligence and who can use microsoft windows can use iDrive. It takes about 15 minutes to figure out, and it basically is a computer in your car without all the clutter.  I have a 6spd manual, and I love it. It is smooth and sure.  Amazing.","Twin turbo engine acceleration, luxurious feel, solid chassis, amazing performance, iDrive prevents clutter in cockpit, huge trunk space, large back seats with leg room compared to 3 series (I am 6'2"" and have sat there), cheaper than E-class (which get worse mileage and are used as taxis in europe).","Cupholders are awful, window controls on drivers side should be in middle like 3 series, need a better door pull on driver's side to close door, shift knob should be leather-wrapped instead of cheap plastic."

I also find the seating positon too low, and the driver's seat does not go high enough (I am 5'11""). And then there is the much maligned iDrive.

This new 550i is awsome. I searched hard for a manual. Suddenly there were two and both were loaded with mile-high sticker prices. This is a dying breed. A compelling reason for choosing a 5 Series BMW over a similar sized Mercedes or Lexus is the availability of a V8 with a slick shifting 6 speed manual.

5,Too Much Fun,JMac ,04/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I drove the 2008 535 sport & 550 sport back to back hard. My advice to anyone looking at both of these cars is this. If you can't feel much of a difference between the two cars, get the 535. I felt the difference immediately that is why I went with the 550. It feels very close in over-all performance to the 2001 M5 that I used to have. My wife had a different point of view but I used the Jedi mind trick on her value focused mind. She was happy enough with the 535 sport. I would agree that the 535 sport is 95% as good as the 550 sport for about 10% less money. I just happen to be one of those people who enjoy driving in that extra 5% zone and don't mind paying a little more for it.  ",Real time traffic with the nav.

The torque and shift sequencing is incredible, especially in Sport mode (don't be cheap, get the sport package). Loaded up on all the extras, Major improvements on the nav, iDrive and iPod interface.  Thought I was possibly downgrading moving from 325hp down to 300hp, believe me... the 535 hands down out performs the 545, gets better gas mi. than the 550, and from my experience, is equally as fast.","Twin Turbo engine, Logic 7 sound, ipod interface you can shuffle, voice command, flawless bluetooth interface, comfort access, sport package",Near perfect.

It's fast, responsive, handles incredibly, stylish, comfortable, and a pure joy to drive. I bought it fully loaded with the excpetion of the Heads- up display and night vision.

I had a 1997 BMW 528i and this new 528i is so much better in almost every department compared to my old one.  I looked at the E60 when it came out in 2004, but I didn't like how they placed window switches and other little things. The 2008 refresh got it right and I love the improvements over the earlier E60s. Great car all around!","I love the hands free calling with Bluetooth. It works like a charm! I really like the iDrive.

This car is much more comfortable and ""luxurious"" while maintaining an even better balanced feel on the road (it is winter so i have not been able to push it real hard, yet).  The iDrive requires some learning investment, but the payoff is real - you can set up a lot of the car features to your personal preferences. The back seat and trunk are larger.

The 535xi was simply the best car that I drove.  It also was the most expensive of the group that I tested.  In fact, like others have said, it is the best car that I have ever driven!  The technology is not intrusive, it is helpful and with a little practice and reading the manuals, the navigation system and communication systems are your best friends.

Very happy with this vehicle, except that the wagon's sport pkg does not include sport suspension or wheels. So this car has a little too much lean in corners and the steering is too light. Performance is excellent for a 6 cyl. and the drive train is extremely smooth, almost too smooth and Lexus-like. This 6 cyl wagon costs as much as a well equipped 8 cyl X5. The vehicle is top notch in nearly every aspect but I have to question what makes it worth almost $70k. Without the sport suspension, it doesn't have the BMW performance edge that justifies the price premium.","All wheel drive, extremely smooth drive train, multi-contour seat upgrade, all the entertainment upgrades.","Needs a sport suspension and wheels. BMW should NOT assume that people buying a wagon do not want sport driving dynamics and handling. If they put a sport suspension on the X5 they should put it  on the wagon.

The heads up display is excellent, especially with directions from the navigation system on the windshield.   The night vision camera is just plain cool.  It's an easy car to drive with confidence.

4.875,Perfect Chicago Sedan,grung ,09/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I was looking for an all wheel drive sedan (5 passenger) to replace a G35 (rear wheel drive) for Chicago winters. I drove all the competitors from Audi A6 to Mercedes E350 to Infiniti M and so on. All of these were good cars. The BMW with its new twin turbo in-line 6 was the smoothest and best handling car, hands down. The luxury feel has been enhanced in the 2008. But when the need for speed is requested, this car responds with no hesitation.   This is the best car I have owned.",The L7 stereo upgrade is phenominal with the iPod hook-up. The Bluetooth marries with my Blackberry nicely and makes communications easy. AWD for those snowy Chicago winters.,More storage would be nice. The wheels are OK but there are better offered on 550.
5,BMW 535xi,JeffM ,09/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I previously owned a Lexus GS which was a rattle trap. I was originally concerned that the BMW would ride too rough for me since I have some pretty severe back problems. The 535 far exceeds my hopes and expectations. Not only are the comfort seats the most comfortable I've ever owned, but the ride is superb. It is a bit firmer than the Lexus, but the support the seats provide make the BMW a much more comfortable car for me. And this thing is rock solid - no rattles. Plus the fun factor is out of this world.This car is a rocket on rails. My wife always disliked the looks of BMW, but I can't get her out of this car. The iDrive is a piece of cake, nav system is great, and the prem stereo rocks.","Comfort seats, ride, handling, twin turbos. Mileage gets better every day avg 22 mpg. The fit and finish are outstanding. This is the best car I've ever driven.","Better cup holders, maybe some more stylish wheel options for the all season radials."
5,The best ever ,Tamer ,09/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was initially interested in the 3-series because of the unparalleled road feeling, but with the new 535 300 HP twin turbo, I got that same feeling but with the luxury of a 5-series.

It accelerates like an 8-cylinder would with same quietness and ""kick"" one would expect from a V-8.  Handling remains outstanding and the interior comfort and fit continue to impress me.  The fuel economy is not as good as my 2007 530i, but good enough to warrant a second look considering the power and smoothness.  The new interior features make this one the best yet.","Push-button pre-sets for radio stations, ability to change vent settings (directional flow of air through vents) without having to go into iDrive, comfort access impressive compared to other vehicles with keyless entry, new logic-7 with HD is stupendous.",I would suggest going back to the standard auto transmission and doing away with the electronic transmission.  I don't like the feel of the electronic transmission - you have to look down to see what gear you are in.
5,The best ever,Tamer ,08/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was interested in the 5-series but wanted to get the 3-series feeling which I think was lacking in the past 5-series.  With the new 2008 twin turbo 300 HP, I am now having the luxury and enjoyment of the 5-series with the road feeling of the 3-series.

But you never choose a car by what other people are saying. It's just what you ""feel"" when you drive.  BMW 535xi had an ""x"" factor which no others had. I'm sure other BMW owners know what I'm talking about. Some dislike the rear end, but I think it was ahead of its time and others are catching on. Some say M is at same level as BMW. Are you kidding me? Maybe 2007 model. Not the bi-turbo 2008. I don't know what the fuss is about iDrive. It was confusing during test drive. But if you know how to use a computer or playstation, you should be smart enough to get it down within a week.

I have had an E Class and this blows it away. The gadgetry is a hoot once you master the iDrive, cruise settings at 1 or 5 MPH is cool and the 3 blink turning blinker was smart also. Sirius radio is a must, and when you get your stations preset... enjoy the ride!","Sirius radio, cruise control, keyless = convience package, big trunk for golf clubs, lots of horses.","Drink cup holders, what a joke."
4.625,Great... but,Greg ,08/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"Bought the wagon after waiting till 08 model came out. All good things in it but the seats are not as comfortable as the, for example, old 525 of 2001 (I had one). Seems that seats are now smaller(?). Lines are beautiful, got it in Titanium silver and black interior. really nioce. Got the navigation system. I still have to decide whether I like it or not (it is a bit distracting). Should have a ""beep"" something to alert about animals, etc. Don't think I would order it again. The iDrive is OK, but quite frankly if it didn't have it, things would be easier. Do not like the run flat tires. MPG is disappointing (highway is a challenge to stay at 24 MPG).",Lines. The ability to take my dog in the back. Sound of engine. Acceleration (although it has a slight hesitation/turbo lag). The fact that its a BMW.,"It's overpriced. MPG needs to be improved. City driving is 17 with the wagon and I get 16.5 with my BMW 4.8 X5?! Improvement is needed. Ride is good,  had problems with the tire balance. Overall, nice but it seems the older models were better except, of course, for the wonderful new engine."

This car has been great!  Fast, smooth and fun to drive.  The improvements on the iDrive are substantial.  The technology is easier and more reliable than the 7.  The acceleration is better than 7, also.  So I am getting great performace and all-wheel-drive in one.  No more snow tire change over like I had to do on the 7 series.  My only criticism is the fuel tanik capacity.  I used to be able to go forever with the 7 series large tank.  This 18 gallon tank means I'm at the pump every few days.  If I could change one thing, it would be a larger fuel tank.","My favorite ""creature comfort"" is the iPod dock.  My favorite tech feature is the ""Traffic disruption warning"" on the nav system.","Larger fuel tank is a must.  Also, more interior storage space would be nice.

Matched to a 6 speed sport automatic with paddle shifters, this car hauls!  The design is appealingly unique and avoids the cookie cutter quad headlights and triangular taillamps of the Mercedes lineup.  The interior is an ode to minimalism but with practical secondary HVAC and stereo controls to compliment the iDrive package.  This car provides tremendous performance, the utility of a 5 seater, aggressive style, top notch build quality and solid value.  We Came, We Saw, We Bought.","The fat leather and aluminum trimmed Sport steering wheel with paddle shifters.  The 18"" multispoke wheels.  The aggressively styled tailights.

4.75,Fantastic,ajm2727 ,08/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Car is a dream.  The ride is like that of any luxury sedan, yet the car feels tight and responsive instead of much like others.  Power, even in my 528 is good, and the engine is seamless.  Seats are comfortable and every button is where is should be - even iDrive, which is not the problem it is rumored to be. I have no problems using it at all and 10 minutes of instruction from my salesman was all it took.  The car looks great.  Sit it next to a Benz E, Lexus ES, Infinity M, or Audi A6, and it beauty prize goes to the BMW.  It is the best of the bunch.  Wonderful car!!","Ventilation feature is a nice addition and welcome on hot days, chimes instead of bells are harmony, and precise airflow controls let my passenger/me choose exactly how much air flow over every inch of our bodies.

5,Wow! BMW Does It Again,Alexander ,07/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"What an outstanding value. This car provides the perfect combination of acceleration and handling you'd expect from BMW. Fuel economy is good and the manual transmission ties it all together. The comfort seats are just simply unbelieveable.  After 1600 mls of both highway and city driving, its clear that the 528xi has more than enough power to deliver the performance I need. I passed on the twin turbos and don't regret it a bit. Frankly, the 528xi is just plain fun to drive!  The hot buttons on the iDrive dramatically simplify the system. The navigation system has the best display I've seen. The HUD is awesome.","The comfort seat is the best car seat in the industry. I really enjoy the iPod adapter.  The nav and HUD combo is sweet and easy to use. The iDrive ties it all together. However, the BMW handling takes the cake. ","This is difficult. A slightly larger back seats would be nice but not at the expense of the trunk, a larger car, or more weight. Then again, I'll never ride back there. Finally, the BMW cup holders are still universally poor. "

5,Great Choice,back to BMW ,07/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The 528xi handles like a champ and is fun to drive. It has plenty of pep, especially in the sport mode.  The iDrive is pretty easy to use, the seats are great,  and the car has a muscular but refined look.  I left BMW for years when the 7 series repair bills rivaled the cost of my mortgage.  The siren song of Lexus lured me for a bit, but life is too short to compromise. ","The smaller engine has plenty of pop and the AWD gives great confidence in the turns, not just in wet weather.  The gear selector is quick and easy, the bluetooth works seamlessly, and the car is very comfortable.  It has the sturdy feel missed by the Lexus GS 300 and handles rough roads smoothly.",Bigger back seat as four adults are more than snug and a slightly longer wheelbase.  Be careful with valet parking as they will rip out the key (rather than simply press to extract the key) and have no idea how to place the car in park.

I knew I made the right choice, but I didn't realize how right it was until I drove away from the dealer. Simply amazing. That's the only way to describe it. Simply the best car I have ever been in or had the pleasure to drive. A perfect combination of tight steering and sitting in the lap of luxury. Run, do not walk and purchase this car if you can.

The powerful engine ""makes"" the car.  The new interior design, along with programmable satellite and FM radio stations is a plus.  Addition of wood along the door makes it luxurious.  The electronic transmission takes some getting used to, but no problem.  You've got to get premium sound with HD radio option and Sirius radio if you are an audiophile and love crisp, clear, outstanding separation of sound.  I don't like the standard wheels, but one can live with them instead of spending 4000 dollars on upgraded wheels and tires.  The addition of leather around the console is also a nice touch.","Twin turbo 300 hp engine; electronic transmission, additional wood along doors, presets for radio up front without going into iDrive, comfort access system is great, HD radio and premium sound stupendous, rear sunshades a must here in Florida.  Daytime running lights great.","Put some nice wheels on this 57000+ car - it's a shame they are so plain and chintzy, place cupholders somewhere else (I've complained about this time and time again)."

I had considered a Mercedes E350 4-matic and an Audi A6 Quattro. I am glad I went with the BMW, I think I received much more for the money. I have also found the ""very difficult"" iDrive system very easy to use.

The sleek look and design provides for outstanding apperance and the ultimate driving experience. It drives like a dream on the highway and on bumpy roads.  While the car is supposed to be for me, I can't keep my husband out of it!  I have only had it for 4 days, but I would highly recommend it!!",What I love the most is the 4 year maintenance plan.

5,This car sets the NEW standard,Johnny C ,05/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car handles very precisely.  Engine feels like a V-8 even though it is a V6 turbo.  It is scary-fast... if you are not a good driver you can get in trouble with this much speed.  the interior is very comfortable -- the Premium Package seats are highly adjustable and best I have ever sat in.  I previously had a 2000 528i and a 2002 X5.  BMWs build quality and design is just so much better than even a few years ago.  For the money, this is the best sports sedan period.  Better than Lexus, Infiniti and even Mercedes that costs $10,000 more. The iDrive is a little tough to use, but if you are technologically proficient, it'll only take you a day or two to figure out.","The 20 way adjustable seats are great. Also, the iDrive offers lots of features.  Bluetooth for cellphone works flawlessly - it turns radio down when a call comes in.  Stereo is very good for a stock stereo -- MUCH better than prior stock stereos from even a couple of years ago.","This is a minor issue, but the turn signal stalk on the steering wheel provides no loud 'click' to indicate the turn signal has turned off.  I find myself having to constantly check that turn signal has turned off.  Also, the dashboard look is very spartan -- it could have smoother, warmer look."

BMW has also made subtle changes to the interior that make the car feel more luxurious (more wood and leather in the right places).  I would highly recommend this car.",The new twin turbo engine is very smooth and powerfull.  The iPod integration is a great additon.
