5,What Camry should be!,Vladimir ,10/07/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,5,5,,,"The only reason why I bought the 2008 Camry was because I owned a 1993 Camry that lasted 300,000 mile without any major repair or problem.  I bought it used in 2010 with 28000 miles, it was a lease return vehicle.  100,000 miles later, it still looks and drives like new and never had any major problems with it.  The only thing I repaired in the car was the rear passenger hub bearing which cost less than $150.  I just replaced the original brakes last year simply because I wanted to.  I changed the tires twice and battery one time, usual car wear and tear.  It is nice to drive, comfortable and quiet.  The only this I probably don't like with this car is that it drives very light, too light for the size and type of car.  Toyota contacted me for all of the recalls and they fixed those.  They sent me extended warranties for the dashboard (cracks and warp dashboard) and engine (excessive oil loss), but never had to use them.  We really need a van or SUV for the growing family, but we can't imagine trading or selling this car since it has been really great to us.  Over all we really love this car, at this pace this one might reach 300,000 miles too.",,

1,WORST CAR EVER,Alan Thiede ,05/31/2016,1,1,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,THIS IS THE WORST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED. LAST TOYOTA.,,
1,Toyota Technician Fires Manufacturer,Ben ,05/05/2016,2,1,1,,,1,1,2,3,,,"There's a lot you need to know about this car before buying it. Firstly, if you DO buy it buy it new but Ideally lease it. Toyota has gotten incredibly shifty about their warranties and their reliability has dropped. I am reviewing this car based on owning it and also based on working on the brand professionally. In the year that I bought this car used, my dashboard has melted and been replaced by Toyota under warranty. My engine burns 1.5 quarts of oil per 12,000 miles due to faulty piston ring design. They will not cover it due to a lack of oil change receipts and the nature of it being purchased used. The gas pedal had a recall that was performed due to it functioning incorrectly. All Toyota Water pumps will leak antifreeze which is considered normal by the manufacturer. The sun visor in this particular model is held up by a metal clip and actually mine fell down while I was driving on the interstate one day. My radio was designed without the JBL option and you cannot upgrade after you purchase your vehicle. The wiring harnesses are not included and they will not allow it to be performed. The radio I was stuck with has major issues - as do many of them on that model. The cd players don't read properly and I went through five of them both new and used. You will be unable to do anything other than upgrade to an aftermarket radio designed specifically for this vehicle. The interior design of this build was built incredibly cheap and lacks durability in all senses. The alignment of the drivers seat is off to the right so eventually you will notice the left side of your seat wear out. The air conditioning system has a bad habit of growing mold and smelling like death due to evaporator moisture. Toyota's legendary paint has once again failed on my vehicle. The clear coat is paper thin and scratching everywhere. Also in newer vehicles, you will find stone chips and rail marks on every single car, even new ones. Trade in value has dropped horribly with this model and I'm financially underwater on this transaction. Toyota factory strut mounts are notorious for failure - especially the drivers side front on this model. The drivers side axle is also an issue and has a tendency to make noise and fail. The transmission software on these cars has been flashed several thousand times due to bad programming decisions and hesitations. Every time the car is at the shop there is a new recall open on it. My rear view mirror peeled in half and I ended up replacing it with one from a 1999 Toyota Camry. I actually have stopped working on new cars recently, due to the unreliability of the automotive industry of today.",,
3,Not Toyotas Finest Effort,Detectivejojima ,03/10/2016,4,3,4,,,4,3,3,4,,,"The car overall is a good car for everyday transportation. Quiet, comfortable and reliable. Not exciting, nor fun to drive, but it does the job. Weak points are struts, which had to be replaced around 40k. Small leaks and very soft, just too soft, and not under warranty. Needed to replace power booster on brakes around 150k. First time on any car I've owned. Those are expensive fixes. Also, now at 175k mileage, smoke comes out of exhaust when 1st starting in morning, regardless of weather. My mechanic says oil burn, but oil does not drop between oil changes, so not much oil burn, if that is what is causing smoke. But still runs great, no other major problems and I guess it's been overall a reliable Toyota, but below my other experiences with my 5 other Toyotas over the years.",,
1,Buyer beware,Hermania ,01/25/2016,1,2,2,,,1,3,1,2,,,"I bought my Camry new in 08. At 75,000 the engine blew. I took it to the dealer and they stated there is a design flaw in all Camrys in that they burn oil at a rate of 2 qts per 3000 miles. If you check your oil between changes you will discover this for yourself. It was in the dealership for 3 months and is still not running properly. Please take this advice and don't listen to the Toyota dealers. There is a serious design flaw in all Camrys. They are counting on you not checking the oil in between regular oil changes and before you realize it, blown engine. I was a big fan of the Toyota lines but now will not even consider buying one. I am not disgruntled by this experience , I just want to save others the headache of going thorough what I did. There are better choices out there. And by the way: all toyota service centers are crooked! Buyer beware.",,

Since I got it I had few repairs I did not expect. First the U joint for the Steering wheel column right at 50K miles after the warranty expired. Few thousand miles later the left front Spring broken and paid another 900 $ to replace the spring and strut. Not to mention the engine starting to burn oil already at 50K miles too. I had a windstar few years back and had a spring broken and because Ford is having a concern for their customer's Safety they did have arecall on this problem.

4.25,Outlived any American car I ever owned!,cooksfallskid ,01/11/2014,,,3,4,4,5,,5,3,5,5,I owned several brand new Chevys and NONE of them came close to the reliability of my 08 Camry. ALL of the Chevys I had ever owned were in need of major service before 30k. I regularly commute from Upstate NY and this car never gave me any trouble. I follow the owners manual and service it myself. Synth. oil from day 1. I will not let those butchers at the dealership touch this car. Aside from the normal wear and tear items it is the most reliable car I have ever owned. I never had a car that had factory brakes last 100k! The only major component replaced was the water pump. I drive this car HARD and make regular trips to .FLA and NC 2 to 3 times a year with it. Toyota got it right this time,"I drove the 4 cylinder automatic and then the 4 cylinder manual. Its like night and day! The 5 speed is a blast to drive. excellent acceleration. It will chirp the tires through third! The clutch has currently 139,000 miles on it and shows no
signs of slippage or chatter. Once this car is rolling it goes! The Chevy Impala cannot keep up with it on top end (Most Chevys has a top speed limiter 103-107mph) I have had this up easily to 125 mph and pulled away from them.","One thing I find talking to other Camry owners, tire life is very very poor on this car. I have researched and bought the best tires I could afford. They will not last more than 2 1/2 -3 years or 35,000k. Even with regular alignment checks (every 6-8 months) in needs a slight tweaking every time and all front end parts are good. "

Then, the last few weeks I was hearing this really loud scraping noise - at first I hought it was my breaks, but turns out I need a center exhaust pipe.... won't know if that gets covered under the warranty until tomorrow...that's another story, wish I had enough space to tell you about the poor customer service I experienced.

Eventually a TSB was sent out by Toyota regarding vibration/shudder after months of complaining, but it didn't completely resolve the issue.  Toyota Rep insists it's the way Camry is designed.

It could adjust several different ways and with the telescoping wheel it felt perfect. We took it around the block and it handle like it was a sports car. I could not believe how quiet it was compared to my other cars I have had in the past. The white outside with  the dark leather set it off just right.

Toyota has done nothing to address this issue, which I noticed immediately after driving off the new car lot. I did not test drive this car before signing the paperwork, but instead drove a test model ""just like it"" which did not have the glitch. The dealership and corporate office have shown an utter indifference, and deny that this is a safety concern. It IS a safety concern, so please consider a different manufacturer.",It is impossible to give any positive feedback on a car with such a glaring safety issue. Three to four seconds of delayed reaction is a very long time when rapid acceleration is needed. ,"Toyota says this acceleration defect does not occur in cars manufactured after February 2007, but our car was manufactured in October 2007.  Toyota's corporate office told us they are ""not required by law to disclose known problems with their cars"" to potential buyers.  Beware--Toyota has changed!"

I went from a V6 to I4 and there's plenty of passing power.  I also went from leather to cloth seats and it's not cold - no seat heaters needed.  If you want more class upgrade to the XLE but get ready to pay 3-4K more.  That's a personal choice.  It's only been a week but if I have to take it to the shop you'll be hearing from me.  I bought certified used (3,800 mis) and the best thing about that is that the warranty is 7/100,00 mi - better than new.","Performance for a 4-cyl, auxiliary port for my iPod, sleek and gorgeous body lines and curves.","Extras not incl.

If you drive one for more then a couple of minutes, you'll see and feel the car's Lexus like qualities. The interior and exterior design is very pleasing to the eyes and touch (except for a few cheap plastics in the cabin). The cabin is very quiet on all fronts via wind noise, engine noise, road, etc. Going over bumps is like driving over gentle pebbles. There is no rattles in the cabin just tranquility. Now if you're going to be driving your car like The Fast and Furious, it also does good in that area. ","I'm just going to name a few great ones for the sake of time. Engine noise (almost can't hear), same for the wind and road noise, dual chrome tailpipes, bluetooth, 268hp (YOWZER!!), leather and woodgrain interior, stereo system sounds fantastic (very loud)!","The cheap plastic in the cabin has to go (not a real big deal but had to mention anyway).

The performance is decent for a 4 cylinder, although it could be better. For me personally, the manual makes it blast to drive, but during sharp cornering there is quite a bit of body roll. Despite the body roll, handling still feels fairly secure. Gas mileage is good, I get about 21 mpg in the city. Perhaps my favorite part is the way it looks. The lines of the car are gorgeous, especially in the blue ribbon metallic color.

The clutch has the right amount of travel, the shifting operation is smooth, and the power of the engine is great whether you're driving in the city or on the highway. The fit and finish of the interior is excellent with a lot of shoulder and head room.  The seats are also positioned in a way that is very comfortable.  In this price range it offers quite a bit.  I'm only twenty years of age and I'm impressed with this car even though it is marketed towards a different crowd.","The eighteen and a half gallon tank which translates into a long range, the fairly large 15 cubic foot trunk, the shifting operation which fits well in this car, the positioning of the controls, and the large storage compartments that are within the reach of the driver.",I only have minor complaints and these are: the shape of the wheel well is designed in such a way that you're forced to buy mud flaps to prevent road debris from scratching your side fenders and the rear cup holders should not be in the armrest.

Oil filter is a little different on the v6. It is a cartridge element, not a spin on filter. This makes for a really clean oil change. Leather seat with Liquicell are amazingly comfortable. The ride is remarkable - very quiet and noninvasive. Transmission shifts confidently and correctly. It does NOT ""hunt"" of gears. Camry v6 is really quick. Originally wanted JBL sound until I heard the standard cd - there is no need to upgrade. ",V6 power and economy (you only lose 2 mpg over 4cyl). Quiet ride and Toyota quality interior and exterior.

It is a solid, dependable, good looking vehicle that has proven itself to be the best value in its class. I treated myself to the navigation with bluetooth capable telephone functions. Combine that with the    adjustible heated leather seats, smartkey entry and starting, and the traction control and you have a damn nice car (lexus like) right at $30,000.

As one would expect, I have had no problems with the car except for low pressure in one tire.   Getting actual mileage around 26 highway (set cruise - 50 miles round trip) and 18 city during first 1k miles.  I think this could be due to the automatic transmission slipping.",Plenty of room.  I carpool to work with 3 other big guys and everyone is comfortable even in the back seat.  Smooth and quiet ride. ,As a tall guy I can not find a good adjustment for the driver seat head rest.

This car is fast. You don't even have to try to go fast and you look down and your going 80 on the expressway, plus it has the tiptronic shift which really unleashes a beast under the hood. Cornering is excellent, I can take a 30 mph corner at 55-60 mph. I also have the vehicle stability control and traction control. The navi is very user friendly. I love this car in every way.

2.125,DO NOT BUY CAMRY I REPEAT,Honest Opinion ,12/24/2007,,,2,3,1,1,,2,4,3,1,"This is a horrible car. All the talk about Toyota quality is really nothing more than marketing-hype. The so-called quality is NOT there. Rather, this car is riddled with many problems--some of which are really serious and dangerous.  First, the transmission is really bad. It slips all the time and shifting is very poor. It could cause ""unexpected"" acceleration, and can cause serious accident. Second, the quality is bad. The gaps between parts (e.g., dash board) are wide and uneven. 1970 Dodge is probably better assembled than this. I've already visited the dealership three times because of various problems. Third, don't expect any fun in driving this car. Steering is very unresponsive. ","It is spacious--but it is probably more accurate to say it is ""bulky."" While the car is quite large, they didn't use the space efficiently.  There is almost NOTHING to like about this car.","Complete redesign of the power train. This car has 3.5L 258HP, but the power train does not allow to use the power. In particular, the transmission is a borderline criminal act. I've never driven such a poor transmission.

The 4-banger has enough power to safely merge onto a busy highway or pass a fifth-wheel on a 2-laner. Its lines are clean, but a little ambiguous in light of the Accord.

3.875,Toyota GPS is worthless,DonH ,11/08/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,3,3,4,3,"I am generally happy with my Camry, but the GPS is frustrating and almost worthless.  The necessity to press ok to a disclaimer before each use is ridiculous.  You have to pull off of the road and stop in order to the GPS, and the passenger can not reprogram the unit while the car is moving.  I would not have bought the car if I had known how frustrating the GPS is.  I will not buy another Toyota unless the GPS system is changed.",,"Make the GPS at least as useful as a $300 Garmin or Tom Tom.  Toyota, give me a choice of whether or not I want to program the GPS while moving, and stop trying to be my Mother."
5,Awesome Car,Felix ,11/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is the best car I've ever purchased. It's suspension is smooth, the 2.4 I4 has nice acceleration to match its fuel economy. The Camry's interior is very refined (in the XLE), and the upgraded 440 watt stereo system is great. Exterior styling is nice, and the overall build quality is perfect. ","Leather wrapped steering wheel with audio and climate controls, 440 watt stereo, smooth ride, interior design, manual retractable rear sunshade.",Engine noise on the 2.4L I4 is a bit noisy at first.
4.875,My 2008 Camry,Katie ,11/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I just recently purchased a 2008 Camry LE.  I love it so far.  I like the brightness of the dashboard and the exterior design.  It rides smoothly and I am still on the same tank of gas that the care came with and I purchased it 2 weeks ago.  I would highly recommend this car to anyone!,"Dashboard design, exterior design, size.",Key pad on door.  I loved it on my old car.
4.875,2008 Camry,Allen ,10/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Great commuter car for the wife. Good value for the price, with nice looks and fine (so far) fit and finish.","Simple controls, standard safety equipment, good gas mileage. ",
5,Great car!,Great car! ,10/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is a great family car and very comfortable. Rides great and the v-6 has plenty of power.,Aluminum wheels are a must and the auto start is great for warming it up.,"Needs navigation available in the LE model. Bell to ring when getting low on gas, cars used to have that. All new cars have too much interior cheap plastic."
4.875,"So nice, and so fun!",Christina ,10/27/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I owned a 2007 Toyota Corolla LE and I was very impressed with it; however, my grandparents needed a vehicle, and it was easier for me to get a car.  So I ""upgraded"" to the Camry.  It sits a little lower to the ground, but the ride is smoother and there's so much room! The power driver seat is nice, audio controls on the steering wheel are convenient.  I don't mind the plastic dash, but some don't like it.  I've read some criticism of the look of the 07 and 08 Camry, but I think the ""bulbous"" nose is actually cute.","Power driver seat, audio controls on wheel, lots of room and storage, smooth ride.","Some may not like plastic dash, sits low to ground."
5,Best Value In America,M Digman ,10/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a great car, beautifully equipped with all the creature comforts you can want. As for economy, I'm beating the revised EPA MPG estimates by +4MPG in the city (25 vs. the 21 Estimate) and by +3 MPG on the highway, (34 actual vs. the EPA 31 estimate!). Beauty, styling, luxury and great gas mileage... I love this car!","Six disc in dash CD changer, 8 way power driver's seat, power everything and reading lamps for the rear seat passengers.",Don't let it get any bigger. The exterior and interior size are just right!
4,Do Your Research!,08CamryXLE ,10/04/2007,,,5,5,3,3,,2,5,5,4,"After 1 month and 1,000 miles I would have reservations about recommending this car. It looks great, and is overall fun to drive. The navigation, sound, and bluetooth operations make the car easy to drive. The interior is roomy and looks great. When merging into traffic on the second day of owning the car, I almost totalled the vehicle as there was NO response from the engine after pressing the accelerator. This happens constantly. Check nhtsa.gov for current reports. The dealer doublespeaks the issue. I also had defects in the paint that resulted in a repainted bumper. A taillight also didn't fit and required body shop work to fix.","JBL sound system with navigation, plasma cluster, odometer lights and screens, interior look, exterior 2007 redesign, rear window shade - even if it is manual.","Transmission: acceleration hesitation, downshifting when driving up slight inclines; better way to dim interior panel lights at night"
4.625,What I Expected,Dave ,09/29/2007,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I can not complain too much at all.  When you buy a Camry, you know what you are getting... a quality built, reliable vehicle.  In 2007, Toyota redesigned the Camry to make it one of the most appealing vehicles on the road.  I have had an issue with the driver-side seatbelt not wanting to click, but I am willing to write that off as an anomaly, assuming I will not have any issues getting it fixed by Toyota.  I am only getting about 22 mpg, which falls into the lower end of the ratings.  I would like to see at least 25-28 mpg.  We'll see.  Light from dash/radio is too bright at night.  It is like someone is shining a flashlight in your face.","JBL stereo, exterior design, steering wheel controls, sporty feel.","Interior lighting is too bright, Gas mileage should be a little better."
5,Very Satisfied,john ,09/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've driven my 2008 Camry LE 1,375 very pleasant miles so far. It is very comfortable, roomy and fun to drive. Fuel economy is excellent. The 2.4L 4cyl 5A has plenty of pickup when needed on the highway. I would recommend this car to a friend.  ",Roomy interior and design of instrument panel controls.,Better quality interior trim items. Less plastic.
4.25,Another Camry,high_speed_chase ,09/24/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"This is our fourth Camry, but the first with a V6. We traded a 2007 Camry SE I4, and I am not disappointed. The 3.5 V6 is very smooth and powerful. It runs 0-60 and quarter mile times of the infamous 5.0 Mustang from the early 1990s, (in stock form of course). Gas mileage is within 1-2 MPG of the I4. 600 miles already racked up since Friday night.","Power, price (when not laden with tons of options), quality.",More power?
4.625,New Toy,b gray ,09/16/2007,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"Nice car; 4 cyl power okay. Base model pricing attractive.  Pleased with historical reliability.  Recommended by Toyota drivers.   Historically, keep cars for 10 years, so we will see how good it is in 2018. I will have a better review by then. ","Exterior design, interior room, functional instrument displays, roomy trunk.",No styrofoam anywhere - please so far.
4.875,Very happy with my 2.4L XLE,Happy Owner ,09/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've had the car for a little over 2 weeks and am very happy with its pep, ride, styling, and the many standard features on the XLE.  I came from a 2000 Chrysler Concorde LX, 2.7L 6 cyl.  I was looking at the Hyundai Azera, Lincoln MKZ and the Toyota Avalon but the Camry won out.","Dark wood trim.  The light wood in the 2007 didn't appeal to me. Smooth ride.  The sport edition, LE, and hybrid don't ride nearly as well. Bluetooth audio and temperature controls on the steering wheel.","Too much light coming from the dash and audio system at night.  The lights have to be dimmed at night, and then turned back up in the daytime. I do miss the handle that was in the trunk lid of my Concorde.  I could pull the trunk closed without touching the paint. I also have a noisy fan. "
4,Nice car - giggly ride,rjohnson ,09/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,3,4,1,"This is a very nicely designed car both inside and out. The engine is quiet and smooth. The seats are comfortable. The ride is giggly with road vibrations felt through the low profile tires. This is not like the 06 and before ride. I would recommend it for the younger generation, not those over 55.","Style, quietness, radio.",Correct the ride which is very disappointing. It rides similar to an SUV.
4.375,2008 Camry,Dennis Lauterbach ,09/12/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"So far after 100+ miles of driving, the Camry has the comfort, quietness and pep that the Camry is known for. There is no question that this car is rock solid. Toyota's quality with the unibody welding rather than the rivets by their competitors will make this another hit for Toyota. ",On my model the upgraded grille with the red paint job looks great. The low emission specs are important as well.,I think that Toyota could upgrade the interior features a bit. The large knobs do look a little cheap.
5,I bought another brand new Camry,Happy Camry Owner ,09/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have to say I love this car.  I bought one in 2007 and just gave that one to my wife, so I had to buy a brand new 2008.  It rides great and shifts smoothly, plenty of power for a 4-cylinder.  I recommend getting one with the upgraded JBL stereo.  It sounds so much better than the regular stereo.  My 2008 Camry has the upgraded JBL stereo, moonroof package, rear lip spoiler and body side molding.  I'm looking forward to driving this car for the next few years.  This car rocks and I recommend buying one!","JBL stereo, how the stereo lights up auto on/off headlights, cool looking gauges, moonroof, power seat, and so on.",None at this time.  I am very happy with both of my Camrys.
4.25,Acceleration still not fixed,Lois ,09/11/2007,,,5,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"This is my 3rd Camry since 1993.  Stuck with the Camry since I've always had good luck.  Heard the 2007 had problems with acceleration, but figured they had fixed that on the 2008.  Having same problem with 2008 as people did with 2007.  Problem is still not fixed and I want to slap myself for not test driving my new car.  Once you get on the highway, it rides beautiful, but my ride to work is all stop and go.",Exterior,More get up and go.
