3.75,Unhappy that the Dealership did not tell me about the recall on the battery,angela052105 ,02/13/2011,,,5,5,3,2,,3,5,3,4,"We bought this vehicle 2 days ago.Everything seems fine FOR NOW.Except who knows what is going to happen in the future.We purchased this SUV thinking we were going to be very happy and have no problems.Come to find out that there is a recall on the battery in this vehicle and NO ONE TOLD US, if we would have known, we would not have bought this car .I believe that we should have been told.We just have to wait 4-6 weeks before this problem gets fixed.Needless to say we will never deal with Saturns again and we will never buy anything at another Hyundai dealership again.Hopefully, some how things will get fixed and we'll get to keep this vehicle for a long time, but who knows.

Very pretty on the inside and the outside.","Not having a recall.

4.25,We Love It,Vespa2t ,08/19/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,3,4,4,3,"Have had this one for 2 years and still love it. We had a 2007 standard Vue with manual transmission and this one gets 5mpg better in the city than our old one even though it weighs 800 lbs more, and it is leaps and bounds nicer inside and out over the 1st Gen Vue. The best part of it is the exterior styling. We get asked by people all the time if its a Lexus. In black its really good looking. Only problem we have had is a bad suspension bushing, which was replaced under warranty. ","25 city MPG, great looks, good interior bits and quality, lots of cargo space, and drives nice. The Stability Control is fantastic in the snow.   ","MORE POWER, although it doesn't matter now that GM has killed one of their most progressive brands..."
3.625,Good but traded in,dmb ,06/14/2010,,,4,4,3,3,,4,4,3,4,"My driving experience was good with this vehicle, but the ownership experience was not. We bought this vehicle based on past experience we had with Saturn. Then gm got rid of Saturn, but promised to service our vehicle. Since it was a hybrid we were skeptical but were willing to see. At 27k the service lights came on and the local gm dealership said it was the battery but there were none in the us. A week and a half later we still don't have our vue back. When we get it back we will be trading it in and never buying another gm product.",I thought the interior and exterior styling was very good.  It was also a lot roomier than you would think.    ,Since they don't make it anymore there is nothing really to suggest.  If they were I would suggest more power from the engine and better fuel economy.  The were also uncomfortable on a long trip.
4.375,18 months and counting,phily ,11/26/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,5,4,4,5,We've found the Greenline to be the vehicle we expected and more. It is my wife's vehicle and she drives it like she would any other car. Certainly not optimizing mileage yet our avg mpg is 27. I keep to tire pressure around the maximum 50psi for optimum tire roll. We've also traveled 2000 vacationing recently and it performed admirable. ,Quiet smooth ride and handling. Exterior styling. Hybrid warranty.,Bit more cargo area. Fog lamps. Restyled mirrors.

2.625,It's a LEMON!  No Joke!,jimmy ,10/07/2009,,,5,5,3,3,,1,1,1,2,16K miles in and it's my 4th trip to the dealership to the address the Fuel Economy issue.  A hybrid that can't get more than 18 MPG in the city???!!!  It's a Joke! Here is why... GM Hybrid technology is faulty.  Ford got theirs from Toyota and the Escape gets 30 MPG (my neighbor has one) that's not a Joke.  Maybe it's because it's a Mild Hybrid and GM never got to the full hybrid or plug in as expected.    ,"Loved the exterior and when people turned to admire the car, then I told them the MPG and they laughed.  Less box shaped than the Escape, but the mileage shadows all the good features.","Get Hybrid technology like Fords, which Toyota has Perfected is willing to share.  More power."
4.125,Depends on the driver,Eric ,10/03/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,5,"Not being a full hybrid getting good milage out of this car really depends on the driver and how much they drive.  If your making infrequent short trips your looking at an average of 20-22MPG.  The killer is not running 100% off electricity at lower speeds.  This was a used 2008 I got for a steal (18,990 for hybrid with only 9000 miles and leather, sunroof, etc).  The previous reading had 20.7MPG for the average.  Probably why they sold it so quick.  I cleared this and was at 30.1MPG myself by the time I got home (60 miles).  That took work, my guess is 26-28MPG with my usual driving style.  Thats definately not bad for a SUV and better than my 4cyl Altima which was around 24.8.",Not VUE specific but these newer cars can do so much and look so nice.  A lot of good change in just 3 years (coming from a 2005).,HD Radio instead of XM.  They already made the 2009 a full hybrid.
4.875,Saturn Vue Hybrid ,Saturn ,06/07/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,We purchsed the Saturn Vue Hybrid in September of 2008 and love it!! Very comforable to drive---quiet interior. We are averaging 27 city and 33+ on the highway. We have 10k miles on it and no problems so far. One tip-- we got nitogen in the tires on the last oil change and it helped with fuel economy.   ,"Nice list of features---heated seats, rain sensing wipers, etc. ",Would like ro see a trailer hitch available for a bike rack.
3.375,not so thrilled,2008 VUE hybrid ,05/10/2009,,,4,4,3,4,,3,4,2,3,"i bought a 2008 vue hybrid in 9/08. The car is nice - trims and style are great but two standout issues so far. First it was the roof racks - there are none and no optin for the Vue Hybrid. Thule makes one but its $500 dollars and needs to be custom installed. Second, mileage - I've avg'd 23.3 MPG, that's the best so far driving everyday. Granted i drive a little fast and due to new locale often in a city mpg mode but even on long highway trips still avg the same mileage - just not worth it. Additonal draw backs - no AWD bad in winter/rain, transmission vibrations in cold start weather, lack of pickup by 4cyl.   All said I tried us car and  i'm going back to foreigns","xm radio/onstar, controls on steering wheel, auto thermal controls, rain sensor wipers, easy fold down seats for large cargo loads","stronger powerplant, AWD, sunroof wind deflector, truly better MPG"

4.875,Excellent investment all around,Sailor602 ,11/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I bought the hybrid Vue 6 months ago. Average 28 MPG city and 33 highway with a modest driving style.I keep tire pressure at 40 and get better mileage. I love the battery assist, engine shutoff at stop signs/lights, and load carrying capacity. Plenty of roominess in rear seats and in cargo area. I've let the XM subscription expire; there's enough good radio locally. Ride is very comfortable, handling is great. Front seats are comfy with good view/reach of all instruments. ","Love the two center arm rest storage sections, the iPod connection, rear seat back reclining adjustment, fuel economy.","HD radio, sunroof, & spare tire options.

4.625,Very good value for the money,Richard ,10/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"I am pleased so far with my VUE, have had it for about 6 weeks. Real world mileage is 26+ around town and on two short trips averaged 31+. Very good for a 3800lbs vechile. For the price compared to other hybrids, it's a great deal, wish GM would extend this BAS technology to other vechiles in their line  ","OnStar, for directions. (now my wife cant yell at me) extending arm rest is also good, wish it was longer. Fit and finsih are very good.","Passenger side front door should have its own lock release, slightly rough ride on unimproved roads. Still have noise when i make left and right turns, dealer told me this is ""suspension loading"". Saturn should address it on their next build"
2,Buyer Beware.In the shop since purchase.,Erik ,08/18/2008,,,4,4,1,1,,1,3,1,1,"I had my Vue for aout 4 weeks before it started acting up, rough idle, no start etc.  I brought it to the shop 4 weeks ago, and they have resolved nothing (not to mention have no leads on the problem) as I drive around in a lender car that is full of dog pee/hair.  Stay away from this product. It took the dealership 4 weeks to get the car to act up as  had described.  The most unreliable car on the road today.  Buyer Beware! Also important to note, that thus far, Saturn/GM has taken no additional steps to remedy the situation.  Telling me that this is why there is an initial purchase Warranty.  I will never again step foot in or near this vehicle.",Exterior looks,Engine/Battery
5,I made the right choice for the times.,Glad i bought. ,07/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"With the price of fuel never to go back down, I traded my van for better mileage. I used it for extra room for the things that I needed to carry on weekends and such. I was looking for something with room, comfort, and better mileage, and found it with the Vue-Hybrid. Just drive one and you will be sold.","Ride is good, I think it is quiet, controls are easy to operate. The seats are fine for me, I am 5'7 with a bad back all has been great. XM and Onstar a big plus. I love the color Golden Cashmere and interior color. Crash test results a big plus, I think Saturn are putting safety first with this Vue.","I would also liked a moon roof, but I can live without it. Keep up the good works,and improvements. With gas going where it is and not stopping, increase the MPG. I am getting 28 with only 200 miles driven. t will get better and so will my driving habits."
4.5,Great Vehicle,Mark ,06/14/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,5,4,"Just picked up my new 2008 Vue Hybrid, it took 6 months from date of order. I drove a Ford Explorer before and the Vue is a big improvement in terms of mileage.  (Just a touch smaller but works for me.)",The savings in terms of gas. Well equipped when purchased with optional equipment.,Vue Hybrid doesn't come with auto dimming rear view mirror.. even with all optional equipment. It should be available.
4.75,Love at first drive,Dave ,05/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"After researching minivans, SUV's and sedans for almost two years we decided to purchase a hybrid VUE.  We had a Saturn SL2 before and decided to stick with Saturn for their customer service and reliability.  Would have looked closer at a hybrid Hilander but they are very expensive. Came down to VUE and Escape hybrid and the VUE was a little cheaper. I love the outdoors and will always have a bigger four wheel drive for my hobbies that we can take the family on trips so we needed something a little bigger that we could fit a larger stroller and the dog for everyday driving but still get decent MPG. This vehicle fit all of our needs and we are expecting to get close to the same MPG as SL2",I really like the European feel to it. I think it drives really well.  The engine can be a little sluggish if you slowly press on the gas pedal but if you stomp on it the electric motor kicks in and it takes off. I can usually chirp the tires. I like we get the same fuel economy as a sedan.,I am 6' and the seats do not support my long legs. I wish we could have gotten a sun roof like the '09's but not a deal breaker. Would have liked to have seen a nav system.  Saturn needs to make more. Out of 5 dealers in area there were only four VUE's total.  We put down $ to reserve one. 
4.875,Very Satisfied,Green is Good ,05/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,Overall I'm very satisfied with the vehicle. I originally wanted to buy a full hybrid instead of this mild hybrid but it was the only US made hybrid that was available. I'm now glad I got this because for the money its a better deal. I'm all for the environment but if you need a vehicle now this is the SUV with the highest highway mileage available period. When the next generation comes out and gets 70 mpg I'll be all over it. But that will be a couple of years. ,"Gas mileage (27 mpg mixed driving) including a lot of stop/start. Haven't tested all highway yet. A lot of attention to detail on interior features. Looks good, drives good, lots of cargo space. I like the aux audio input. I love OnStar, connected to my Verizon account. turn by turn directions nice.","Seat is not completely comfortable to my 6-1, 220 lb frame. Not bad but maybe I'm expecting too much for the price. I'm getting used to it. I'd prefer Sirius to XM but they are merging. Annoying vibration in the door. Not sure about inflator instead of spare tire. Driver info button placement is bad"
5,I love it!,Sue in NJ ,04/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I researched hybrids for months, looked for a Mazda Tribute/Ford Escape hybrid, couldn't find one, and bought a Vue instead. I like firm seating & back support, so the Vue's seats are comfortable. The driver's seat 8 way adjustments & support are perfect for me (5'6"") and my husband (6'2""). The Vue is quiet, has a smooth ride, and controls are conveniently located. There's a perfect spot on the dash for my beanbag GPS mounting unit, and we easliy located my EZ-Pass transmitter so that I can't see it. Gas mileage has been good, and, in light of gas prices, this was the smartest purchase I could have made. I drove a Tribute AWD for almost 5 years, and liked it, but the Vue is much better!","XM Radio, fuel efficiency, driver's seat adjustments, one year of OnStar, hybrid system warranty, built in programmable garage door opener. Fair price for a very nicely made and appointed vehicle.","Should come with a cargo cover as standard equipment. Center console is a little small compared to what I had in the Tribute, but the glove compartment is huge."
4.875,Nice Vehicle,Kevin ,04/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Purchased for wife after typically driving more expensive vehicles (BMW's) and never setting foot in a Saturn dealership. The new Saturn styling is much more appealing then previous models.  We inquired about the avail of the hybrid the day the Charlotte dealership had 3 arrive with 2 already sold. Definitely impressed with the interior and exterior look and feel.  I guess I was expecting a lesser product.  Unlike other hybrids, the addt'l expense seemed nominal for the economy trade-off and the cool ""hybrid"" badges.  The vehicle has a nice, tight feel to it and handles nicely.  Acceleration has a lot to be desired but probably in line with what you should expect from this size engine","Exterior look, rims, XM radio, attractive interior, hybrid feature has allowed for average of 27 mpg. ""Hip factor"" due to hybrid.  We've had more people ask about it than cars twice the cost.","Availability of fog lamps and luggage rack on the hybrid version.  A more powerful engine would be nice if comparable fuel economy can be achieved.  Engine sounds a bit ""tinny"" if you need to jump on it."
5,Finally,Doris Healy ,04/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We spent several months researching and decided on the Vue. The vehilce is tight and rides very well (not too soft nor to stiff). Fit and finish are very good. Interior layout very convenient. We drive the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (under repair) and the Vue is very smooth. Shifting is smooth and quick enough for our liking. Initial gas mileage appears as advertised. Fold down seats are easy to operate.,"Mileage, price, interior/exterior design. We like the alloy wheels and trim. Hybrid system warranty. Ability to try OnStar for a year and 30min Verizon phone.",So far none for ride and convenience. We placed our order in Nov 2007 and they are just now becoming available.
3.375,The greatest uncomfortable car made,Ben ,04/05/2008,,,4,4,5,3,,4,1,5,1,I love the style and the performance. But the seats are made for persons of small body types. I am 5-11 inches and weigh 250lbs. The seats are just not comfortable. The dealer says there are no other seats available to switch to. All Saturns have the same seat with different upholstery. I am looking to trade it off.  What good is performance if you can't get comfortable enough to enjoy the ride.  ,"Excellent vision, smooth transfer from gas to battery. Great styling, excellent gas mileage, cool insterment panel and sound system. ",Better seats. Car also needs to ride smoother. Road vibration and road noise are a concern. 
5,Very happy w/ my new VUE!,Just took delivery! ,02/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just took delivery 2wks ago..great gas mileage so far and mild hybrid is much more sensible/cost efficient than full hybrids out there. VUE has terrific ride, looks and safety. Test drove RAV4, CRV, Escape and Equinox. Most were nice but VUE was best by far especially green line hybird version! Owned an Escape previously as well as a Corolla and this beats then all.","Looks, gas mileage, ride, safety ",Less weight for even better mileage!
