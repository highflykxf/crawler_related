About a month later the problems began. The windows would whistle as we picked up speed (dealership claimed it was normal), we had some problems with ac not working properly (dealership fixed), and then a few years later the cheap car starts having more and more issues. The passengers side mirror cover on the visor falls off, the body rattles, the passengers side window motor quit working, the brake disks warped and had to be replaced, you so much as sneeze on the thing and the paint will scratch or the body dents. Features are nice but van is built too cheap. Cant wait to get rid of it!! ",Built in DVD player and roominess,"Nissan needs to use better fasteners on the body that keep it from rattling so much. They also need better seals around the windows to keep the noise down. Basically stop being so cheap with your parts. I thought it was a great price for what I was getting, but now I realize what I have gotten. I learn from my mistakes and this is definately a mistake I wont be making again when I buy another car. I understand sometimes things happen, but with this vehicle they happen far too often. Goodbye Nissan....."

Absolutely the best Mini-Van option on the Market. I got a great deal, that Ford, Toyota, nor Honda could match. The fold down rear seating options come in handy for moving days or hauling delicate items. Would buy again it opportunity arises. Great amount of features for base model.

I thought it would be hard to see it go but na, I don't look back anymore because this performance and ride surpasses the old.  Our 2000 model was fully loaded but this is definitely a upgrade.  This is our 3rd car and it is hard to stay out of it.  I got a unbeatable deal which made it very affordable which Honda didn't offer.  For the options I have in the Quest SE, the only honda model that could compare is the Touring but the price was ridiculously much higher.

I have had it in the dealer one time and that was for the first oil change at 3000 miles.  The van is beautiful to look at, I love the auto hatch door. It is very convenient to have it open and close with the touch of a button! Also, the dual sliding doors both work and I don't notice any rattling.  The fold flat rear seats are quick and easy to manipulate and came in handy when I was moving some furniture.  My gas mileage is great, not as good as my Odyssey with the VCS engine though.  I am averaging 24MPG using 87 Regular gas. I have flat terrain and avoid highways. I recommend!",Auto sliding doors and back hatch! Back up sensors! Convenient iPod input and digital display on dash.  Sexy styling of the exterior and very roomy interior.,Add additional cup holders in front (my Odyssey had 4 - I miss this).

Our first Quest was great mechanically except for the sliding door rattles that Nissan fixed the next year.  We found the road noise to be quieter after replacing the Good Year tires with Bridgestone.  2007 had front end issues fixed under warranty, no door rattles, but we got hoodwinked by the Michelin PAX tires so we just traded for the 2008.  I think it will be quieter again after removing the Good Year Eagle tires.  I have had Eagles on other vehicles without the road noise but not the Quest.  We have loved all of our Nissan's.  They have rarely if ever had to visit mechanics.","Outside styling, always gets looks and comments.

The main reason for purchasing the Quest because all my family members like the style, interior designs of the van, even though I am not very confident of the long-term reliability of the Quest. However, I was willing to make the bet. It is no question that the Quest has much better exterior and interior designs, comparing with other major vans (Odyssey, Sienna, etc.). The only thing I did not like is the uncomfortable front seats. But the van is much quieter than Sienna or Odyssey.","Skyview in the back, dual DVD screen. The upgraded Bose system sounds just OK but I know that Bose does not make good sound system like some people might think (cause I am an audiophile) or if compared with other sound systems. The Boston Acoustic sound system in my Chrysler 300C sounds much better.","Touch screen navigation, instead of the joystick. Improve the front seats (driver and passengers.)

I've owned 2 prior mini-vans in the past & always ""felt"" like I was driving a mini-van. With the Quest, not only does it not look like your average mini-van, but you feel like you're driving a luxurious car, not some soccer mom vehicle (even though that's what it is). The interior is amazing, my husband & I actually argue on who's going to drive it where as before I could have cared less. I love this van & would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone in the market for a new mini-van w/ a large family.","Lots of room, cargo space for double stroller & groceries w/ room to spare, being able to move the seats in position for the kids & car seats.

The Quest was the best value that particular month and we've had 4 great Nissans before. The acceleration, steering, and braking are great.  Tons of power regardless of its size. Very comfortable to drive. The interior is great, and I think the exterior offers the best styling in the minivan category. The cabin is a bit too noisy.

The front and rear air is a real blessing and I love the fact the antenna is in the rear glass.  I wish satellite radio had been included instead of an add on.

You just can't beat the interior volume in the Quest and the beautifully finished interior.  The Mazda CX9 interior may be the best in the crossover market, but in our opinion the Quest is a close second.  The Sienna interior is a bit long in the tooth and the Odyssey is nice, but doesn't have the skylights or the factory trailering option which is key for us because of our hitch mounted bike trailer and cargo carrier.
