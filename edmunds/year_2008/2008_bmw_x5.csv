4,One mans garbage is another's pot of gold,Juan ,10/29/2016,3,3,4,,,3,4,5,4,,,"Wanted to write my own review of this machine. I got a hold of this truck at eight years old with 56500 miles on it. For being that old with two previous drivers, this truck still looks like new, and it seems to have been built with quality exterior paint and strong leather that also looks new.  After reading a few of these reviews I can see why people complain about the third row seating, it's really meant for kids under 5 feet. The rear view camera doesn't function well at night. The transmission is a beast but when going through first and second gear it doesn't seem to sync right after that it's all down hill. I enjoy the 350 hp, the panoramic sunroof, all accessible controls, quit ride, bright led lights, the onboard diagnostic feature. I hope my review doesn't change in the next year.",,

Worst car I've ever owned in terms of reliability. Not worth the ""privilege/pride"" of ""...but it's a BMW."" Seems there's 2 kinds of reviews here, crummy car & I love it but it's expensive to maintain (wait till you get more miles on it)! Bought used at 72,500k miles and in 3 months we were moving/driving from Seattle to AZ. We'd had it checked before the move & I asked the mechanic ""is summer heat in the desert a factor with reliability at all?"" He chuckled at the question. 1) paid $400 to check car & replace oil cooler seal & filter stand gasket. 2)&3) 15 miles into the moving trip the transmission slipped & did so 5-6 times on trip to AZ. Over $10k repairs for this & replacing the catalytic converter, and the mechanics said 4) it desperately needed a ""system update"" which had it in the shop an extra 3 days. 5) The USB port went out right away. The A/C is kind of annoying because you never feel the left drivers side vent on you unless it's blasting. 4 months later 6) the water pump went out at 81k miles along with 7) thermostat assembly: $1300. 8) The suspension needed work signal by one of many times warning light come on: about $1000.

Generally I lease vehicles, but this I chose to purchase with the idea of keeping it for 6-8  years figuring I could justify the $80,000 price if amortized over those years.  

The X5 has a lot of complex things about it so I wasn't foolish to think it would be a low maintenance vehicle - but didn't expect :  at 39K miles - New A/C ($3500) - New rear struts ($2000), & now - a new TRANSMISSION! $10,000. Seriously, at 40K miles this is a disgrace.  .  My pampered X5 has sadly failed me. Summary : Extended Warranty.","Size, ride quality, look & feel, handling","Some fit and finish issues. Tail gate (power) rattled badly from the first year of ownership until now, despite repeated attempts to correct.  Rubberized / textured interior parts have bubbled and peeled in a car that's been garaged most of its life.

Glad I did not trust their analysis.","My favorite feature is the handling of the vehicle.
Super handling in the turns.
Acceleration and braking are exceptional.
I really appreciate the 7 passenger seating capacity.
Note that the third row is only suitable for children 5 - 12, but it works for our family and is one of the primary reasons I purchased and kept the vehicle.

Never found myself in a situation that had anything to do with the car. Maneuvers almost like a small sports car. Slight understeer just right. High enough seating to see around/over anything but truly huge SUVs and trucks (unfortunately we have a lot of those in AZ). Quiet. Comfortable. With 2nd row seats down, I can throw my road bicycle in without taking the front wheel off or leaving tire smudge on back of front seats. With 2nd row up, can actually handle all our luggage to A/P - that's saying something.
Very high day to day utility! ","BMW should never bother with 3rd row seating! It will never compete with our Suburban for hauling people and stuff, nor should it try!
And X5's have notoriously soft rears, which you will find out if you so much as touch anything with it at any reverse speed, no matter how slow.
Some minor things persist even in the new X5's - like hard to set fan speed without actually looking down while driving (hey BMW, put the fan speed on the big knob and temp on the tiny buttons!).
Finally BMW, isn't there some design thing you can do to help keep black grit off the tailgate?
It gets filthy one day after a wash, both the '08 and '04.

I am so delighted I found the X5.  It is a monster in the 4.8.  Very classy, clean design inside especially.  3rd row seat is a waste.  Literally I have not opened it up yet.  The tech on the X5 nav etc is about 90% as good as Acura but the MDX ride does not compare.  The 4.8 is a race car and races through fuel to be sure.  Even with the 4.8, sport package - pretty much loaded it still does not have power lift gate.  That is a little lame.",The horsepower and the feel of the road.,Auto liftgate should be standard.

I have had it towed 1x and will be taking it in to the dealer again this week because I can't use my bluetooth or BMW assist.  I can hear them but they can't hear me.  Additionally, I don't think I have the power I should.  My last vehicle was a loaded 530i, I expected the same performance and do not get it. Yes, I realize it is a heavier vehicle, but supposedly adjustments have been made for power. I don't have the confidence to pass when immediate acceleration is required because of potential lag.  I want to love my car, this is a purchase not a lease.

I'm not going to lie and say the V6 is a monster, but it is more than adequate.  For the difference in price, I got a fully loaded vehicle.  The ride is superb, the seats are very comfortable (active driver seat with sport package and ventilated seats).  The sound system is awesome (Premium sound).  The iDrive is extremely simple to use and very intuitive.  The computer is kind of slow to load, but it is a DVD based system.  The Navigation system is very good.  The rear camera is awful.  During the day the resolution is fair, and at night its atrocious; what are you gonna do.

Much easier display than my 325, which didn't have iDrive.",I would like more pep but didn't want to spend the extra on the 4.8.  Oh well.

I put on most of the options & can't figure out why so many people complain about the iDrive. If you use a computer you can use the iDrive. I don't have to look & it is easy to navigate. There are a lot of options to set to your liking with the iDrive & I think that may be why people complain. Great vehicle. I'll buy a new one every 4 years or so.

The handling is smoothest of any car I have driven and really gives you confidence.   The front interior cabin was the largest of all I test drove.  The iDrive takes some getting used to but now I love it.  I got the 3rd row seat as that is the only model they had thinking it was not a big deal as it would be folded down most of the time, but it also means you have no spare tire and have run-flats.

I absolutely love my X5.  I test drove the 4.8 and 3.0 and came to the conclusion the 4.8 was well worth the loss in gas mileage.  At 5'7 getting in and out is a bit difficult, the vehicle is exactly the wrong height for me, and the running boards get in the way more than they help.  The power and performance is fantastic, this vehicle corners better than my Acura TL.  The throttle response can be a little quirky at times.  Having the CD changer in the glove box takes up room and is a clunky location.  The plastic on the fold down tail gate scratches too easily.","Love the iDrive, and the bluetooth functionality, the X5 downloads my address book to make it available through the iDrive.  Fantastically smooth and powerful V8.  Love the Nappa leather over the standard Nevada leather.  Diving position and visibility can't be beat.","I wish it better integrated with my iPod, it would be nice to search the iPod by alphabet the way I can with my phone book.

I can't believe that for almost $20,000 less, BMW offers so much more!  The biggest difference for our family is that the 3rd row is more accessible in the BMW.  We have car seats installed on both sides in the 2nd row and the 3rd row in the GL was difficult to access. In the BMW, the entire seat can be lifted (even though the car seat is installed) to access the 3rd row.

To add more bass or treble to the stereo is a multi process that does not need to be so confusing. It could just be a knob you turn rather than 5 clicks on the iDrive.

The X5 is so flat and stable in corners, even at high speeds its unbelievable.  The dash layout is nice, but the VW's MFI/gauge display shames the BMW.  The iDrive system is nice, but lack of touch screen entry is SORELY missing and the navigation interface leaves a lot to be desired when I compare it with my wife's Buick Enclave which is simpler to use, more elegantly designed, and is so much more functional.

The X5 is big enough to load up & take to the beach & comfortable at highway speeds. It is a truly a joy to drive. I unfortunately only drive 3 miles to & from work so we make it a point to drive to the coast on the weekends. It handles incredibly with go-cart like feel in a 4000lb + vehicle. I highly recommend.

If you expected a race car-like feel for X5, you will be disappointed. The V6 3.0si is clearly not a M3. Maybe the 4.8 will be better. I picked 3.0 for the slightly better gas mileage. Overall, this is an excellent SUV. Drives better than my Mercedes E320. The transmission picks up swiftly and smoothly. Great brakes. The new space gray color matches well with the style. I don't have the active steering so my wife complains about the heavy steering in parking lots. The worst thing is battery. Since they loaded so many things on the car which consume power, the battery wouldn't last long if you don't drive it for a while.","In addition to what said, blue tooth works very well. Love iDrive.

Engine noise more noticeable, but this is an SUV and not a sedan.  The big tires on the performance package have plenty of grip, huge cross section, work well in the rain (unlike the MB GL550), although there's some tire noise. We switch to snow tires in the winter and the noise disappears. Interior and equipment are great, driver sits higher than the 750 but the car is just as chuckable, with no body roll.

I am sure there will be more Bimmers in the garage.  ","The iDrive is what sets this apart from any vehicle I've driven.  There is a lot to it and I regularly go through the owners manual to see how to do things. Oh BTW, when you turn it on, it returns the favor.","1) Backup camera as a standard feature. 2) Better manual explaining the I-drive, it could even be a Power Point slide show. 3) A touch screen for the navigation system. 4) The voice recognition system misunderstands a lot of commands especially when there is any background noise."
4.875,After having two X3s we now have an X5,dfrith ,12/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"While the X5 at first seems a little pricey it's standard features make the price much easier to swallow.  Xenon headlights, normally about $800 on some BMWs are standard as is a 205 watt sound system with 12 speakers including 2 sub-woofers.  Also standard is an alarm system that cost as much as $500 on an X3.  Add the fact that all X5s come with BMW's great ZF (German made) automatic transmission rather than the GM6 (French made) transmission found in the X3 and you've pretty much talked yourself into paying a little more.  I'll admit that the mileage won't be quite as good as the X3 but the ride is wonderful with only a little roughness noted over the most bumpy of roads.",Smooth as silk automatic transmission coupled with that BMW inline 6 engine that they are known for.  Panoramic roof.,I know the diesels are coming for 2009 and I'm sure they will be as good as those available in Europe and most of the world.
