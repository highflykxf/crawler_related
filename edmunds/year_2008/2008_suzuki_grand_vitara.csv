5,I LOVED MY GRAND VITARA!!,Happy Happy Owner ,10/31/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I just lost my Grand Vitara in an auto accident where I was rear ended. I REALLY didn't want it to be totaled & was so disappointed when I got the news from the insurance company. I really wish I still had my car. The Grand Vitara was the most reliable car I've ever owned, along with a Honda Civic I owned in the 90s. And I've owned lots of different cars- Oldsmobile, Mazda, Mercedes, BMW, etc....I never had any problems with the Vitara whatsoever. It had over 87,000 miles on it when I lost it, and I had never had to take it in for anything other than oil changes, battery replacement, and a recall on the catalytic converter. SUCH a reliable car! I took it to the mountains, it did great. Took it to the beach, it did great. Drove it for 12 hour drives out of town on more than one occasion, did great. Handled well on clear roads, snow & rain, smooth ride, super quiet, really comfortable, good speakers, good gas mileage. I could drive 5 hours straight on a full tank. The ONLY complaint I really can think of, is that since I'm pretty short, the headrest curved a bit towards the back of my head, so when driving long distances, my neck would start to hurt just a bit after a few hours- but that's literally because I'm short and due to where my head was in relation to the back of the seat. In the end, my head actually hit that part of the seat in my auto accident & caused me a nice bump. If you're around 5'3"" like me with a short torso, I would still highly recommend the car but just be aware of that. The cargo area was quite spacious- I have moved plenty of boxes & a desk at once with the back seats down, no problem. Suzuki did a great job with this car. It's really a beast & can handle lots of situations well. I'm so nervous to try any other car now!",,
5,Great for people with back problems.,Deena Lincicome ,09/03/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"In 2008, this Suzuki was equipped with a lot of different features that I hadn't seen in other vehicles. I just wanted a small SUV because it's just me and my son. I'm 5'5 and have extreme back problems and can't stand cars because the pain of getting in and out of them was just too difficult. The GV seat is place exactly for my height. I can just sit and swing around to the front painlessly and effortlessly. The few things I wish it had was an outlet for my ipod, but they started making those even in other vehicles a couple of years later. I wish my steering wheel controls lit up. If I had only waited for the 2009, I see that was standard for it. It would be nice if the rear window could go down so my golden retriever could be placed in the back where's there more room, then in my back seat. My vehicle honestly doesn't use the gas everyone keeps saying it does. It's not the greatest, but it is 6 cylinders and an SUV so I don't know what people expect. In 2015 now, my GV only has 56,201 miles on it, and the kelly blue book price for trading it in sucks. My GV was hit while I was shopping and all they had to do was replace the plastic bumper and side door, which even came pre-painted, but it makes sounds like it was in a major collision, so I get value points dropped for that. It would also be nice to have removable cup holders so I could take them out and clean them. The back seat fold all the way up, but really it doesn't create more room, it would be nice if after folding them up, you could push a button to remove them. Mine didn't come with fog lights and I haven't checked to see how much it would cost me to get them put in. They now have an upgraded stereo system with navigation and all the plug-ins you could ask for and I'm tempted to purchase it, but if it won't upgrade my trade-in value, then I don't see the point....The only thing I don't like about my GV is the antenna. I can't get any radio stations and there's plenty around here.. I didn't have that problem with my honda.",,
4.25,Learned to love this vehicle,grandvitdriver ,12/22/2010,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,3,4,"Overall, an excellent vehicle.Over 85k miles...yep, 85 on an '08...without a serious concern.Stock tires were junk (Yokohama) -- 2 non-repairable flats in less than 5k miles; replaced all 4 w/less than 11k miles.Took me several months, numerous trips to dealer and countless phone calls to resolve the issue of DUST....a true SUV and you can't drive it on a gravel road without be choked with dust? Problem solved (simple!! keep control set to ""outside"").I am very pleased with the vehicle.I drive on 35 - 40 miles of scoria (gravel roads) on a daily basis...the GV has held up exceptionally well.","#1:
The drive line --- ESP, anti-lock brakes and traction control are OUTSTANDING, WONDERFUL and highly effective!!!
Steering wheel controls; climate control; ATC on radio and location of shifter (floor is much better than column).
Front seats are very comfortable.
Fuel door release.
Storage compartments.
","Better MPG; this vehicle should be getting another 2 - 5 MPG (at least).
Better job of keeping dust/dirt out of handles and
hinges (especially rear door...which I continually have problems with it functioning -- handle moves, but does not engage mechinism to open door; have to use pressure washer to force dust/dirt out, then open door and flush out the INSIDE of the door).
More powerful engine; with cruise control set, it down/up shifts virtually constantly -- very annoying and MPG suffers.
More comfortable rear seats; rear passengers experience a MUCH rougher ride than those in the front.
Need better support from dealers -- they are TERRIBLE! Placement of oil filter!"
4.875,I love my cae,Rosie Mendoza ,07/09/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,This was my very first car that I have bought. I fell in love with from  the beginning I never liked small sedans cause i just think they are too small and I need a lot of room. My car I have taken everywhere I travel at least twice a month to far places and my car was just so comfortable. I can drive 5 hrs on a full tank and I have a lot of room in my car to pack my luggage and my 3 dogs. It would have been great if they had an ipod plug but its ok. Other than that I LOVE MY CAR!,I love the body style and how comfortable it is. Also the buttons on the steering wheel,they should put a ipod plug on the stereo. 
4.625,Grand Vitara = Grand Purchase,sweetaries ,01/03/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,4,"This was my first vehicle I ever owned and I loved it. The price was excellent for a brand new SUV (I looked at a 2004 Ford Escape that was the same price as this vehicle). Every drive was smooth, the vehicle gave me no problems, the inside was very spacious (I was able to move to and from college with everything packed inside), and I loved every moment in it. ","Inside space, V6 engine, full-power air conditioning, spare tire, and CD player. ",Miles per gallon could be improved.
4.125,NICE TRUCK,jflippy ,11/10/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,5,4,1,5,We have this truck about 4 months and it is pretty nice. We have the Luxury model with all the bells and whistles. ,auto headlights. one touch power roof and windows.,I wish it had power seats and had a bit better gas mileage. Other then that it is a really nice vehicle.
4,2008 Suzuki Grand Vitara,diane ,10/09/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,3,4,"We traded my wife's Rodeo for the GV, she wanted something smaller. We spent 2 months researching every SUV on the market. This is a great little suv for the value. Nothing to brag about-just an ordianry suv with limited features.  It's perfect for the local driving...  ",Body style,"If you want the suzuki product to be sucessful...add the little things that would make it stick out to a buyer (I.E. upgraded stereo, better gas mileage...etc...)"
4.25,Great Grand Vitara,Steelers Fan ,09/16/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,3,5,"I bought my GV after having a SX4 for a year. (Loved that little car) But I was too accustomed to a Grand Cherokee for many years! So after convincing hubby I wasn't totally crazy for trading cars, even he has to admit the GV is wonderful. I mainly do city driving, so yes, the gas mileage isn't the greatest, but not the worst either. I have taken it on a few runs to nearby states, and actually got top gas mileage. And I can fit us comfortably in it and we can look good in the new SUV! I too, would like lit features on the steering wheel, and a rear window that opens would have been a big plus! All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase.(we got a great deal by buying year end!).","Looks great, rides nice, lots of great features!","Lit steering wheel, a rear window that opens, sturdier plastic trim (scratches easily) better gas mileage of course."
4,Love 95% of this car!,kltschida ,08/21/2009,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,1,4,"Being a suzuki owner for the past 6yrs, I didn't hesitate to buy another. I wish I would have looked a little harder though. I got a good deal, but I understand now that my monthly savings on my loan is going straight into the gas tank. Features are missing too... but I didn't miss them until I started reading the other reviews. I didn't mind that the steering wheel buttons didn't light up until I read about it and now it drives me NUTS! I love the size, I can haul a lot inside and tow my camper with no problem. I would recommend to a friend but warn them that gas will kill ya! Nice to read about the K&N Airfilter on the other review, I'll try that! Oh, whats with not having an ipod jack????","4WD, Comfortable seating, roomy, cool design and so far it's been very reliable... talk to me again when we're in the middle of a MN winter!","I-pod plug, better seat controls, lighted stearling wheel buttons, BETTER MILEAGE!!!!"

Handles great on dry roads as well as in the rain. very roomy, great for my family of four. the back door opening like a regular door is great for getting groceries out with the garage door shut, i could not ever do that with the hatchback door on that van! great family car and i love the way it looks!","style, sunroof, steering wheel buttons for the radio, 6 disc changer, seat warmers, keyless entry and drive....reallly love not having to hunt for my keys in my purse!  i love everything about this vehicle so far!","gas mileage should be better! backlit steering wheel, and doors should lock when you put it in drive.  "
4.75,Awesome for the field,arcy ,03/16/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought the SGV for its ""bring-it-on"" performance and it delivers.  Nothing can match the looks and the 4-mode drive-- having AWD and low range-is awesome.  The SGV is at home in the city or for light off-roading.   Its handling, build, safety, fit and finish are at a par with its closest competitors.  ","Size, appearance, drivability, and of course, The incomparable 4-mode drive.","Can not see the center console lighting with sunglasses on.  Suzuki is light on luxury features.  How bout adding, for a few bucks more, Aux connection, backlighting the steering wheel controls and an auto-dimming mirror and compass (no compass in an off-road worthy SUV)?"
4.5,Costa Rica Grande Vitari,Carl Hallberg ,12/19/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"Hugs the road better than any other car especially in the rainy mountains. Love the constant 4 wheel drive. Gas mileage could be better. Love the keyless entry,",Constant 4 wheel drive,"Better drink holders, bigger brakes"
4.5,The Lil Truck That Could,Jon Yankasky ,11/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,3,3,5,"The ride is astounding and the features this car has in unreal. Climate control, all time 4wd, anti lock brakes, tire pressure monitoring system and many others. There is plenty of leg room and head room and the ride is so nice and smooth. I did have the front seats altered. As someone said they were uncomfortable and it is an easy fix. In both seats are three steel rods that can be easily removed and when this is done, the seats are just perfect and comfortable. I also had an upholstery man make a 3 inch pad and add it to the center console and this car is a great comfortable ride. Buy the car/truck. You will not be unhappy.

4.625,Our replacement vehicle,Previous CRV owner  ,11/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"I wasn't looking at Suzuki at first  to replace our 2004 Honda CRV which was totaled after a accident but after owning and driving the Vitara I am quite impressed with its performance and styling, inside and out. The fwd/rear mounted engine is easy to work on, having low range control is great.","Climate control, controllable 4wd, the added fog lamps, v6 engine with 5 speed auto transmission","Aux plug in for ipods, lighted steering wheel controls, available bug guard as a option.

4.875,"The ""Zuki"" rocks for the price",zukirocks ,11/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Needed a tow-car for the new RV. Not a huge listing of vehicles that can be towed all 4-wheels on the ground. Looked at the Honda CR-V, Saturn VUE and the Grand Vitara. Loved the idea that we could get a 4WD tow vehicle. Inspected all and by far the Suzuki gave us the most goodies for the dollars. I love the smartkey, the streamlined lay-out of the dash, different lighting in console, auto climate control (south Texas gets hot!) Fun to drive, very responsive. Not sure on the reliability yet.  Haven't had it long enough to gauge mileage. Know it's not as good as the CR-V, but it has so many more features, we can certainly live with it. Looks to be a great little vehicle! ",Smart key rocks! Dashboard layout easy. Rides nice and high off the ground. Great responsiveness. Seat heaters! Never knew I'd like them until it hit freezing last night! They're great-good for my arthritic lower back too!,"More cubbyholes for ""stuff"", lighted controls on steering wheel, more pep (little sluggish for a V-6, our 4-cyl Camry was zippier). 12-V receptacles in back seat."
4.625,Great Vehicle,sodgod ,11/04/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,4,"I had originally went to dealership to look at SX-4 crossover. Liked it, but wife thought we needed something a little bigger. I agreed, so we decided on the GV. Great driving vehicle to commute to work, great around town and on interstate, easy to park, and holds plenty of stuff. Put in a K&N air filter and averaging around 24 mpg mixed driving. Looked at CRV, RAV 4 and Escape. Went with the Suzuki and thus far no regrets.","The exterior design, steering wheel controls, Smart Key. ",Make standard an MP3 aux. jack on the stereo. 
4.875,Great Mid Size SUV,PoPPa RocK ,09/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I purchased the GV for my wife due to the ever rising gas prices and let me be the first to say ""We are impressed!"" . I never thought I would ever own a Suzuki, but this mid sized SUV has it all. Now if you are looking for V8 power, buy a V8 but the 2.7L V6 has enough power to get ya' down the road. The GV is loaded with extras that most others charge for! We are getting 17/19mpg in the city and we have not taken a road trip yet. I'll report on that later. Can't complain about the handeling or size I am 6' and I have no trouble getting in or outof the GV. Heck, Just go test drive one and see for yourself. The car sold itself!

4.75,Love My Car,Alycia ,09/20/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,5,5,I never imagined loving my car this much! I absolutely LOVE my car. I would never have purchased a Grand Vitara if my sister didn't work for Suzuki. I was able to get a great deal on the car! I highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a small SUV. It drives great & is extremely comfortable. The features are endless. I am 25 and live in O.C. & anyone who drives my car says the same thing. All my friends want one & the VP of my company said he was definitely going to look into Suzuki SUV's when they purchase their next car. I had never even driven a Suzuki until the day I got mine. I got it becasue of the deal & never imagined loving it this much. ,KEYLESS entry!!! It has changed my life.  It's better than TIVO.  Being a women & not having to search my purse for my key has made my life SO much easier.  So many times I have almost gone crazy looking for my keyes.

The seats are physically hard to get comfortable in. They're designed/built for an anthropometric model of a 5'5"" person. Leg room in cockpit seat is cumbersome and your legs go numb on trips lasting 3-4 hours. Controls for the stereo and cruise control on the steering wheel are also awkward to use when not looking directly at them. They're not lighted for nighttime operation... Extremely annoying. The stereo's tinny and rattles when the bass is on 0 & volume on 15. The cloth seats are minimal~go with leather! Good luck.",I like the appearance of the vehicle from the street and the fact that you don't see yourself coming and going around town.  Bright headlamps and fog lights; it's like landing a 757! Good nighttime road visibility.,Light up the steering wheel and door controls for improved safety and night time operation.  Increase the depth the cup holders. Produce interior molded parts using a diff. compound that doesn't attract/retain static electricity. Use Michelin Tires. Install 2-2nd row 12V outlets. Thank You.
