1,Do Not Buy With Active Fuel Management,Jon ,08/07/2015,1,1,,,,1,4,1,4,,,"The Active Fuel Management System causes major problems on this vehicle.  $2,000 in fixes so far and it isn't fixed.  World Class trained Chevy Technicians are having problems figuring out how to deal with the AFM and how to fix the problem.  Next step $4,500 to go in a look and maybe fix the problem.  Maybe.  Suburbans were supposed to have a great engine.  The Active Fuel Management ruined it.  Don't let them lie to you.  There is also a  special memo inside of Chevy mechanics only talking about a high oil consumption problem that needs 11 parts added to the vehicle  to fix the problem at your own cost.  Chevy won't tell anyone outside of their network that they had to have Chevy engineers come up with a band aid.  They also won't cover any of the cost.  Do not buy a 2008 Suburban from anyone.",,
2.375,Sinking More Money Into my 2008 Suburban,08suburbanne ,02/19/2015,,,4,2,1,1,,1,4,3,3,So very disappointed with my 2008 Suburban. The car stalled in motion and I lost control. Had it towed to the dealership and told my CPS (Crank Shaft Sensor) failed but my VIN is not covered under the recall (GM06083) which is for the same issue.  $500 out of my pocket. Dealership - no help! Called GM - no help. Called NHTSA - filed safety complaint. Thankfully not many cars were out on the road but I could have been hit and having my young son in the car was nerve racking. 15 months ago engine went - again another known problem but no recall on my VIN. Very disappointed Chevy owner here!  Been a Chevy owner for 20 years. Stand behind what you build!,,If I am paying for a $65k car - I expect superior performance. This car is unreliable and becoming a money pit. Improve the engine design and stand behind what you build. Improve the inner chrome handles - cut my hand more times than I can count. Recalls should be extended to all years especially if a known issue comes up - empower your dealerships to pay for the cost of repairs where they have occurred in other year models.  American made is not something to be proud of in this model car.

Waited for second year of new model and we're completely satisfied with our LTZ, professional reviews spot on. The only option we didn't get was retractable steps. The engineering is solid, materials first rate and quality no longer an issue. As for the mpg, I work in a trauma center (ER) and suffice to say those in larger, late model vehilces with all the latest safety features predictably do much better.

I gave my wife the Tahoe and traded her Ford Windstar in for the Suburban, which I now drive. Excellent ride, nice power, good braking. I bought the LTZ, so it has all of the creature comforts.  Very comfortable. You could drive this car for days without tiring. Personally, I think it is the nicest looking truck on the street, with my Tahoe a close runner up. For city or combo driving I average 16 mpg. I tend to go 75 - 80 mph on the highway, which gives me slightly less than 16 mpg. The Windstar would give me 20 plus on the highway, so that is a disappointment.","The LTZ comes loaded, and I love all of the features. The navigation system and XM radio are great. The 4 cyl deactivation is seamless. The heated washer fluid is nice on subzero days. Driver's info center gives good info. Auto load leveling gives secure handling whether full or not.","Have the sunroof automatically close, like the aftermarket roofs.  Slide forward 2nd and 3rd row seats would help.

Also like the fact we can put e85 in it, though I will confess, in Denver traffic, we only get about 11 miles to the gallon. But at $2.19 a gallon, it only costs $65 to fill instead of $95 w/91 octane. The e85 gets us about 300mpg vs 450mpg with 91. No 6spd tranny for 1500.
