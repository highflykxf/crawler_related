5,Love the car-highly recommend,ozziecookie ,11/21/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We purchased this 3 year old 2008 Highlander Hybrid3 months ago and we could not be happier with it.It drives very well with excellent pick up.With time we have gotten familiar w/ the car and what it ""likes"".For example, on the highway, there are certain speeds-62 and 66, that it uses the electric power.Also, we are all driving less heavily on the pedal.It probably is good training to drive any car more efficiently.Overall, we get average 25 mpg.I am the main driver of the car.I use it to drive my son to school and back each day and after school lessons for both kids. My husband drives it occasionally and he loves it too.Whenever I am not using it, he uses it.","The Highlander is very comfortable.
All the seats feel supportive and cushiony.
As the main driver of the car, my back and neck pain from driving former car (2000 Odyssey-van) have completely disappeared.
My kids (13 and 15) love the speakers-which are high quality.
There is enough room if we raise the third seat for big teens to feel comfortable.
The trunk space (with the third seat down) is roomy.
Not as roomy as the mini van we had for 10 years though.
But, I like this car better in every other way.
I love that it is a very safe car and that it is a hybrid-better on gas consumption and pollution.

4.875,A reliable and fuel efficient SUV,Scott  ,09/30/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this hybrid after months of research. I actually sold my 05 highlander as I wanted the fuel efficiency. The interior is great as well as the outside design. A family of 7 fits comfortably with limited luggage or 5 with ample cargo room too. I love driving my Toyota as it cruises on batteries only. I have snuck up on many people this way. My only gripes are two: the rear 3rd row seats are hard to get into and the Battery only button is nearly worthless. You can drive on battery only if you don't floor the accelerator. Overall a great SUV to pick up used. No problems at all. I average 25 MPG in the city and about 23-25 on the freeway.  I do hate one thing, the navigation system. ","Fuel efficient, lots of features in side like heated seats, and a very comfortable ride. ","Lose the button to run on battery only, the navigation system needs a Macintosh designer to make it more friendly. It was created by someone who is obviously a tech geek and not interested in user friendly controls. "
3.75,'08 Highlander Hybrid Ltd. w/ Nav,Bill of CA ,03/11/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,2,"Coming out of a '00 Lexus RX300, I tend to compare the Highlander w/ that SUV. The driving position is not as comfortable as I can't rest my elbows on either armrests when I'm driving. The rest of the SUV is good for hauling my family of 5 around town. DVD system w/ wireless headsets is great b/c I can listen to my music while the kids watch their Cartoons. The Nav works OK, but sometimes it sends me in circles. The 2nd row configuration is what sold me on this SUV; it gets you close to what a minivan can do. It misses the minivan in cargo space aft the 3rd row-it's just enough for a folded Combi single stroller, but not much more. It makes up by getting better MPG than the minivan-at a cost.",2nd row configuration. 3rd row big enough for sub-teens. JBL sound is worth the extra $. Hybrid yields about 25.6 mpg with 10% city/90% hwy; avg. 65-75 mph on hwy. Rear camera on Nav screen is great.,No park assist in front bumper. Rear zone AC should be std.

4.75,Careful of the Paint Job,nasoj1 ,06/21/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,I am mostly happy with the Hybrid. However the paint is beginning to blister in small areas the size of a pencil eraser.  I have found that this type of paint problem has been found before with Toyota vehicles.  I have had the SUV for about five months now and the dealer told me to contact Toyota USA to resolve the problem.,"Mileage, comfort, ride and room.",Need better paint job.
5,My Dream Car from the moment I test drove,brandoshido ,03/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was in love with this vehicle from the moment I test drove it OVER A YEAR ago. So it took me a year to buy this vehicle. I am so glad i did (although my payments are wayyyy more than what I was wanting). It drives like a dream, has plenty of space for my mid-large size dog, and my workmates who I carpool with once a week. I am consistently getting 30.5 - 32 MPG off of my first 4 tanks so far. My buddies have all said the back seat is ""cavernous"" compared to my 2008 rav4 (I traded it in for this car). They also said the seats were ""very comfortable"". Get this car if you plan on keeping for 10+ years, the fuel savings won't catch up until then because of the price premium. I LOVE it!!!","Interior design is excellent, seats are comfy (leather), drive is smooth as can be, my MPG is better than the EPA estimates, feels like a luxury car, perfect city driver with the added room for my dog and carpool buddies","Take off that tacky woodgrain, add an all black interior option, replace woodgrain with black carbon fiber. I wish the battery only mode lasted longer."

FM radio without antenna.
4,Perfect vehicle for us,Nicmo ,12/25/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Owned 1 month. So far this car is perfect for our needs. Has plenty of power, big nav/back up screen, good stereo sound, quiet ride. Waited 3 yrs for the 2010 RX 350 and finally saw it  at the SF Auto show. It looked essentially the same as the old version, which we didn't care for, only slightly bigger. While at the show checked out all the Xs (MDX, RDX, FX, EX) but for the money there was no comparison, at least from a tech side and sitting in the showroom, plus this runs on regular gas. The next weekend we test drove them all except the 2010 RX which is available in Feb and found the all wheel version of this car to be as good as any of the others. ","Large Nav/ backup screen. Comfortable seating position, and third row seat.",memory seats for the driver's seat
4.25,08 HH,rtower ,12/23/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,5,4,4,4,"Highway mileage is great, 28 mpg at 70+ mph. We live at the top of a hill, + 650' over the valley where we shop and work; so my town driving isn't great, around 21 mpg, but 10+ mpg over the Yukon I had before at the same run. My major issue at the moment is the big tires on the Ltd edition, Toyo 245- 55-19, are a problem as I can't find chains to fit. With freezing rain over snow, chains are required on all roadways. The Toyo tires are just OK on the ice & snow, but I can't get any of the excellent Michelin X-type tires to fit the wheels. Comfort is pretty good, but I miss the roomyness and soft leather of my old Yukon Denali, woos, I'll make due. Overall, quite satisfied with the HH.","The hybrid system works well and the highway and flatland mileage is good. The third seat is clever and has come in handy while staying out of the way, much better than the Denali. Not an off-road rig, but then neither was the Yukon. Good turning radius and reasonable handling under geeser demands.","Still thinking about this one. The owners manual says to put chains on the front wheels, now to find chains that will work, I'm worried about some close tolerance between the tire and the strut if I can find chains to fit. Still evaluating overall. Plenty of power."
5,"Great SUV, Terrible XM",ToyotaMan ,11/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had this car for 6 months now. I'm averaging 27 mpg in mixed driving. I really love the way this car drives and looks. The 2nd row seats are very roomy and great design. The 3rd row that I thought I would never use, has saved the day on several occasions. I love every single thing about this car except for one. The XM radio receiver I had installed at my dealership came with a little surprise. Toyota engineers didn't think to make the radio display scroll information. It only displays 13 characters. So while I'm enjoying the wide range of music, I get to play a guessing game if the name of the band or song are more than 13 letters. Huge disappointment! ","Ride, quietness, MPG, great looking SUV. Really good power with econo button off.",Better XM display of songs. Make fog lights an available option on the base Hybrid (even the dealer won't install them).
5,Nearly Perfect,JShue ,09/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"There's nothing bad to say.  I'm getting great gas mileage for an SUV, 24-32 mpg.  You have to pay attention to your driving style to get it though, no fast accelerating, etc.  It handles really well for you non-sports car drivers.  It's easy to drive, fun and very comfortable.  Tons of room, head and legs, unless you are 6-2 and try to fit in the third row, although that still was better than any small car backseat I've been stuffed in.  The standard features with the base model are good enough although mine came with the popular plus package which came with more features than I would have asked for.  This vehicle was simply better than anything else I researched and/or test drove.      ","Comfortable, roomy, flexibility with 2nd-3rd rows, styling, power, fuel economy and reliability.","Ala-carte options, I have some that I don't really need and probably would have added a better stereo or something.  No important improvements though."
5,Shocked,pondscum ,09/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Being an engineer I way underestimated this vehicle. The better half primarily drives it but I look forward to the rare opportunity to ""steal"" it. Our location uses ethanol in the fuels. We are now at around 10,000 miles and getting around 29 MPG (note using Mobil1 synthetic oil). I think it was a little lower when it was new. The hybrid system is seamless and a pleasure to drive. The seats and controls are well positioned thus comfortable to operate. Handles great and is comforting to know every time you hit the brakes a great deal of energy goes back into the batteries.","Towing package is standard. There is a small funnel mounted to the block under the oil filter, no mess oil change. Rear tires are electrically driven only, less mechanical drag on the system. During towing the CVT and hybrid system are incredibly smooth and peppy.  ",The only thing I miss is a compass.
5,Love it,highlandreview ,09/21/08 19:26 PM (PDT),5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5," I just bought this car 1 week a go with only 7 miles on the odometer. I put 900 miles on it in one week (went on a road trip). I have averaged 26 mpg both in city and highway. I drove over a nail and a warning light showed me that I was losing psi in one of the tires. Without this feature I could have been stuck late at night on the road with 2 young kids. I stopped at the nearest gas station, filled up with air, and made it to my destination safely.

The car started out with a mileage of 11.5 miles per gallon on the dash board computer.  After approx 120 miles it is up to 22.5.  So far I am disappointed because I am expecting to get the sticker mileage of 27 MPG.  I was shocked and disappointed by the lack of luggage room when the fold away seats were unfolded.  Folded there is plenty of room for stuff.  I missed having my headlights turn on automatically when needed.  I love the key less operation but because of the quietness I have gotten out of the car with the car still ""running."" roof needs protective strips to protect carrying baggage.",Hybrid although a large capacity hybrid battery would allow for more electric travel.

5,More Than Expected,Freemarket2010 ,09/03/08 15:54 PM (PDT),5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5," Picked this up last month. Got it at invoice since the car market is slow and 2009 models are coming. VERY impressed with the car. Drove every hybrid out there and thought the RX400h would be the one but there is really no comparison between the two. The RX is an older, noisier, less luxurious ride than the Highlander and, interestingly, very few people realize that. That may change in 2010 with the new RXh. This Highlander really excels in many areas. Mileage around town has been 26.5 mpg-better than we read here. It is very quiet and the intelligence of the interior layout is impressive. This is my wife's car and she's coming from a Lexus LS430 Ultra and she is more than satisfied.",Smart Key is very impressive. Locking and unlocking are easy and quick as is the start up of the car. The key hasn't left my or my wife's pocket yet. The visual displays are informative and easy to understand. Sound quality on the JBL is better than expected. The quietness of the cabin is very good.,"Any more luxury features would compete too directly with Lexus. If you put your foot into it with ECON off, this machine goes... a little more horses, however, wouldn't hurt my feelings. Cars generally disappoint me but this is an impressive vehicle thus far."

Yes, they are nice and fast, but nothing blow me away like Highlander Hybrid, it amazed me by its unconventional and futuristic technology with Synergy drive, VDIM, and CVT. European/American SUVs in the market attract the buyer by putting a bigger engine, bigger disk brakes to achieve better speed and cornering, but none of them put as much work as Toyota on engineering such clean and environmentally friendly vehicle. I am getting 29 MPG with my Highlander Hybrid in mix city/highway.","Highlander Hybrid's interior is about 1/3 less noise than BMW X5 and Porsche Cayenne.  The second generation Synergy drive is really a technological marvel, it's so refined.  VDIM definitely beats BMW's DSC; I've seen several videos on the web, it outperforms BMW X5 when racing on wet/ice surface.","The mechanical part of this vehicle is extremely competent.  The exterior design is muscular, but not as attractive or sporty as some of the Europeans.  But it has great futuristic looks which I really love.  The interior gives very airy feeling for both passengers and drivers which is a big plus."

We are planning on a larger family than we have right now and needed the space.  Also, since the gas prices had been going sky-high, we felt we needed the hybrid.  We also did some simple math computation and realized that getting the hybrid for about $4K more that the non-hybrid, we could save about $3K in gas per year.  (It pays for itself in 2 years!)

Steering is light which is good in parking lots but overly sensitive on the highway. Hybrid system works well but requires much attention to use effectively and optimally.

It can take abuse by bumpy roads and kids without a hiccup.  I love the keyless remote - so handy when my keys are at the bottom of my purse.  The huge backup camera screen, extra wide mirror, and super adjustable seat mean that I can be comfortable and have great visibility.

Beginning with Toyota's amazing commitment to quality and reliability. Continue with Toyota's attention to comfort and ergonomics. Top it all off with 270 hp and 460 ft lbs of torque (almost as much as my turbo diesel!!) and it's hard to believe that it holds 7 people and gets 27 mpg!!  We traded our Sequoia in for the Highlander and haven't looked back (we loved our Sequoia!). I think I love it more than my Camry hybrid and my diesel truck! Especially as fuel moves well over 4.00/gallon.","Ride, creature comforts, power and, of course, mpg!!","As others have said, the 3rd row seat must be split 50/50 or 60/40.

And that is why I had to give a lower ""fun"" score.  Simply getting in the car and driving away as you would any other car will not yield optimal fuel economy.  Read about ""hypermiling"" for more info.  The power steering and shocks could be a little stiffer to give a sportier, controlled driving experience.  The car leans more into turns than my 4Runner.  The interior is definitely designed for luxury and comfort.  The Synergy system and variable transmission work seamlessly to provide power when needed.","The EV Only button, larger navigation/system info screen and 19"" wheels made the top of my favorites list.","Lower the price.  $10,000+ for Hybrid system is a bit steep.

We looked at the GMC Acadia, Mazda CX-9, and the Toyota Highlander.  None of the above really compared to the highlander in terms of style, options, and reliability.  Initially we were not considering a hybrid, but one came to the lot in our area.  With gas now approach $3.50 a gallon, I am beginning to think we made a good decision.  With our 3rd tank of gas, we are averaging about 26.2 mpg.  This should improve as we break in the engine.  The navigation takes a bit of practice to master, but after taking one evening to sit down and learn it, it is quite simple.","Love the gas mileage we are getting with a high powered V6 (and still has get up and go).  The navigation/Bluetooth, auto-lift gate, hybrid monitor, rear back up camera are all great features.  I also enjoy the ease of lowering the middle row seats from the rear of the car",Programmable seating and split third-row seating.  It is a bit annoying to have to move the seat every time I drive from where my wife sits.
4.75,Steady Eddie,eessydo ,04/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"Many complaints about this vehicle saying it is ""sluggish"" on a test drive.  My guess is that the dealer had the ""ECON"" button engaged when they pushed the accelerator down.  The 270 horse is more than enough to get out of a jam. Comfort is definitely not an issue.  It came down to the Ford Escape Hy or this vehicle, and while the ford gets better gas mileage and is a little more ""off-road"" ready, this car is built much better, and the average commuter will feel less bumps in the road.   FYI, you have to be VERY active in your driving style to get the 27 mpg city in this car. It will take a while for you to learn the techniques to maximize fuel economy.","Semi fuel efficient for a mid-size SUV, third row seat, quality, ride, EV mode.","""Smarter"" fuel economy built in for passive drivers.  You have to stay active  pushing EV at stop lights and around corners when viable.  Also have to use less psycho hypermiling techniques to get over the 27 mpg city.  I am currently at 28.5 mpg. "
4.875,Quality Ride,Rene'e ,04/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Before buying our Highlander, we researched and drove both the Ford Escape and Lexus RX 400h and found that for the money, the Toyota was a far better buy. The console is easy to read and operate i.e., big print. Plenty of head and leg room with added storage within arms reach, 4 drink holders, etc. too many extras to mention. After keeping mileage records for 3 months, we average 26.7 mpg. My husband, a truck guy, was hesitant about buying a hybrid, however he now hides the keys from me. The pick-up and go is comparable to any other 6cyl, however this vehicle is not for towing anything over 3500pds which we do with ease. All around a nice buy.",Storage and comfort combined with favorable mpg.,Good to go.
5,Great Car!!!,Clbinnc ,04/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was looking between the Highlander, Lexus 400h, and Saturn Vue Hybrid.  The Saturn and Lexus were both much smaller than the Highlander and the gas mileage was the same of less than what the Highlander was rated, so I went with the Highlander, plus it was the most comfortable.  Navigation system took some time to get used to, but I like it now, the bluetooth capability should come with every car made, it's amazing. The only thing the highlander was missing was an iPod jack, but it does come with an auxiliary jack, which you can connect to the iPod, just not as convenient.  Currently getting about 25.5 in the city and 26.7 highway, which is reverse according to the sticker. Overall love it!","Bluetooth, fold down seats, voice recognition and JBL sound system.","Navigation system could be easier, can't always find a business address, so it makes it difficult.

A solid all-around in-town car that can also go out on the open road.  Good leg room and head room for four 6'+ adults/kids and still have room for your stuff or more little ones.  We like the exterior look, but have to admit the hybrid drive is the wow factor.  Friends will all want a ride and will ask a ton of questions about it.  MPG is within the ranges listed.",Performance that almost perfectly balances responsible MPG and vehicle size.,"Interior trim features are ok but could be nicer in quality for the overall cost of the vehicle.  Another 1-2"" of head room would make the space perfect for taller adults (6'4""+) but it is adequate the way it is.

Giving up my Montero was tough - it had great style and fit my large family well, but the Earth's needs came first so I bought the HiHy. We are more cramped than we used to be but we are very comfortable. The ride is much more like a luxury car. I find that I drive with a more relaxed style now since I can see on the display how I'm using the engine (EV, EV-assist or gas). The roofrack is adjustable so our topper for our camping gear and my kayak will fit nicely. My absolute only complaint, and it's minor: it's got no style. But I'll take 'not much to look at' for the super low emissions and the comfort. I'm very pleased with it.","The display is really nice. I can tell exactly what's going on with the tire pressure, the engine(s), the back-up camera is there, the trip odometer, system functions, it's very cool :) ","Style!

It wasn't cheap and we expect to keep it past 100,000 miles. We were not impressed that the new Limited didn't include roof rack crossbars ($200) or door side moldings($180). The rear-seat-floor battery vents must not be blocked and that removes some room when we pack the car for long trips.","Hybrid technology, comfort for long drives - especially seating, seating flexibility, respectable performance for 65+ year olds and hopefully Toyota trade-in value. The CVT gives the impression of better performance than the tests indicate. Very smooth.","No rattle in dash. Less chunky styling, make roof rack cross bars and side molding standard, We could have done without the rear vision tv and the trendy big wheels. We would rather have a vehicle that might work for some mild off-road use. The no-key feature also seems superfluous. Add wheel locks."

Ride is great, driving dynamics are good for a bigger SUV, and the mileage for a vehicle this size is outstanding.  We test drove the Escape Hybrid and it falls way short of the Highlander in comfort, and overall driving feel.  This car is the perfect compliment to our Prius.  Not only do you we get over 26 MPG, the car can seat 7 and tow 3500 pounds.  I don't know of any other vehicle that can do that.  We typically trade in our cars every few years, but this one is going to stay for quite a while, or at least until Toyota comes out with a plug in model.

I have noticed that if you want to milk every bit of mpg from this vehicle, you need to drive in ECON mode. Using ECON mode I get 25 mpg in mixed driving. Without ECON mode I get around 20 mpg - sometimes less.  EV mode is, IMHO, a marketing gimmick as it will not work unless the temperature is right, the batteries are fully charged, etc, etc, etc.  When idling in park or in traffic, you sometimes feel a bump and small surge forward. When driving, you do not feel gas/electric switching at all.  In ECON mode, acceleration is damped to conserve fuel. In normal mode this vehicle is quite powerful and easily gets to freeway speeds.",Voice command system allows control over all aspects of the electronics.  JBL sounds system provides great sound to all types of music.  Automatic headlight system ensures lights are on/off at appropriate times.  Nav display screen is HUGE and bright.  Many system display options all useful.,Reduce road noise  Voice command system is annoying because there is no way to turn off the prompting of what to do next.  The Nav maps are nowhere as detailed as Garmin/Magellan maps - functionality does not compare.  Bluetooth system only holds 2 numbers and you can voice dial only the first.

We had test driven several HH and other hybrids and all were quiet, but none impressed us like the HH. When our HH came in we were excited.  It was beautiful and had everything we wanted, except for the NOISE! When we brake to slow down it sounds like a jet engine winding down.  It also has a click.  We were expecting the quiet we had experienced with the other HHs we drove, but were greatly disappointed.  The dealership has told us that some hybrids have that noise more than others - it is normal.  I won't order again.  I buy what I test drive on the lot.","Love the comfort of the vehicle and the solid feel of the car.

Wow.  It was clearly a better overall vehicle than any of the other SUVs I had been testing.  The interior is a family room on wheels.
