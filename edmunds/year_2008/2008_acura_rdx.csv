5,Love my RDX,Mark ,03/26/2016,,,5,,,,,4,4,,,"The handling, acceleration and look of this car is unmatched.. Love the interior and leather seats as well. The only negative is the turbo requires hi octane and the gas mileage is a little disappointing. However, with a turbo you can't have your cake and eat it too.. Overall, I believe it's the best small SUV on the market..including the BMW..",,
4,Great if you can live with the compromises,Drew Engstrom ,08/07/2015,3,3,3,,,5,4,5,3,,,"The RDX is sports sedan masquerading as a luxury SUV. Cornering and acceleration? Great. Cushioned, quiet ride? Nope. I chose the RDX because there are many SUV and truck drivers where I live and I wanted to sit a little bit higher than I would in a sedan - and I am completely sold on Honda/Acura reliability and quality. Quality and reliability have been excellent and the driving position is comfortable with excellent visibility; my advice to prospective buyers would be to simply understand the trade-offs:1) The turbocharged 4 cylinder is very responsive and fun to drive - but, don't expect to get much more than 16 MPG when you're zipping around town, or about 23 MPG when cruising on the highway.2) The taut suspension makes for great handling - but, don't expect a plush, Toyota-ish ride quality; you will feel and hear road imperfections.3) The car is very nimble and comfortable for an SUV - but remember, this is a smaller SUV and it really isn't any roomier than a smaller sedan (think Acura TSX)Conclusion; if you like the Acura feel (tight suspension, cornering on rails) and you want something with some power, this is as good a combination of value and quality as you can get in a small SUV.",,
4,Overall We Love This Car,mike ,07/18/2015,4,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"In the year 2015, had to replace our 2005 CRV which we loved, because of a hit and run that left our car trashed. We were looking at simply getting another CRV, but stumbled across a 2010 RDX at a dealer. We took it for a drive and fell in love. We didn't quite like the look of the 2010 model (fog lights are a little ""pronounced"" for our taste, so out of curiosity we looked and found a 2008 model with 59k miles that was a new arrival at a local dealer. Took it out for a drive, and loved it even more than the 2010 model we had driven earlier.  To be sure, we subsequently tried a few other CRVs (2005, 2010, 2012) but by that time I think we were just too smitten with the RDX and never looked back. We got the RDX for $15k and are sooooo happy about it. (cheaper than any CRVs we saw, including a 2005 model that would have essentially replaced the one we lost, but was more expensive than this 2008 RDX.  A couple things that any buyer should be aware of especially in 2015: (1) Mileage. We just took a road trip and got 23 mpg, which is about what it was advertised at (actually slightly better).  You have to be on top of RPMs, use of AC, buying gas at Costco, and other things if you want to keep your costs and gas use down - and those are all things we are good with doing. (2) We had a little rattling in the car when we got it. After a long search we found it wasn't mechanical, but rather the latch for back seat (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OS7CgzsiRs&feature=youtu.be), which is now totally silent thanks to electrical tape!  That's pretty much it so far, and granted it's only been a month since we bought the car, but it is a 2008 model and no other red flags (just had it inspected too).So many good things for us. The cabin is like a dream after the CRV. Again we loved our CRV but didn't realize how much better it could be with a car like an RDX. Driving it feels like we got bumped from coach to first class. Don't know what rear passenger  seats feel like, but front are awesome with leather, memory seats, amazing stereo, storage, Dual climate setting. Dash is real easy to look at and find what you need. We don't have the Tech model but don't seem to be complaining either. And as much as cabin rocks, the engine is amazing. 240hp turbo, whoa. So fun to drive!! That might have been the kicker for us, I'm pretty sure it sealed the deal for my wife, I'll never forget her face when she turned her first corner - she was like ""oh yeah, I love this car."" Separate from that, good fold-down seats in back to make the entire rear a flat surface, and our model is black with tinted windows, so lord it is sexy!If you can keep on top of gas use and budgeting, I think this car is great. I realize it's early for us but coupled with our inspection by our trusted mechanic and plans to get regular maintenance checks, we hope to have many years of RDX fun to come...",,

Reading the previous reviews for the RDX, I wonder whether some simply chose the wrong car. Don't buy a race horse, and then complain that it eats too much or can't pull a loaded wagon. This turbocharged engine has its quirks, but drive it right and you'll be rewarded with decent mileage and good acceleration. About 21-22 if driven moderately. Is it noisy?  A slight growl when floored. How about road noise? Depends on the road.

Everything else about this vehicle is simply the worst. The turbo-4 is VERY NOISY when accelerating, and a good amount of ROAD NOISE enters the cabin. Very tiring on long highway drives!!

The driver's door has an intermittent issue with some sort of flapping sound and an even more infrequent window glass rattle. The dashboard in front of the steering has an infrequent noise coming in.

I now have 3,300 miles and in mixed driving I am averaging 23 mpg.",Navigation & stereo.  Heated seats.  Quick turbo! XM radio.  DVD audio sounds incredible.,"Reduced glare on nav system screen. DVD audio discs, as great as they sound, are hard to find.  SACD might have been a better choice for Acura.

The fuel economy could be better but is improving as the miles drive increases.

4.75,Better than BMW X3,Cindy ,05/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Before purchasing the RDX, I drove a 2005 BMW X3 for three years.  I loved my X3, but the newer models are quite expensive.  I'm just delighted with the RDX.  It has a similar drive to the X3 and the savings over the X3 is huge.  Was treated very well by the dealer and I've had for a week and absolutely adore this vehicle. It is designed very well and the interior of the car is actually nicer than the X3, in my opinion.  The seating is every bit as good as the X3.   I'm looking forward to my first long road trip in my new RDX.  It corners like a BMW and has a sports car type feeling when you drive it.  It is a nice package!","Seating, interior, Bluetooth, attractive exterior, drive, cornering, great acceleration.","Better gas mileage would be a plus, but I am finding it is about the same as my old X3 - not too bad for this size SUV.

There is a slight clinking sound from somewhere under the dash that randomly comes and goes and the dealer cannot identify it. Aside from this which does not affect performance, the ride is both quick and sporty. Pick up is incredible with the turbo engine. I find that the cargo space is adequate for our needs and we can fit our child's stroller in the back easily. I can also get golf clubs in back without having to angle them. It is a fast sporty sedan in a mini SUV body. We proceeded to get rid of our Jeep Hemi Engine and lease an MDX as well putting us into our third Acura.","Turbo charged engine, sight lines, stereo system, heated seats warm up quickly.","Fuel economy is not as good as my TL was, but for the vehicle, I did not expect much more than I am getting, for the type of driving I do.

I'm sometimes surprised how quickly I can take off if I'm not careful. I'm still learning how to work the voice controls and navigation screen. I really did my homework and went back and forth about whether I should lease or own. I've been leasing another make/model SUV for the past 7 years and finally decided the RDX would be worth owning. I comparison shopped the BMW X3 and Mercedes 350. The extras in the Acura for a lot less money were definitely a great incentive. Yet, I feel like the car is just as good if not better.

That is almost exactly the same mileage my big Expedition was obtaining on regular gas.  Needless to say, I am terribly disappointed.  On a positive note, the car is very comfortable (except, a lot of fun to drive, the technology package is amazing, the sound system is even more amazing.

I put over 800 miles on during the first week and I couldn't be happier.  The turbo is awesome and the technology package is great.  Mileage is slightly better than the 17/22 on the sticker.  I was looking to downsize a bit and just couldn't bring myself to purchase a sedan.  What a great choice.  This baby drives like a sports car and still gives me some options on the utility side of things.,"Now that I have had a chance to read the book and learned how to communicate with the car, I just love the voice recognition and bluetooth.  The navi system is very good but I still like my Garmin better (my wife has it now).

I've been averaging 18 MPG around town however I do not sit in traffic very much. I had a Civic and it was a great mode of transportation.

Also, the voice command / nav system is very impressive as well.","The gas mileage is not very good; my first two tanks I averaged about 19 mpg (which is probably good). Also, it needs premium level fuel, which will add to costs over the lifetime. Seating for my kids in the backseat is just OK, not as much room as in the Lexus 350."
4.875,The perfect SUV for us,Alex ,11/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Handling and acceleration are far better than the other SUVs we test drove - Lexus RX 350, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander.  Feature for feature, none of the other SUVs we considered could beat the RDX's value.  Good thing too, because none of them were nearly as fun.  This is an SUV that will provide us plenty of utility, allow us to grow in it, yet small enough for the city, and will continue to be fun so that we won't mind keeping it for a while.","Navigation, performance and handling, stereo.","Power seats on passenger side, power rear door, better fuel economy."
4.875,The 2008 RDX beats all the competition,Dan ,11/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love my RDX. I've had this vehicle for almost a month now and I'm very impressed with everything about this SUV. I spent a lot of time researching and comparing different vehicles but once I started test driving them, the Acura RDX with the Tech package really beats all the competition. It's the best luxury for my money. Stereo sound is amazing. Interior and exterior finishing fantastic. Its fun to drive because of the smooth and powerful handling. I'm really happy with my purchase.","Sound quality, performance, interior and exterior finishing. Smooth handling. Bluetooth and navigation system is awesome. ",Improve on the fuel economy. Power seat on the passenger side will be great too. 
4.5,2008 RDX Base,benlee78 ,10/17/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"Since my wife had a baby, I have traded my 06 Acura TL (base) for the 08 RDX base model. Even though I miss my TL, I thought this was a good trade.  Pros: This is a fun and powerful vehicle. The turbo gives it an extra kick in acceleration. AWD gives the vehicle more stability. Interior and the exterior design is pretty decent. Stereo sounds is great. Price value is pretty good for a luxury/sport vehicle. ",,Improve the gas consumption. Make the door entrance bigger so that I would be easier to put in the new born baby seat. Need LED brake lights. Add power seats to the passenger side. 
5,Great Car!,Great Car! ,10/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After purchasing this car almost two months ago, I decided I had to write a review considering I have found the reviews out on Edmunds to be very helpful.  I purchased the RDX after my 2002 VW Jetta broke down which happened frequently.  The Acura is a wonderful car in general, and the RDX is great!  I couldn't be happier with my decision.  It is easy to drive, easy to park, has great acceleration when needed.  It is super comfortable and just big enough that I feel like trucks can see me better on the highway.  I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for solid reliability and easy maintenance.","Comfortable interior, sleek exterior design, excellent acceleration rates, good gas mileage, great radio, and AWD will come in handy in the winter.",None.
4.875,Love this car!,neumogirl ,09/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Have had this car for about two weeks and love it.  Test drove all the CUVs from upscale/luxury to affordable/no frills; from ML350 and X3 to the Ford Edge and Mazda CX7, even drove a Hyundai Santa Fe.  None compared to the RDX for the money and the features.  It's so much fun to drive and is extremely comfortable.  Came from Infiniti M45 so I know comfort and this RDX is just as cushy.  Look forward to showing it off to my friends.  It was a long process to decide but I'm sure glad I took my time and chose the RDX.  It was the best choice for my money!  I ordered chrome wheels and now it's looking so pretty!","The body style, navigation system, satellite radio, comfortable seats, roomy interior.  The turning radius is incredible!  I'm pretty smitten with this car!","Rear cargo door is a little too heavy and hard to maneuver.  Auto close from key would be nice.  Don't love the switch blade style key, preferred the style of my M45 key.   And it would be so nice to drive a premium car that doesn't require premium gas!  Still evaluating the gas mileage.  "
4.625,Technology Package,dan ,09/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"If you get bored easily, opt for the technology package.  Not only will this car talk to you but it will let you know exactly whats going on performance-wise down to each wheel.  The rumors of turbo lag are true from stand-still acceleration.  However, when the turbo kicks in, it's like no feeling a V6 can offer.  You feel like you are being lifted off your seat then pushed back into it.  My wife has a Murano.  This car is much smoother, ride, acceleration, braking and even the seats are softer.  If you want the performance that may outrun a BMW 3 series but need room for the family pet, this is the vehicle!","Performance, interior lighting, voice commands, Super-Handling All Wheel Drive.","Almost 40K and no power seat for the passenger or light when you open the tailgate.  Common folks, this is an Acura."
4.5,Great Car,rob ,09/19/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"Wife loves the car.  Easy to park, drive, and back camera is great. ",Tech package:  GPS is a life saver.,No passenger power seat or memory seats on a 36k car!! Gas mileage for 4cyl is terrible
4.75,2008 RDX,lwfineny ,09/13/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've had the 2008 RDX for just a few days - very impressed so far. Handling and acceleration are great. I'm 6'5"" and have over 3 inches of space between my head and the roof - pretty amazing for a car with a moonroof. Initial fit and finish seem perfect. All in all, it's a lot of fun to drive.",Great room in driver's seat. Best stereo I've ever heard in a car. Voice navigation is very cool; not sure yet whether it is a novelty or will be useful longterm. Bluetooth works well with Treo 650. ,Better gas mileage. Smaller ignition key (or push-button start).
