5,I'll have a Kia please,DGB ,11/17/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,3,,,The only problem I have had is with the computer system and 6 months after purchasing my car they reset the computer because the car was shutting down (not completely) when taking off after a stop. I recently had the same thing happen (5 years later) took the car in and they said that there were no indicators or upgrades to the computer system...I explained the first time and so they reset it again and Yay I have my car back :) It runs great and I love my Kia.,,
4,Terrific car,LPCBuckeye ,09/03/2016,5,4,5,,,5,3,4,4,,,"I bought this car new.  It now has 125000 miles.  I am very pleased with how well this car has done.  I consistently average 29 mpg in mixed driving.  While first gear is a little tricky, the car shifts very smoothly.  I won't be winning any drag races but if I am passing someone on a 2 lane and drop to 3rd. I get around them well.  The car handles very well except on wet roads.  I have tried different tires but the results are minimally different.  I have to be careful and not try to stop quickly or turn quickly on wet roads or the car will fish tail.  On dry roads it handles very well and the ride is smooth.  Visibility is very good.  The stock radio is fine for me.  The road noise is not too bad.  What I love the most about this car is how reliable it has been.  I have had no major problems at all.  Have replaced the battery 2 times and the tires 1 time.  I started going through oil at @105,000 miles.  I had to top it off about every 1600 miles.  I just had the car looked at and the plugs and belt replaced.  My mileage was 123,500.  The man was able to fix the oil leak problem with a very minor tightening of something but I don't remember what.  The problem has been solved.  I am very pleased with how well this car has held up since I drive it for work so am in it a good bit.  I also bought an 07 Kia Rondo with the exact same engine and it is doing well also.  I intend to drive this car until the wheels come off.  I am very glad I bought it.",,

The only maintenance items I have had done were rear brakes at 75,000 miles, front brakes at 90,000 miles and new tires.  Oh, forgot about the new battery at 46,000 miles (thought that was too soon).  I have had the oil changed at 3800 miles on average and changed transmission fluid once.

2,Do Not Get a Kia,barbararoberts ,09/04/2012,,,5,5,1,1,,1,1,1,1,"I bought my car brand new in June '08.The main reason I bought an Optima is because all the safety airbags on it.it really did seem to be a safe car on the market at that time.Since then I have seen a main complaint that the airbags DO NOT deploy when there is an impact.That gave me a really big concern.Well, now my car is cutting off with me as I start down the road and I have been told it is because I have used aftermarket oil filters.BULL!!!!!They put Kia oil filter on and guess what?It is still cutting off with me.I came to a T-intersection one day and it desided to cut off.When it did NO BRAKES, No Power Steering and I had to pull out IN FRONT of another vehicle that was coming and just luckily there was noone coming in other lane so that vehicle could go around me.And I guess that I forgot to mention that my 10 yr old SON was in the car with me.I have taken my car down to the Kia shop in Myrtle Beach, SC every Tuesday for the last 2 months and it also stayed there for 1 full week during that time.NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE EXCEPT A KIA OIL FILTER PUT ON...I""m considering this car to be a LEMON and I have told Kia that it will be on them if this car kills me and my son until it is fixed or replaced.I have been dealing with Wes and Bob at the Kia Service area in Myrtle beach, SC which has been very nice to me but something has to give.I am fixing to list this car under the Lemon Law with my lawyer.The safety of this car SUCKS!!I need help with this.Someone else higher up the ladder needs to step in on this case.Wes has a case number already out with the Technical staff but something has got to be done.I can not have mine and my son's life in jeoperdy like this.

Downsides: I don't get the mileage I thought it would get - seems like I fill up a little too often. At about 30, I can feel the gear shift.

The engine was clean and sounded good. I like the dual auto/manual shifting. I had 2 Toyota Corollas and this is much better. Better comfort than my Crown Victoria. A/C system is stronger than the Crown Vic. The increased MPG from my Chevy S10 will take me one month without fill ups or 512 miles. That's great for a long trip. The 2.4 liter is surprising nice and can handle almost anything. I think this car is a winner for the price. I thank God i live in America where we can chose our best values.

The pillars on the front windshield can be difficult to see around and I have removed the headrests because of visibility issues as well. The shift gate is an absolute nuisance when trying to go from ""D"" to ""R"". The key fob frequently opens my trunk because of additional keys in my pocket, but that's pretty nit-picky. Stock tires bad -  I put ""winters"" on this year to manage that. All in all, a sound vehicle at a terrific price warranties are questionable only because of the difference between dealerships.  Seat adjustment are just ok. ",Stereo system. Bright headlights.Good trunk space.Decent legroom.Good storage compartments.Good interior lighting. Dash illumination is very nice!,Hard plastic dash components scuff too easily. Visibility is poor due to headrest design and large A-pillars.

4.125,Power to Surprise,Streeter ,09/19/2008,,,5,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I agree with Kia's slogan.  I was planning to replace my well worn out 91 Honda Accord with another Accord or Camry.  I then saw the commercial for the Optima stating a price $3000 less than a Camry or Accord plus a $3000 rebate.  This grabbed my attention so I went to see what Kia was all about.  And I was surprised.  Kia has done a nice job of building a sound car with features only found on higher end cars.  I already have 3500 miles on it in two months.  My mileage has steadily increased with each fill from 27 mpg to 29.5 for my driving.  The car is quiet and shifts smooth (although a bit too frequently).  We'll see what I think after 100,000 miles but so far I am impressed.     ","Auto temp control, audio controls on the steering wheel, low road and engine noise.  Not sure if I will like the tire pressure monitoring system. We'll see if there are any problems when I put on a new set of tires.",Trunk is sort of hard to lift.  My kids find the headrests uncomfortable.  Seems to downshift excessively when going up hills.

It can carry four people very comfortably.  However, economy is a hard pill to swallow.  I am averaging 21 mpg and this is taking some getting used to.  My corolla averaged 28 mpg.

I gave the car a 9/10 on Interior only because I feel the plushness of the cloth seat fabric does not fully live up to the quality level of this car. I am impressed with how this car measures up to my test drives in similar Lexus, Toyota, Volvo, and Mazda vehicles. Sweet! The cabin is solid and quite. Rear seat leg room and comfort beyond expectation. Ride, Steering, and Handling ... ahhhh ... so good. Love the Deep Sea Blue paint. Trunk - Deep & Wide.

I am 61/250 lbs and I am satisfied with this mid size vehicle and all my friends say the same. The trunk is quite large and the only thing I dont like about the interior is the backseat head rests:  they block the view when youre attempting to switch lanes pretty bad.  The gas mileage is a little disappointing.  Its a mid size thus its a bit light and drives light and especially in the elements.,Looks very nice,Love the car/hated dealership. Dont do the ext. bumper to bumper warranty.  It doesnt even cover anything because everything is considered normal wear and tear.  It does cover the air conditioning but I seriously think thats it. They tried to put it on w/o me knowing.

The $3000 rebate and some research made the Optima an easy choice.  Simply put I really love this car.  Performance is excellent, the 5-speed manual is smooth as silk, the engine feels more powerful than the numbers would suggest.  Handling is good and the interior is comfortable and quiet (a big change from my old Rio.  It was a great little car, but let's face it, it was a go-cart with doors!).  You could easily spend a lot more for a car with fewer features.  The KIA brand may not have ""status"" but they do deliver a lot of value for the money.  ",The power of the 2.4L 4-cylinder engine.  The smoothness of the 5-speed manual transmission.  The base-model sound system is actually quite good.

I told her for the price we paid that I could get better shocks that would provide for a smoother ride, but so far we haven't made any modifications.
