4,Practical Luxury,Baker ,11/24/2015,5,3,4,,,5,5,5,4,,,"This is a beautiful car, solidly built, smooth ride, amazing sound system, super quiet. A great car for transporting people. The second row of seats have lots of leg room. People love riding in this car. A great commute car because it is a very smooth and stable ride, great handling. It is a long car, and its hard to tell where the front end is, making a little awkward to park. The best thing about this car is the price. You can pick up a used one for a fraction of the original sales price. Be warned that after a heavy rain or snow, your ""check engine"" light may come on"". Don't take it to the Mercedes dealer. Take it to your trusted mechanic. I did and he turned the light off, and it never came back on again. Don't fix anything unless you are sure it is broken. Seats seven passengers. All the rear seats fold flat for lots of cargo room. Nice sunroof.  Love this car. I replaced my Chrysler Minivan with it. My wife loves the car. Mercedes was way ahead of its time with this design. A lot of other cars have now imitated the design, but when it came out, no one could figure it out. So it didn't sell very well. All to our benefit now. Go get one.  UPDATE 12/01/16: I've had this car 2 years now, and have only had to change the oil. Love this car. Still cheap to buy used. Assembled in Alabama, USA.",,

4.875,R320 CDI REVIEW,DANIEL ,07/07/2010,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Having owned 2 previous M-B Suvs (ML and GL), I can say without a doubt that this is the reliable, most comfortable and best performing of the three. The ""R"" is more roomy than either the ML and, yes, even the GL. It also handles better and is more pleasant on the highway. How the minivan label became attached to this model is confusing. It is not styled or functions like one. The diesel is the only engine to have as it accelerates strongly and is very frugal for a vehicle of this size. The styling was not my favorite at first, but has grown on me. It is hard to find an ""R"" owner that does not love their car. Resale market pricing for the diesel version is strong. Good job Mercedes!","Performance, interior room and comfort, fuel mileage with the diesel Good reliability up to this point, great resale for the diesel version.","Power 3rd row seat backs, improved nav."
4,Great car but often broken,Lin ,07/04/2010,,,5,5,4,1,,4,5,4,4,"We ordered this car new and love it. However we feel compelled to get rid of it before the warranty is over. To summarize the ills:  the car has spent more than 6 weeks in the shop over 3 years.  Fist the battery was changed 3 times due to faulty computer module. This model had to be changed 3 times.  The engine oil pan leaked at 30,000 miles and they had to pull the trans to fix that. A wheel bearing failed. Brake rotors had to be change and now the engine is in ""limp"" mode and we don't know why.  Routine maintenance is very expensive ($1,200 at 40,000 miles).","Size, comfort, diesel",Fix the reliability!  I worry about buying any Mercedes given this experience.
4.625,Diesel R-class well worth it.,Andrew ,05/22/2010,,,5,4,4,5,,5,5,4,5,Six large adults - not a minivan or an SUV? It's the R-class. I've never had a more comfortable car.,Excellent fuel economy and sound system.,Rear radio/CD controls would be good & ability to open rear windows by rear passengers.
5,A truly outstanding vehicle,George H. Miller ,03/28/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The MB R class with a CDI engine is the perfect all around vehicle forany household.  It is very large and very comfortable with outstanding fuel economy for it's size because the diesel engine.  Power and torque are amazing.  My wife insists on driving this luxury car for her daily 45 mile commute.  She pays for the fuel which averages 25 MPG overall and tops out at 27 with mostly highway travel.,"Size, finish and power!",Don't discontinue this outstanding vehicle.
4.75,It's Not a Minivan,Savage ,05/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Due to the growing size of our family a car that seated 6 or more was in order.  We did not want a minivan, already had an SUV, wanted a wagon or something that drove more like a car for our long road trips to the beach.  This Crossover gives everyone their own room and plenty of it with a nice smooth ride.  Bought used and it was well worth the price (new was out of our league), plus it has the Warranty so Mercedes service fixes almost everything.  ","The kids love the Panoramic Sunroof. I enjoy the roominess as I'm 6 foot 3. My wife loves the automatic liftgate, opens up with a button and the kids just climb in the back. 7-Seat option is a must. I-Pod connector is cool.",MPG is OK Windshield wiper switch is in a can't see location.  I have it memorized now.
3.625,A good family car,JW ,04/28/2009,,,4,3,4,4,,4,4,3,3,"We traded in our Porsche Cayenne for an R350 due to passenger limitation in the Porsche.  The Mercedes offered a spacious interior with comfort and luxury as well as easy maneuverability.  The engine can be sluggish to start but the ride is smooth once you get going. If you're  tall, you may want to think twice as there is little clearance between my head and the interior roof of the car without moving the seat all the way down. The sun visor is also tricky to put down without having to move my head back.  Difficult to get used to after having 2 suv's with more height and flexibility.  ",Panoramic sunroof.  Sound system is good and easy to use.  3rd row seats fold down easily.  Safety and comfort.  More rugged than expected in the snow.,"Very poor front sight lines despite the sensors.  Controls are tricky with the push btn start as well as the ""behind the wheel"" shift key feature, which can easily downshift while driving at high speeds.  Bluetooth activation should be standard.  Navigation system tedious."

We have 4 kids 2 of which in car seats and wow is all I can say about this car. I love that the 2nd row seats can move back and forth allowing for very easy access to the 3rd row which seats my 6ft plus 15 year old very nicely! The pick up is great and it is tons of fun to drive.  Not too mention very pleasing to the eye to look at. I would say so far my only con is that it seems to have a lot of little things go wrong.  Less then a month of owning it the steering column broke in my kids school parking lot and I could not turn the wheels which was scary to say the least.  ",I love the interior features very simple yet very nice. It seems very durable thus far.  I like the sound system and the nav features are very easy to use. I like the address book that allows for phone numbers to be entered. I love the looks of this car.  ,I would say the tv system needs to be redone. I liked my ESV because it allowed for control from the driver seat.  
4.375,"For the Second Time, Bravo!",A.Setiawan ,10/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,3,"This is our 2nd R-class and our umpteenth Benz. We had a R350 and an E- class in LA and now that we've moved to Jakarta, we decided to get another one this time a 7 seater and CDI to combat Jakarta's traffic. Having first bought a Toyota Alphard here, we now find it too big for self-drives and prefer the R-class. The 7 seating version makes better sense and more practical. We've now passed-on the Alphard to the kids for their activities and keep the R-class between my partner and me. We're no longer getting an S-class since the R- class also carries a lot of panache and grandeur without being too overbearing especially when we self- drive on the weekend and during vacation and not use the drive",We like the 7 seating arrangement and fuel economy of the R320 CDI. We also like the panoramic moon-roof although we hardly ever open it in smog-congested Jakarta. The quiet Mercedes-Benz diesel engine is also a big plus as it can sometimes be a little bit mortifying to drive a noisy Benz. Well- done,"Mercedes ought to restyle the tail end of the car so as to not have such a retro look. And for future references, 7 seating right of the bat would be nice, instead of making it an add-on on future models thus shortening the model's life. At any rate, we're looking forward for the upcoming model!"
4.5,Underrated Great Family Crossover ,yetialan ,09/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"Pros: I had an BMW X3 and drove the X5 along with the MDX the MB had the smoothest ride, best safety features (BMW doesnt have third row curtin airbags), 3 rows of seating and the greatest comfort in the third row. Pricing was excellent got almost 16K off a brand new 08 and low 66 month 2.9% financing. Everything top of the line quality, metal feels thick strong and confident on the road. MB originally wanted to sell these in 06 for 60-80K. This was built to be a great cruiser like the s class. Feels like the s class and the panoramic roof is incredible. Cons: Navi not easy to use ","Panoramic roof, auto rear hatch, safety, drive is smooth like butter, does not rock the kids like the BMW X series models, third row can really seat adults, can still move 2nd row seats forward to get to the 3rd row with 2 baby seats in place in the 2nd row.

5,What to call the R-Class...Nice!,Rodney  ,08/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I were in the market to replace our Yukon XL 4x4. We were looking at the GMC Arcadia and Buick Enclave when at the time I became aquainted with an R350 at our research lab for vehicle design and repairability review. With all of the safety features this car provided along with the amazing interior room, the R class was just right for my family of 5. I am a first time MB buyer so this may be the last one I buy or the first of many. We are so very pleased with the vehicle. It drives like a cloud. We thought we would miss the Yukon, but those memories are gone. This car provides for all of our needs and then some. We just love this car!","We have enjoyed having the back-up camera and the park assist feature. The leg room is short of incredible in this car.  We opted for the P2 package, and I'm glad we did as it provides the Nav system and other nice features like the disk changer and I- Pod.","I would think that many of the options should be standard equipment (Nav, DVD, hands-free phone) for a car in this price catagory."
4.875,"R-Class, Where you grow to after a van",Heris ,07/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My title says it all. The R-Class is the vehicle you grow to after the kids are too big for a van anymore. Teens now drive, they're too cool and big to be climbing in a van and this is just perfect. There's room for the drums and trips to the warehouse stores. It's not too tall so you don't get dirty getting stuff out of the back. It's better than a modern wagon. It's better than a van. It's better than I could ever imagine. Mercedes Benz is right on for the people that this was designed for but missing the marketing boat! They really need to interview some of us late 40's crowd. Have hand issues? Weak wrists? Carpal tunnel? You'll love how you shift gears in this jet. Lightly tap a button!","Automatic liftgate, hands free phone, parktronic laser letting you know if you're too close to an object when parking, power seats, quick touch cruise control and gear shifting, huge back trunk space when back seats are folded down, large spacious ride for 2nd and 3rd rows. My teens love this wagon.","More storage up front for large map books, room for a purse or a hook, driver drink holder moved forward, pedal adjustments. Use Hyundai's Hands Free Voice system Vs MB. Include distronics, nav, dvd, leather in base package. Darker sunscreen tint on front, drivers, and front passenger windows."

This vehicle looks sharp,  seats 6-7 very comfortably, and I couldn't be happier driving it!  We average 28 mpg with highway driving, and about 23 in town.  With the back seat down, there is good storage space, and when using the back seat for passengers, no one complains about the comfort back there, as they did in the Suburban.  We are thrilled with this vehicle!",,
5,Why buy the R-Class ,Sheri ,07/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"You'll love this vehicle if you have ""tweens"". Those teens that are not licensed to drive alone, so you still have to haul them and their high school buddies one or two more years. These teens have outgrown the 'soccer mom's van' and they, too, want to look cool if they are still going to have to be chauffeured by Mom or Dad. The driver will love saving your wrists and joints by just having to tap with your finger the steering column wand to change gears. 26 mpg is a deal sealer on this large vehicle. This is such a wonderful vehicle! You need to market to true baby boomers and tween families, such as I described. CALL this vehicle a WAGON... and it ain't yo' mama's wagon of the past","The ParkTronics idiot proof system to help park your car. The automatic lift gate. No more unnatural, painful jerking of my wrists and thumbs to shut a back lift trunk door.  ","Better interior storage space and cup holders.

4.125,Supremely Practical--with compromises,NYC Driver Fam of 5 ,05/05/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,4,5,4,3,"Bought this car after an exhaustive research process into every car with 3 row.  Did not want giant SUV (Suburban, Esalade) and biggest new Lexus did not have comfy back row.  R-Class is extremely comfy in all rows. Middle row even shifts forward allowing additional room in the rear, if desired.  Car runs very smoothly as one would expect from a MB. Middle row appears to have as much leg room as an S-Class and more head room. We opted for the center seat, which is good for child, but not full width. Cargo space with all seats in place is okay, but not great. Rear seats manually fold flat like a minivans. MB did away with the 5.0 litre engine. 3.5 is sluggish and a disappointment.",Love the panoramic roof giving the middle and back rows a glass ceiling. Unbelievably comfy and spacious seats in all rows.  Auto open/close gate is nice. Backup camera (should be standard) is good as well. Park-assist beeps when close to cars in front/back and very useful.,"3.5 litre engine is inadequate. Must've been a cost compromise, but this very large car need more power. Command (nav., radio, etc.) is small screen, not touch screen, not intuitive. Poorly designed even compared to our prev. 5-year old Lexus system. MB should be embarrassed."

Test drove most of the vehicles and finally ended up on the best one. We just love the class and comfort of Mercedes. Though I am bit skeptical about the Merc's notorious reliability, everything is fine so far. It's absolutely quiet inside and got decent accelaration for such a heavy vehicle.

While I loved the handling and styling of the car, I chose the R-class for the room and seating capacity. However I was also surprised with the way the car handles and I really love the styling. I pretty much leave the rear seats down but I like knowing that they are available if needed. I love how long the cargo space is with the 2nd row laid down for extra room If I need to haul longer items. Right now with the great lease and retail programs they have on the R- class, it makes it a great value.","Room, sat radio, I-pod Integration Kit 7-speed transmission, tele-aid, safety features, bucket seats, multifunction steering wheel controls, voice activation, blue tooth phone capability.","CD ripper, module free Bluetooth, auto dimming rearview and sideview should be standard equipment.

4.875,Excellent Vehicle for Our Needs,RPC ,03/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We had a Mecedes wagon with a rear seat but were looking for a vehicle with a larger interior. We also waited for the 2008 that created a 3 person seat in the second row. This vehicle has been everything my wife has wanted and she can handle its size even in tight locations. She loves to drive it. I happen to like to drive it as well. With all the SUVs on the road and having two younger children, we feel much safer in this vehicle, even over the MB wagon. The long wheel base makes for a very smooth drive and ride (even in the 3rd seat that two adults can sit comfortably in). This is definitely a vehicle worth test driving!  It will make you strongly consider it as a purchase option.",I love the panoramic roof with all the glass to see out. It makes sitting in the 2nd or 3rd seat seem much more open. The back-up camera is a great help along with the bumper sensors that let you know if you are coming too closs to an object. The seating is also very comfortable.  ,"The transmission paddles that are on the backside of the steering column could be better placed so that you don't accidently engage them. However, after a couple of weeks of driving, you never know they are there."
5,We love our well-kept secret,MSS ,03/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I practically stumbled across this car when I decided to check out the MB lot just for the heck of it one day. We had been looking closely at the GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave, but I was blown away by the interior size, comfort and luxury touches of this vehicle. Our R class includes fantastic features such as the backup camera, panorama roof (awesome), 6 CD changer, Sirius radio for 6 months, and the 7 seat option. The car rides very well and the torque makes up for what the HP lacks.  Although I should say with three kids, I want exactly looking for massive power -- more for interior space and three rows of seats, which the R class has in spades.","Cavernous room in the interior. Even the third row is generous.  MB quality, smooth yet sporty feel, panorama roof, backup camera, Nav system, michelin tires, easy access to the back row, parktronic, even the Smart Key is cool.","Would like better back visibility. The windshield doesn't appear to have tinting - the sun blares in.  If I'm not careful, I'm going to wreck this car playing with all the toys (Nav, Sirius, CD changer, etc). Shouldn't leather be included at this price point?"
4.75,A perfect compromise,Joe Brasco ,03/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,This car a fantastic family verhicle. Not only does it ride like a Mercedes S-Class but it has the same unrivaled leg room - even in the third row.

It's got the space inside that others have wasted. This is a well designed and very unique car. I would buy again.","3rd row can seat adults in comfort. Panoramic roof has to be seen to be believed. My daughter can actually walk between the 2nd and 3rd row, when parked naturally. Solid throughout. I trust this car with my family's safety.",Cruise control stick gets in the way of the indicator. Rear doors are large but I'm not sure how they can be realistically improved without turning it into a minivan. I think the opening mechanism need more torque or settings. Perhaps some kind of power door. I just know we are going to ding someone
4.875,Versatile luxury,Ralph ,02/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"At first, I went to get a 4 door sedan, therefore I was hesitant to get what I thought of as a ""minivan in disguise"". But the more I drive it, the more I love it! I like the way it handles both on the highway and around the city. It feels like a Mercedes Benz car not a minivan or truck. People love the back seats, and the  plentiful leg room available. The diesel model, which I have, is giving me great mileage per gallon of gas. I love that the seats in the back can be arranged in different configurations, very versatile. It is very luxurious inside. The sound system is excellent.","The seat arrangeament versatility, and the leg room. I like that the trunk door can be opened and close with the remote control. The radio and I-Pod connectivity are also easy to handle,","At this price level, all cars should include GPS as standard. It is a rather expensive option."
4.5,A Family Vehicle with lots of room,Alison ,01/30/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"We needed a family vehicle that could seat 6-7 people comfortably and still provide space for baby gear, groceries or luggage.  We wanted a cross-over type of vehicle, not a monster SUV, and something that still provided luxury, safety and performance.  I have been an Audi driver for the past five years so comfort, performance and safety were key.  After looking at a number of vehicles we decided to look at the R Class. (The Audi Q7 didn't cut it with cubic space.)  I am very pleased with the key factors I had to consider and extremely happy with the space we were seeking.  We chose the P1 package with a couple of extras, the I-pod hook up (I love) and heated seats. ","Easy access, automatic opening and closing of the trunk, i-pod connection, ability to operate many features on the steering wheel and the park-tronic.","Bigger side view mirrors, more HP, lags a bit on acceleration. Bluetooth set up very expensive - should be a standard (safety)feature no matter what. Move the tip-tronic buttons & cruise control arm! I hit them constantly, accidentally & it drives me nuts.

4.25,If you have car seats,"Plano, TX- Mom ",11/25/2007,,,5,4,4,4,,4,5,4,4,"We came across the R350 when looking at the GL450. We have two car seats but needed a 3rd row periodically when my parents are staying with us. You can only access the third row from the passenger side in the GL (and most SUV's)which is difficult for my parents.  We then looked at the R350 and you can access the rear row even with car seats in the 2nd row,from both sides. The 3rd row are real seats and have very good leg room and child seat anchors if needed.  The ride & handling of the car are very good.  We also got the P2 package which gave us some great options, mem seats, nav, HK stereo, hands free phone(w/bluetooth) etc.  After looking at 6 vehicles, we are thrilled with the R350.   ","Easy access, backup camera, navigation and the HK stereo which has 11 speakers, bass, Sirius, 6 disc changer and 450 watts. The hands free phone system with bluetooth module is outstanding!  You can operate all of this from the steering wheel!",I would have liked to have the 500 series engine as a choice.  The rear doors open very wide so be careful not to ding the car next to you.  The factory DVD system is very expensive.  We opted for an after market DVD player w/ wireless. (center roof mounted)- no panoramic roof. $1000 less. 
4.625,The Only Green Luxury Family Utility Vehicle,J R ,10/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"With the 7 seat option now, if you are in the market for a luxury brand to haul a family of 5 + occasional/regular guests, this is the must have. Having done my share of research on 7- Seater SUVs (MDX, Q7, GL etc.), I am not regretting my decision to buy this ""Van or SUV"" vehicle at all. I waited for 2 months after hearing about the 7 Seat option before picking up my 2008 R320 CDI on August 29th.  We get all the 4WD benefits that the SUVs bring and most of the family comforts of a 7 seater Van including, most importantly, a good rear seat which seats adults and not people under 5' alone.  Also, the Mercedes brand has its fair share of luxury inputs to this vehicle. ","A lot of room inside, great seating expecially the 3rd row.  My suggestion, pay the additional $ 1,000 for the Diesel and you will not regret the fewer trips to the gas station. Its a little noisier and slower upto the 20 MPH zone, but after that, you cannot differentiate from a gas engine.","One con and a solution - The trunk is rather small. We have two kids and their Strollers eat into the trunk if we are fully loaded with 7 passengers. However, that did not stop us from our first long outing in this feature loaded car. We just decided to change the way we pack...more Soft Bags."
