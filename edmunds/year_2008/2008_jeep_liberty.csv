If you take care of the vehicle as stated in the Manual, most Vehicles will go well beyond their manufactures warranties.  My first 1986 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, had 135,000 miles on it when I got it.  I sold it with 280,000 miles on it. My 2nd 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee I still own and it's got 336,000 on it.  This Jeep Liberty was very SUPRISING comfortable.

1,Worst vehicle I've ever owned,John ,12/20/2015,1,1,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,"Don't buy this car.  There are too many quality cars available today to waste your time and money on this piece of garbage.  The engine and 6 speed manual transmission are pretty reliable, although poorly suited to the car.  The engine is not powerful enough, has a microscopic power band, and the ratios are just too long.  Below 3000 rpm there's no acceration, and above 4000 rpm it's only good for turning gas into noise.While the powertrain has been reliable, literally every other thing jeep attached to it has not been.  4wd has failed twice for electronics, wiper switches, window switches, door lock switches, airbag sensor, door sensors, gas tank won't fill (replaced twice), shift boot falls apart, seat trim falls apart, spare tire doesn't stay tight and knocks around, wheels seem designed to deliver pebbles to the brake pads, brake pads cannot be secured and rattle constantly, car won't restart when warm, exhaust flex joint cannot be secured and periodically disconnects, entire interior vent system had to be replaced when an internal seal melted and jammed the actuators, multiple hvac fans have failed (noisily), and the list goes on.  And on...I bought this car new with the lifetime powertrain warranty and lifetime maxcare.  Even at $50 per work order and paying $35-$50/day for rental cars while the jeep is in service, it cost me $2000 this year to maintain this POS.  I just dumped the thing yesterday...  I'd kept it for so long because I knew the warranty would protect me when something major failed...  but eventually it bacame clear that the major expenses were not likely to fail, and the car was milking me dry, a few hundred dollars at a times.  At one point this year, I had the car in for repair for three different unrelated issues in one week.  Each time I picked it up, I couldn't even make it back to the house before something else crapped out.  Another time it was in for service for two consecutive weeks, brought it home, and had something else fail the very next day.To wrap this up - do yourself a favor and don't buy this car.",,

As my first big purchase as an adult all on my own, I could not have been more excited about this vehicle. However, in the 4 years I have owned it, I have realized that this was the worst mistake of my life. At first, it wasthe four wheel drive that took a crap, and having never had a chance to use the four wheel drive yet, i was surprised. Then came the Sky Slider leak, and the interior light leak, followed by all four tires dry rotting out causing me to blow a tire while driving. Yet the tires still had at minimum 40% tread left. Then heater core died followed by the blower motor, then we had to replace a computer chip that was causing my ","transmission to lock up and not shift while driving. Then came the brake issues and now it's the radiator. I don't know what else I will have left to replace/fix on this car. It's has all been out of pocket costs, minus the chip. I keep up to date on maintenance and don't quite understand what's wrong with this vehicle. I'm assuming I have really bad luck and got a lemon.

I was paranoid about a mechanic touching my roof and making it worse.  Since the date I purchased the vehicle in August 2008, I had extreme wind noise and the roof would ""puff up"" 1/2"" -1"" in the interior after I reached 65 mph.  The noise was completely unbearable when I drove into a 10-15 mph headwind, it was impossible to carry on a conversation, and very difficult to hear the radio.  Today, I took my Jeep to Ancira Jeep on I-10 West.  Jaye Patton was extremely helpful at the front desk, and the service tech did a marvelous job!  I took my Jeep up to 85 mph on the Interstate ",,

This is my 4th Jeep (99' Cherokee, 04' Liberty, 07' Wrangler Unlimited, 08' Liberty) and the best yet!  The best on-road ride for an off-road SUV. The engine is sluggish on the on-ramp, but ample everywhere else. Tons of unexpected bells and whistles too. Sky-Slider Roof, Sirius Radio, UConnect, MyGig, etc... Very smart with the nooks and crannies too.  The cargo area is adequate and smart. The console and glove compartment are quite large.

We've had 3 major snowstorms in Maine recently and the Jeep performed as though there was no snow on the roads. It's comfortable, handles nicely and forward visibility is great.

This really fits well. The engineers did well with seat comfort, equalizing armrest height and control placement to make for a great experience.  The best news: It looks like a Jeep, it drives like a Jeep and it feels like a Jeep, not a Lexus and fortunately not Toyota. I love the Skyslider, mine is quiet because they performed the TSB and installed a new bow.  The ESP is amazing.  I live in snow country in western New York and I rarely use the 4WD since ESP and all-speed traction control are so effective.

Put this rig above the rest. The V-6 is lack-luster and it doesn't get great mileage in town, but I got 23 MPG on a 2000 mile trip. The seats are very comfortable and even though the foot wells seem crowded, there is plenty of room and I'm a big Norwegian.  I had a 4x4 Escape before and thought that was a great car, but the features, such as: 4 wheel disk brakes and real 4x4 put he Escape to shame. The Jeep didn't even cost any more than the Ford.

4.625,I'm a convert!,Snow Gal ,01/27/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I live in a small town in Alaska where owning the right vehicle is a life or death matter.  You don't want to lose it on some desolate highway, stuck in a snowbank, waiting for someone to drive by while your breath forms sheets of ice on the inside of the windows.  Been there!  I have driven this Liberty in the nastiest weather and it handles like it was made for snow.  I recommend the Selec-Trac 4 wheel drive system over the optional Command-Trac, which is more like AWD with a 4 low option.  Whether there's 6 inches of fresh snow on the road, slush, ice, or I'm just bouncing down the trail to my favorite fishing hole, this Jeep was made for Alaska!

I am disappointed about the defrost capabilities of this. The dashboard defrost only goes to the middle of the windshield leaving both the ends of the windshield hard to get and keep clear. When the semis pass you on snowing roads, keeping the windshield clear is essential. I drive 45,000+ each year and in the sub-zero temps in December, I was on the interstate with semis passing, because of the inferior defrost system, it was impossible to see. I actually had to pull over and scrape ice off the windshield. I am not an expert but I think the dashboard should be recalled.

I like the looks inside and out (vast improvement over 2003-2007). I hate the instrument panel and controls. Those little lights are difficult to see in bright sun.  The radio controls are complicated and poorly positioned, including the 'Set' button next to the first station button. Station buttons don't always work correctly.  I hate that ""Change Oil"" message that's based on time and mileage and unrelated to actual oil changes.  The vehicle seems rugged enough, but the springs squeak, even when you just get in or out.   ","I like the looks (nicer than the Dodge Nitro), 6-spd manual transmission, ground clearance, seats (comfort and fold-down capabilities), and the return to a more masculine design.","Try an AC control I can turn to 'on' instead of pushing the temp knob and getting an indicator light I can't see.

I'm sure it's faster than the old one and I guarantee it is more comfortable. The transmission shifts a bit weird but I'm getting used to it. The 2003 did feel more rugged for off- road abuse, but for what most people use these for, I'm sure the new one will be just fine.","Power, ultra-comfortable seats, sky- slider, stereo is a huge improvement, and I'm glad to be rid of that swinging rear door.

I got an '08 with $9K off in incentives, total cost 15k and the dealer gave me a $1,000 over book on my '02 Jetta trade.  Easily beats a more expensive Toyota or Nissan that would cost $5-6k more.

4.25,Sky Slider,Lisa ,12/06/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,5,5,4,4,"In general, I LOVE my Jeep the one thing I don't like is the Sky Slider. I wish I had just over looked it. Starting about 2 weeks after I got the Jeep, I found the highway wind noise to be unbearable. After 3 dealerships and 4 months, I found some guys that noticed that the weather striping had come up and they replaced it. That has helped the noise a ton but it is still pretty undesirable on the highway. No matter the weather, it seems like roof is just not well designed at all. The cross bars in the sky slider buckle with any amount of wind and sometimes if I attempt to close it while I am driving (even at 30 mph) I am scared the whole thing is just going to fly off. ","Love the MYGIG system, comfort, style, reliability. ","Obviously, fix the wind noise and Sky Slider. It makes me want to return the Jeep and buy something else. I would suggest that everyone with similar problems reports them to Jeep as often and as much as possible. I am praying for a recall that will fix what I was assured would never happen. "
3.75,What's that noise?,Claudia Patrick ,11/15/2008,,,4,4,3,4,,4,4,3,4,"I've had the Jeep Liberty for about 2 weeks.  Before this I had driven a Rodeo. It feels a little more stable than the Rodeo, but the Rodeo had a lot more leg room for both the front and back seats. When you sit in the Liberty, your legs go straight down--you have little room to stretch out your legs, which could be frustrating during a long drive.  One of the first things I noticed was that it hardly has a dashboard. I also test-drove the Jeep Patriot, but that was a 4-cylinder and the steering wheel was disturbingly small.  Between the Pathfinder and Xterra, the Jeep Liberty feels more like the Pathfinder. The Liberty drives more smoothly than the Xterra.  ",It has a nice outer look.  I'm really not bothered by the plastic inside.  It has plenty of space in the back as well as a hidden compartment. I like that the spare is placed underneath as opposed to on the back of the vehicle.  I also like that the back seat can be folded down in sections.  ,"At around 55-60 mph, there is so much wind noise it feels like I'm taking off in an airplane.  The mpg is quite low.  I'm used to having plenty of leg room and the Liberty doesn't. For such a large vehicle you'd think there would be more space for the people riding in it.  "
4.75,2008 Liberty,Roly Oliver ,10/23/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"We own a 2008 Jeep Liberty and found it to be one great vehicle. Suspension, power-rack & pinion steering, compass, temp are just a few of its attributes. We had a 2005 Liberty. This is heads above that one.  We had a holiday into Muskoka and got 22 mpg. I am sure cruise control contributed to it. I must say headlight illumination is poor. One must dive on low beam and fog lamps. Consumer reports gave it a poor rating. They keep comparing it to a Nitro. It's not a Nitro.  We like the plastic interior (it's not a touring car) It is easy to keep clean, not cheap.

3.75,Expected a little more,Liberty Limited ,10/19/2008,,,5,4,3,3,,3,4,3,5,I have very mixed feelings with my Jeep. Aesthetically it looks nice inside and out yet once you begin to familiarize yourself with the SUV you begin to notice the abundance of plastic both inside and out. Cheap plastic that scratches easily. The MPG sticker says 20 mpg on the hwy. True if you reset the gauge doing 55 mph on a flat low wind hwy. 16-17 mpg combined city/hwy is realistic. The drive train should have been updated with the rest of the Jeep. Same drivetrain as in the previous version/yrs. Normally this would be a good thing however the additional 200-300 lbs that the vehicle gained with the remodel has made it lethargic from a stop and forcing the trans to constantly look for a gear. ,"Easy read display on Nav. Satellite Radio. It is easy to drive. Instrument panel is big, easy to read yet not obtrusive. Controls are logically placed. 4wd works well in snow. Remote start works well. Memory features are nice, when my key is recognized the seats adjust as do the mirrors, even radio","Put a some hydraulic hinges on the hood. Heavy hood. By the way, changing the oil is a nightmare.

4.5,Liberty is under rated,Dan ,10/14/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"It appears that the Liberty is under rated by most review sites and is a very good vehicle if it meets your needs. I drive dirt roads almost daily and not all vehicles can take that pounding.  The car is functional, rides comfortable and can handle the back roads.  Made sure to get the all terrain tires (all of the vehicles at dealerships were 4x4 but only a few dealerships had the all terrain tires) and the Jeep green color is nice as well.  Ample storage space inside and fun to drive as well. Although gas mileage is below average the vehicles are selling well below the competition and that more than makes up the difference.  Only down side appears to be a little too much wind noise.",Off road ability but perfect for regular driving as well. Jeep green color.

Get the cargo area plastic tray from Mopar; fits perfectly and it can be easily removed to shake out dirt/mulch. Braking is sure and even. Outside mirrors are overlarge - great for backing-up.

The exterior looks are aggressive and the 3.7 L engine has plenty of PEP. It did fine hauling 2 moto's on a trailer also.

We love it and couldn't be happier with our decision to trade in an '06 V6 Commander for this one. Some reviews claim that it lacks a bit of power. Maybe it does, but to me it's got plenty of juice. Think about it, it is the same engine they put on the V6 commander but having to handle over 1200 lbs less. In my opinion the engine moves it pretty good.

Airbags all over with great crash test ratings makes the wife happy, and for a truly capable off-road 4x4, it handles comfortably on and off road through all weather. Bring on the potholes.","The rag top sky slider, I like having a convertible SUV at the touch of a button, can't wait for beach weather. 115-volt outlet, fold down seats, powerfull/ comfortable ride. Not overly top heavy on sharp turns. Jeep 4x4 performance. Lifetime Powertrain Warranty. Sound system w/ MP3 port. Its design","Better pick up response when accelerating at highway speeds... and of course, better MPG... but for a truck with its proven performance and its well equipped standard features available for well under $30k, how much complaining can one do. To outclass this Liberty, you'll have to spend a lot more money"
4.875,Sky Slider is awesome,JB ,02/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased a Limited with a Sky Slider top, which I have to say is awesome. Nice to be one with nature. The 5 star frontal and side crash rating was a big plus. The ride is great, handles great in snow and ice...even better than my Grand Cherokee.  Inside is roomy and comfortable, even for my 6 ft plus 16 year old son.   I have the Limited fully loaded.  For a Jeep, the new Liberty feels more like a luxurious crossover.  It gets a lot of looks from people...sharp looking!  I would purchase this vehicle all over again.  The MyGig, Sirius radio and Sirius Traffic, heated seats and mirrors, remote start, navigation are wonderful options!  It's a trail rated Jeep, what more can one expect?!","My Limited is about fully loaded.  I love the MyGig with navigation, Sirius radio and Sirius Traffic, ability to plug in my iPod.  The heated seats, mirrors, and remote starter are nice for New England winters.  But my absolute favorite feature is the Sky Slider top.",My only complaint is I wish it got a little better gas mileage.  But it gets about the same as my Grand Cherokee.

4.875,08 Liberty Misunderstood,Rogie ,02/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I researched the heck out of the Liberty.  I had owned  Liberty in the past and just recently returned a leased Pacifica, a nice sleeper itself. To make a long story short, I don't understand all the mediocre expert reviews, including the 9th out of 9 finish in a recent big magazine. Those reviews turned me off of the Liberty..but I kept coming back to it since it seemed far more inspiring than the boring Rav4, CRV and Escape. The reviews on Edmunds from real people convinced me to stick to my convictions that this vehicle is a quiet gem. I took the plunge and now have one.  I love it. 30K and feature rich. No way Rav4, CRV and others can touch it for all around fun factor.

4.75,Great snow/bad weather vehicle,Keno90 ,02/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I traded my Dodge Ram 4x4 in on this vehicle and I am very happy with my trade. We just got 11 inches of snow on Thursday and I live in a very rural location with a 600' gravel drive on a very steep incline. The vehicle did a fantastic job with only the all weather tires that came standard! I love the interior and the way the vehicle handles. Have not really checked the mileage yet, nor do I know how reliable the vehicle the will be, but I have owned 4x4's from Wranglers to Chevy and Dodge trucks and this one is just as good for on road snow driving!","Interior controls, exterior design, warranty, snow handling.",Lights don't seem to be very bright and the hard plastic center console needs to be made of something soft.
4.625,Almost bought something else,Douglas ,02/01/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,3,5,"Having had the 2004 Liberty and hating it since 2 days after delivery, I was a bit skeptical about the 2008 model.  However, a test drive changed my mind.  I was quite surprised at the additional room as the specs don't really convey real world use.  Who thinks in cubic feet?  My 6'3"" partner is comfortable in the driver and passenger seats.  The ride is definitely improved and the styling is great.  The vehicle feels a lot more solid.  My only regret is not getting the Limited model as I really miss the electronic seats and the EVIC.  Also, ignore professional reviewers who insist on comparing it to crossovers.  That's not the same category!",The ride and size.,"Better gas mileage, dampened/rubberized storage to reduce rattling noise of items inside"
4.875,1st Impression 2008 Jeep Liberty Limited,JD59 ,01/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just picked up a new 2008 Jeep Liberty Limited with leather, sunroof, remote start, tow pkg, & heated seats. All I can say is wow, this is a nice Jeep. I had a 2004 Wrangler Unlimited that I loved, but the lease was up, and it was time to trade again. I went with the Liberty Limited, since it had so many standard safety features, and slightly better gas mileage then the new Wranglers, plus the incentives were better for the Liberty.","Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC), heated seats, premium Sirius satellite radio, leather interior, automatic tire pressure monitoring (TPM) system, and lifetime warranty.","Daa, gas mileage.

4.875,Love my Jeep,bgrn ,01/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded a 2002 Ford Explorer full size with 102,000 miles, wanted a smaller vehicle with the features of the big suv. I was not disappointed. This Jeep is great! Although smaller it still has plenty of room. It does slip on snow covered roads sometimes when not in 4wd but just a flip of the switch and there is no stopping it. Very smooth ride. I test drove the old ones 3 years ago these are far better. It sits high off the ground and I can't wait to take it down the sand at the beach, got the skid plates intalled for this. I drive in this all day for a living and I love it. Mileage isn't awful, my Explorer was 13mpg/this does better than that approx 17-18.","Sun roof, Sirius satellite radio, the color greystone pearl, the height, the smooth ride.

3,Wow is this thing bad in the snow,jetchef ,01/07/2008,,,3,3,3,4,,3,3,3,2,"Wow this thing is terrible in the snow. It feels like the back end is going to slide out at any time even when going straight. The steering and road feel inspire no confidence. The factory tires are awful, I feel bad for Jeep that it has come to this, you have to wonder what the future of the brand is. This truly is a bad SUV. There are so many better trucks out there. If you buy one immediately get new tires, the stock Goodyears are dangerous. By the way ever time the rear end slid out no traction control engaged, ever.",I've had SUV's with worse gas mileage.,"Better tires, ergonomics, storage and seats. "
4.875,Excellent,npro1234 ,01/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I like my 2008 Sport 4x4 Liberty.  It is much more comfortable than my old pickup truck. Gas mileage is as reported (4x4 15/21 mpg).  I just took a trip of 900 miles loaded with my stuff (2wd mode) in the cargo area to confirm. This SUV is way off the ground and from measurements up to the antenna stands about 6' 6"".  So be sure it can fit into your garage. The response seems a bit sluggish when accelerating, but it is a heavy vehicle. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.","Smooth ride, comfortable seats, high off the ground, tinted windows, 4x4",Improved blindspot when looking left.
4.625,3rd Jeep & Cherokee Satisfaction,davis ,01/07/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I've previously owned a 1990 Cherokee and a 2001 Cherokee Sport, both great vehicles. This new Liberty redesign was the perfect fit for my family now and my wife loves it, despite some reviews of it being too masculine.  It's a pretty incredible vehicle and the fact that you can get a fully loaded, roomy real Jeep SUV for ~30k is amazing.  I was very sad when Jeep discontinued the classic Cherokee in '01, but the new styling, size and features on the Liberty definitely show that it is the real successor to that line.","Ripping cds to the HD is really awesome, that paired with SIRIUS means we literally don't have to carry around ANY cds anymore.","5 speed auto, but then that seems to be most people's suggested improvement on a lot of vehicles now days. My new '08 GMC Sierra could use a 5 speed there too, so hopefully we'll all see the auto makers pony up in the next few years."
4.375,Great vehicle,D. Kissell ,01/06/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,3,4,"Really nice Jeep, pretty comfortable to drive/ride in, has a lot of good features for the price.  Seems a little smaller on the inside than it looks from the outside, but there's adequate storage space.  Pretty good value and a great warranty program and has a 5-star crash rating.","Comfortable ride, good ride height, not too loud, great warranty, pretty responsive, standard airbags all around, very solid, safe car.","Small thing - no grab handles in the front, no overhead storage for sunglasses, wish mpg were a little better, driver's seat is a little cramped (but I'm 6'2"" so I get that a lot)."

So I started to shop around - drove several other smaller model SUVs but none felt as ""tough"" as the Jeep. AFter all, Jeep served me well over th eyears with virtually no car problems and I have never gotten stuck.

4.75,Everything I was looking for and more,Charryl ,12/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I traded in my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee V8 with regret, but with 160K miles! I wanted a smaller SUV but with big SUV features. The Liberty has it all.  I live at high altitude with big hills. My biggest concern was performance.  The Liberty never loses a beat on the climb. Toys and features were the next concern and Liberty met that challenge, too. The combined nav system, sound system, satellite radio, bluetooth, 20 GB memory for capturing CDs (no more books of CDs to carry around!), customized photo display, etc., etc. makes the road experience nothing but a big smile.  Interior room with my third concern. Plenty of storage--both for passengers and everything they carry.","The styling, nav/bluetooth/satellite system ease of use (totally intuitive), the sound system is terrific, the feel of the drive.","Seats are a little stiff.

4.75,Second Liberty,Rick M ,11/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I work in broadcast engineering, and need a vehicle to go offroad on some very rugged roads. This is my second Jeep Liberty and is replacing a 2004 Liberty Sport. The 2008 has a lot more passenger and cargo room. It's ride is a lot smoother and quieter, both on and off road. The radio is a drastic improvement over my 2004 Liberty. I'm not sure why Edmunds and other reviewers keep comparing the Liberty to a RAV 4 or Ford Escape.  The Liberty has no competition in it's class.  The 2008 Liberty Sport comes with a lot of features that were only available as options on the previous year's Limited models.  Temp guages, Compass, Tire Pressure Monitoring, Side Air Bags, ABS Brakes, etc ","Interior cargo and passenger room. The ride is very quiet, compared to previous Libertys. The radio, including RDS display and an Aux input jack for Ipod, Zune, or other MPEG player.  My Zune sounds great through the Liberty speakers.","Fuel mileage, but hey, it's a Jeep, and it's about what I expected for a true 4X4.  Headlights leave a lot to be desired, especially on high beams.  Low beams with fog lamps are great, but high beam just doesn't get it.  Maybe different bulbs will help. "
4.875,So Far So Good,Sartori ,11/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We've had our Liberty now for close to a month and no problems so far. It's mainly my wifes daily driver and she uses it as part of her job at the school(home school liason) so it gets put through the paces every day with city and highway driving. We live 16 miles from town and about 5 miles of gravel. Plenty of power, very sporty to drive. Got to test it on some slippery streets the other day and it handled that very well with the ESP kicking in. I stopped on a pretty icy hill and with it in 4 wheel took off just fine. Very nice ride in all conditions, will probably swap out the tires here pretty soon as the stock Wranglers aren't the best.

I traded in an '04 Liberty for this more comfortable ride and more options. I have to say I pushed the '04 Liberty when it came to off-roading and it performed beyond my expectations - it hung in there with the Rubicons (!!). Now with the '08, so far my off- roading tests have been excellent experiences- and all the while offering more comfort. I like the reliability of Jeep - esp. with a long daily commute and the capability to off road/tackle snow. It's excellent! I haven't tested the hill descent control (yet), but will soon. I plan to upgrade the tires to gain more traction/trailer a sailboat/launch in slick conditions.",Nice quiet ride. The sterio/sound system is terrific. I enjoy the remote start and use it just about every day--  and the cargo stowage area for muddy/damp gear and groceries is great. The personal settings display is bright and easy to use/change in a hurry - and the alarm is loud- works well!,For the price a hitch should be included in the Limited model. Other than this - I don't have any. Smooth quiet ride and very comfortable. I can't wait to play in the snow.

This is my first Jeep,  I have always liked  the Grand Cherokee,  but  never  bought one,  but you know I sat in one  and  my Liberty has more headroom and legroom in the  back seat. So far in a  week, I think its a pretty solid vehicle. There is  just a bit of wind noise around the right side of the windshield,  Bt I read that  is because of the boxy shape.  but overall I am enjoying  it, there is so much for the price..",I like the sunroof one touch feature and  the bluetooth.

The mpg and price is better than previous Liberty models but could stand to be improved a little further. The interior design and placement of controls are well thought out.
