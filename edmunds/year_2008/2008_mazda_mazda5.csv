The low profile wheels don't last and are fairly expensive to replace. In addition, our transmission gave out in year 2 and had to be completely replaced (luckily all covered by the warranty). Also, the wheel alignment is not great (perhaps lending to the massive tire consumption) nor are the shocks at this point. So the ride is less than smooth.

4.25,very good car for small family,dandepriest ,04/15/2014,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,5,4,"To be honest, at my age, I kind of miss the roominess and lush comfort of the Chrysler Town and Country we once had. But for value, fuel economy, utility, and reliability I can't say I've ever owned or even known of a better car than our Mazda 5 Grand Touring van. We've put 50K miles on it over two years. A lot of long trips. It's a bit compact for a van but it does seat six comfortably, although two adults in the rear-most bench seat would eventually feel a bit cramped on a long trip. And with six people on an over-night trip there won't be much room for luggage so pack light. The manual indicates that the Mazda 5 is not designed for towing and that it should never be used for that. Howeve","fuel economy, utility, reliability, reasonable comfort",Perhaps more adjustability for the driver's seat and powered adjustment would be great for us old guys.

Fuel economy ranges from 23 in town to 30 on the highway (driving at 70 without cargo box.)Overall average of 25 mpg, usually with 3 kids inside.","Completely reliable since we have owned it. Economical and smooth to operate, with an agile feel while driving. Sliding doors are light enough for our girls to operate most of the time.
Great visibility out the front. Strong lighting from headlights.
Versatile interior.
Good looking when it is clean -- the LED taillights, low-profile wheels and tires, and overall lines look more sophisticated than your typical crossover/family truckster.","If you are wide of girth, this isn't the car for you.
I'm comfortable (I am 5'10"" and 175 lbs), but larger folks will notice that the seats are small.
We have encountered some of the groaning suspension noises, but independent mechanic can't find a problem -- the noises are just an occasional nuisance.
Power is modest on the highway, though the engine is smooth. Stability control only became standard in 2010 -- not available before -- the 2010 models are the one to have. OEM tires should be better quality -- the replacement Continental DWS tires that I installed were much more refined and durable. I would have loved a diesel option for better fuel economy."

Recently, the AT light came on. I took it to our local reliable mechanic. The car now needs a new transmission. I called and pleaded our case with the local Mazda dealership and with Mazda US. Neither of them will do anything to help us. They won't even offer discounted parts. It is ridiculous that the transmission would fail at 65,000 miles.

We had a roof dvd player installed later and it saved us on long trips.","It needs a bigger engine.
The engine does not have enough power for the size of vehicle that it is.
It needs traction control and all wheel drive.
I understand that traction control is now standard on the new models.
It also needs standard side curtain air bags for the entire car not just the front.

Performance is good. We had the power steering defect for which Mazda has a technical service bulletin and are hoping they will recall it (there is a recall in Canada) because the tab was $600+ for the repair. Uneven tire wear is a problem. They wore unevenly early generating a wowwowwow sound. Wheel alignment must be on the outer fringes of possible to correct this. There is not enough travel for the driver's seat. Another inch or two of driver leg room is badly needed. Overall, it is a very good package and I would buy again esp. if driver position is improved","Size, overall concept, flexibility, visibility are all great.  Six seats with rear folding seat is very useful.  Sliding rear side doors are a best feature.  Rear seat leg room is excellent; could sacrifice a bit to gain more drivers' seat travel.",Needs more driver leg room. Might help if raising the seat did not move the seat forward so much.

Get four snow tires. 205/50/17 all season tires were never meant for snow!","Handling, features on the Grand Touring like Bluetooth and Xenon headlamps, fuel mileage, the hiding places in the interior,exterior styling.  The 5 is still fairly rare in my area, so I don't see another one everyday,which is kinda fun!","OK, power is not the 5's strong point. Please Mazda, bring the turbo-diesel from Europe for this vehicle (143 hp 260 ft.lbs. of torque and 38 mpg city!) Some of the plastics are a bit cheap feeling inside and I'd like a bit more storage for the front passengers."
3.875,It's Okay but I would not buy another,crankychick ,05/12/2009,,,3,4,4,3,,4,3,5,5,"Have had our vehicle for over a year.  Power steering keeps cutting out, brakes squeak like mad in the rain,  dealer seems unable to fix either problem.  We drive 34,000 km per year, are a family of 5 with 3 smaller sized teens, this is our only car. No where in the middle seats to put a drink down (our vehicle does not have the under seat fold out holder - which is annoying in itself).  The back window never seems to stay clean, no matter how often we wash it, car washes seem to never get the whole back of the car.  It is fun to drive, and looks great, gets excellent mileage BUT it is uncomfortable, and the person in the back row is either hot or cold.  Needs AWD for North American snow","Love the look of the car, the sliding door panels, and it is fun to drive.  The wipers come on automatically when it rains - love that feature!","Must have AWD for Northern Climates, power windows should be able to go up even if car is off!

The kids love the sliding doors, and the storage under the seats.  My wife and I love the excellent gas mileage.  It is easy to drive - perfect for around town.  Turns on a dime and has plenty of zoom.  The other night I helped a friend move two couches - no problem with the seats down.  Interior space is surprisingly large.

There were about a half dozen other cars who hit the same tire. Only suffered minor damage to front end (a little expensive to fix) whereas the other cars required a tow to get home we drove off just fine.  The rear seats can fir full-sized adults (6' 200lbs males) for sort durations, but are great for smaller adults and children.  With the third row folded it takes most everyday challenges. LOVE the sliding doors and small size compared to other minivans.  We can open the rear hatch with the garage door closed. Parking in a crowded parking lot is a blast, you can even park 'against the grain'! Love IT!",The sliding doors and third room seating option.  Great fuel economy.  Nice looking car.  The white exterior with light colored fabric interior along with tinted windows keeps this cooler in desert summers by 15-20 degrees!

The front passenger seat is so small it's claustrophobic, useless trunk with 3rd row up, 2nd row barely fits 2 small kids and their back packs.  The worst vehicle I've had in 35+ years of driving.  My 13 year old van I got rid of for this car was far superior.  AC is not intuitive.  Car is too narrow to fit my soccer foldable chair in.

You might get more room from a full size minivan, but you also will only get 16-17 mpg in the city.  I have received 23-25 mpg in the city and 28 highway.  I bought this car used after I had a chance to rent one.  The third row is small but is just fine for your kids.  I have sat back there and wouldn't mind sitting there for around town outings.  It's just nice to have the option to transport up to six people occasionally.  I owned a 2002 Protege which was a litte unrefined regarding road noise.  This is no Lexus but definitely is improved and more than satisfactory, even on the highway.  ","Exterior styling, low price, fuel economy, third row seating, good safety ratings, generous standard features, the power is satisfactory with enough acceleration ability.","A liitle more power would be nice but not at the expense of fuel economy.

It's sleek design makes me feel like I am in a space shuttle. :) The fabric is easy to clean. I live in a small town with no highways, so driving around I get 29-30 mpg...which is awesome!! The price was decent too. Never thought that I would own a Mazda...went to buy a Nissan truck with my husband and saw this vehicle and fell in love. I am so happy that we bought it. Plus, the Mazda version of AAA is really reliable. ",Sliding doors. Hatchback. The fuel economy. The 2nd row tray that you can fold into the seat. Arm rests. 2 rows of folding seats.

We have 2 teens, and most of the time the 3rd seat is folded flat. Much usable space this way, and easy to convert if hauling more kids around.  Tough going in the snow, the GT wheels look cool, but the wide, low profile tires are tough in the snow.  As I told my wife, they do plow here, and we only had issue when everyone else did too, so no biggie.

We also love how sporty it drives, how well it parks and fits in the garage, and the zesty copper paint!","Heated seats, I-Pod port, stereo sounds great, climate control, adjustable headlights, and the trick 2nd row seats, fuel economy, (25 mph avg so far) with a smaller tank to save $ at the pump!","anti-skid would be nice, along with a change dish and longer front seat bottoms.

4.5,6 month review,Mark ,02/23/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"Well we have had our 2008 mazda5 sport for over 6 mos now and figured it was time to give our thoughts.  First living in a snowy, hilly area the winter handling and hill climbing power are both average at best. It lags at hill climbing, especially at highway speeds.  Fuel efficiency has been pretty good maybe even a little better than rated. The interior design is very accommodating &comfortable. The rear seats are easy to fold/unfold and the design of the controls is very intuitive.  Cargo space with the third row up is minimal but with it down we can easily fit our two week groceries and more in the back.  Reliability has been perfect so far. Black interior impossible to keep clean.",Cruise and radio controls on steering wheel. MP3 Jack which will also allow you to plug in a portable dvd player.

4.875,Comfortable with power to spare!,SHAWN HILL ,12/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"We purchased the Mazda5 to replace an aging and not very fuel efficient Ford Freestar minivan.  As we still needed a vehicle that could sit at least 6 people but we wanted something more economical the scope of our search was limited. After test driving the Ford TaurusX, Rio Rondo and the Mazda5 and comparing the prices for each it was quickly obvious that the Mazda5 was the best choice. After 6 months of use we are thrilled with our choice.  We've been getting 26 mpg in all around driving and 30 mpg on exclusively highway miles.  The engine has plenty of pep and you can chirp the tires at a moments notice.","FUEL ECONOMY! Spacious interior, comfortable seating (even for adults in the third row of seats).  Plenty of power - the 4cyl, 153hp engine has MORE than enough power to get you going even loaded with 4 adults, packed with gear and a 17 ft canoe strapped to the roof.","Roof rails are a MUST!  Incorporate the ""karakuri"" 7th seat for the North American model.  A change/coin tray would be nice."

About 23-25 mpg in LA traffic, but I did log 31 mpg going to San Francisco with 3 adults and 2 kids.  Took me a long time to decide between the new CRV to the 5, but I sincerely believe that I made the right choice.

Cons: non-lighted mirrors, small useless cubbies without lids, industrial looking fabric, door ajar light doesn't specify which door, gas cap is very hard to get off, wimpy horn, can't close windows with car off, small sunroof, would switch volume with placement of radio change buttons (don't change volume often, but you always change stations, add on/off button), cubbie under middle seat can't be accessed while driving, sunshade is too short-useless, light in truck have off/on/door, armrest must be up to access back. ","Fun to drive, just wish it was a foot longer and a foot wider.  The six seats is a big plus, that's what sold me on the car (since most small SUVs are only 5 seaters).","Parking brake come up farther to be seen; switch places on key fob so unlock is on top, hard to find in dark; don't like lit dash (think headlights on when they aren't & when I turn car off, the dash goes off even when headlights on); smaller back pillars with bigger back window, plus above."

I didn't like the style at first. The car grows on you. All my neighbors compliment the car every time I see them. It's great for a small family. My 2 and half year old loves having his own seat too. The only down fall is my stroller fits on an angle. Also, the automatic car starter from Mazda is awesome. It worth every penny.","seating, auto climate control, control options on steering wheel, Sliding doors, storage under the 2nd row seats, and all the cup holders.

5,My New Mini- MiniVan !,NAA ,11/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We were looking for good gas mileage, the right price with optional 6 passenger seating when we spotted a 2008 Mazda 5. It is easy for the kids to open the sliding doors to get in and out. The second row seating is comfortable and has a great bin for toys and cups. Now I can pick up my friends kids or transport family when I need to. The Mazda 5 third row folds down so easily when not in use. I can't believe the ergonomic storage room . I bought a snow blower for my husband and there was no problem sliding it in the back of the car with room to spare.  My 6'4 husband fits in the drivers seat but the glove box in the pass is tight. We are pleased with the overall performance of the 5.",I love having the phone and radio/cd controls on the steering wheel. Heated seats and bluetooth are great! The sliding side doors are great in tight places. Comfortable arm rests. The easy folding third row is great and allows for good cargo area. The 5 is fun to drive! ,Warning to families with little ones- my 5 year old got his hand closed in the sliding door. He reached up there as I was sliding the door from outside. Luckily the weather striping saved him. Automatic doors with warning would be nice but would come at a price. Also TCS. We bought snow tires as well

First, the gas mileage is awesome... 39 mpg on my recent road trip. Easy vehicle to work from. Sliding doors help. No mechanical issues, noises, squeaks or rattles. Really solid car. However, I miss the comfort of my Volvo. The seat bottoms are too short, and too narrow. The climate controls are way too complicated. The gas & brake pedals are too close together. As others have noted, the interior plastics are poor quality, and scuff easily. Storage is sparse. Map pockets in the doors are preferred to the bottle holders. There is a storage pocket behind the driver's seat only. ","Reliability, gas mileage, unique styling, small turning circle for a front drive car, reasonable price.","More accessible storage, less complicated climate controls, eliminate ""rain sensing"" wipers, improve seat design, really CHEESY jack. Side sill extensions prevent installation of front mud guards, hence I'm constantly removing tar splashes from paint. Hood prop rod... please use gas lifters instead."
5,I love this car!,Jay and Emme ,10/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Mazda5 has been one of the most fun cars I've owned. After finding out we were going to become a family of six rather than five, we needed a vehicle that could hold us all and traded in our sedan. We already have a large minivan and I wanted something better on gas and a bit sportier, so we bought the Grand Touring.  The four kids fit fine, though it is umbrella stroller only as there is almost no trunk space. Trips require use of the luggage rack with 5+ people.  I love the nimbleness in traffic and the tight turn base and size makes parking a breeze. It definitely has some zoom-zoom compared to other family vans.  The 5 is fun to drive, has nice features and I get about 26 mpg.","The Mazda5 displays welcomes you when turn on with a friendly, ""Hello!""  The automatic stuff is nice, including climate control, lights (which you can also turn off) and even the wind-shield wiper.  The GT5 has integrated Bluetooth with very good call clarity. Phone/radio controls on the wheel.",That the radio stay on when the key is taken out until the door is opened. That the electrical plug-ins work with the key out.  The Japanese model comes with optional remote control side doors.  Roof rack would be much nicer if vertical.  Why a left side gas tank? Driver's side easier to fill.
4,Perfect Size,kb ,10/18/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"My wife and I bought a Copper Red Touring model just two weeks ago, after I spent almost a full year researching the 5. We have two young boys and only occasionally need to carry extra passengers, so this vehicle will be perfect for us. We leave the third-row seats folded flat, and it provides more cargo area (and more versatile use of that area) than a typical sedan.  I find the ride rather comfortable -- a little stiff on pavement seams, but I think that's a deliberate trade-off Mazda made to achieve the sportier handling in line with its corporate image. And it does handle very nicely. This is our first Mazda, so we're hoping it will be as reliable as the Hondas we've had. So far so good.","All four rear seats fold down independently, making the cargo area quite versatile; handling; lots of standard features for the price; most of the benefits of a full-size minivan without the higher price and poor fuel economy; unique and sporty styling.","A little lacking for places for the front passengers to put stuff -- the center console is small and has no lid, and there is no real storage on the dash other than the glove box."

It has tons of room for a wagon or my bike plus room for the children.  They can open the doors and get in themselves which is a blessing.  And it's so much fun to drive.  It's the best part of going to work.  :)  I haven't enjoyed a car this much since I had my beloved old Escort.","They styling is like minivan eye candy.

I like the features but I totally dislike the stiff leather seats and the stiff ride. The road noise, harshness and vibration are pronounced. We used to have an 05 Toyota Sienna and this is not even a mile close to the comfort of it. This vehicle does have its strengths too but riding comfort is not one of them. I tried the other trims later, the sport and the touring with fabric seats, for comparison and they ride way better than the GT with leather, but still not even close though to the Sienna that I used to have.

Gas mileage is about what was estimated (actual- 22 city, 30 highway), which is good for a minivan.  For a family of 4, each person gets their own seat with a huge trunk (rear seats down), with the option of ferrying a couple of friends around for short trips.  For the price and value, I don't know why I don't see more on the road (although I see more in Canada).  Only issue that I see so far is the front grille seems too low to the ground and I worry about hitting it on a concrete divider when parking in a public lot.","Car seats, controls","Sun roof for the manual, please"

Choice was RAV-4 UNTIL she drove Mazda 5.  Fun to drive, seat layout, and cargo space won her over.  The after-thought car became the obvious choice.  She absolutely loves everything about it.

I needed a larger car to accommodate my growing family (baby #2 is on the way).  The Mazda 5 is perfect for my needs.  Even though it is very compact on the inside, it is surprisingly roomy on the inside.  It is easier to drive than a big, clunky mini-van.  I can even fit it in most compact parking spaces.  In addition it can seat 6, although I wouldn't recommend this car for a family of 4 unless you're not in need of much trunk space.  The trunk is plenty roomy enough to fit my jogging stroller and groceries with the third row seats down, and the gas mileage is really good for a vehicle it's size.  ",1. Gas mileage: (this was a huge selling point for us) 2. Trunk size: (with 3rd row seats down) 3. Comfort 4. Compact on the outside yet roomy enough on the inside for a family of 4 5.

The trunk is very small with the 3rd row seats in use, but this seems to be a problem with most crossover vehicles. 2. Headrests sometimes wobble if moved up to high.

I'm very impressed with Mazda. Very well priced for what you get, for what is standard on this car, is usually a option on most others. It's a great solution for families that need the seating capacity of a SUV or minivan. The sticker price is less, and your gas bill will be a whole lot less.

We looked at the RAV-4 with a third-row seat and the Highlander, but decided to test the Mazda.  We immediately loved the handling, seat configuration, fuel economy, and general versatility! It is also quite unique - and several of our friends have been really impressed by it.

It is the first time I have heard my wife say about a car that is good looking.  If you need a sports vehicle with the space but not the looks and feel of a bus go get it!",Everything,None
5,A great sporty space wagon to drive,coolmazda5 ,12/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"2nd Mazda5 I own. No other family car compares to the versatility, looks, fuel economy and handling","Sporty looks, versatility, great handling, close turning ratio.",A MazdaSpeed5?
4.875,A great small family car to own and driv,coolmazda5 ,12/14/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,5,5,"I own a 2006 and a 2008 Mazda5s. The purchase experience process for the 08 was much better and easier due to the fact that the dealer was friendlier, less pushy, knew more about the car and knew how to drive manual. It also helped that I knew exactly what I was looking for and that it was available.","Versatility, handling, fuel economy, manual transmission available, very nice look-n-feeling, value for price",None so far. From the 06 to the 08 all the  issues and enhancements have been addressed in my opinion
5,Best 6 passenger... period,TampaRon ,12/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this car. It is by far the most under appreciated car on the road. Even though it's been out for a while people look at it and don't know what it is. It's fun to drive, economical, practical and sporty enough to have fun in the mountains of NC which I visit often. The adjustable second row seats are great.",Love the sliding rear doors and the sporty looks. The ease of entry and generous storage bins are helpful with kids.,I would love it if there were armrest on the inside rear doors. It's not very comfortable without any there. The seats are top notch though. More power would be nice but I think the 08's 5 speed transmission will help that.
4.75,Mazda5 hits a homer! What a great car!,mazda5forme ,10/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"My wife loves her 2007 Mazda5, and now I have an '08! All the things we complained about have been responded to and fixed by Mazda! They added rear A/C vents, more arm rests, better navigation system, redesigned the dash, HID headlights, LED tailights and more! Best build quality of any brand I've owned, faultless as a matter of fact. Exterior paint is also perfection! Made in Mazda's factory in Japan, and it shows the attention to careful build quality. Amazing! ","As said above, perfect quality, feels like a car costing 2 to 3 times as much. Lots of features. ","Still needs a peppier engine, needs window tint so the puny A/C can cope with hot weather."
4.625,The best 3 row 6 seater in the USA!,tacoman1 ,10/17/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"We looked at all competitors.   Hands down the best vehicle for the price.  Lots of standard features, and we bought a sport (base) model.  Rondo was weird looking.  Others were nice, but much more expensive.  Car handles extremely well and is very fun to drive.",Sliding side doors and sporty handling.,Armrest on front passenger seat. Remote keyless start should be standard.
