5,Best sports sedan for the money,vl1505 ,07/13/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Being a mechanic and car enthusiast, I've driven hundreds if not thousands of cars. The only vehicle on the road that's overall better than 350 is 450h. 350 has plenty of power, it's comfortable, roomy, interior materials are very high quality and are well-assembled. Navi, cam, BT are superb. Ride quality is smooth, no cabin noise.. I could talk about GS's styling and performance all day, but it won't convince most potential buyers to lean toward purchasing this beautiful piece of machinery. Even under warranty you have to change oil, filters and brakes. Call Lexus dealer and you'll be pleasantly surprised that GS parts cost about same as Corolla. And I don't recommend buying a warranty","Interior, wheels, electronics, ride quality",

Never had any issues with it.  Right now with about 35,000 on it, it has never been in the shop.  It does not compare to a BMW or BENZ, I have owned both.  I got sick of the HIGH repair costs on the Beamer that drove me to this car.  It is a very well made car with tons of cool tech stuff that I'm too busy to learn about.   CONs: If you are used to BMW or BENZ this car has a lot more road noise.  I ended up just living with it because it's super reliable and actually we traded my wife's M-roadster for a Lexus 400 and love that car too.  ",Nice NAV and gadgets.

This is a nice car, but with the amount of issues and the price I would never recommend it.

Acceleration is excellent, handling is very good, the seats are comfortable and the sound system is superb.  However, the navi, Bluetooth and lack of XM radio are a disappointment. I owned two Acura TLs, the last being the TL Type S, both fine cars.  However, I wanted a smooth ride, but still with some power.  The GS 350 certainly fills that order.  However, the navi system is inferior in every way to the Acura TL as is the Bluetooth operation. The Acura came with XM for free and if you want to install XM on the GS 350, it is an $850 charge. Despite the negatives, the positives are so many that it makes this car a joy","The appearance, performance, and comfort along with the great sound system.  ","Copy Acura's navi system and, for heaven's sake, allow changes while driving. Also, copy Acura's Bluetooth.  The GS 350's Bluetooth is slow, repetitive and the sound does not come out of the speaker system.  And, pop for XM radio, it should not be an upgrade. If Acura can do it, so should Lexus."

I'm not sure I can shop for another manufacturer once my lease is up.  But I have experienced some minor quality control issues that are annoying.  Within the first 13 months, both side view mirrors gave out and required replacement (occurred at different time), the memory positions for the passenger front seat stopped working (replaced a solenoid), The sunroof wouldn't flip open (replaced a solenoid) and the motorized trunk would not secure (replaced a mechanism within the motor).

Differences were very nice tight sports drive compared to a more luxury ride and long term reliability.

Run flat tires are a mixed blessing: they have peace of mind with better than expected winter performance (experienced a major blizzard in PA with 18 wheelers jackknifing around me), but they are noisy and harder on bumps.

Without a doubt, I made the right choice.  The M35 may be sportier and offer more options technologically, but the Lexus level of refinement is night and day.  I enjoy the clean look of the hidden buttons on the center console-no looking down while driving to try to figure out which one of the fifty buttons to press.
