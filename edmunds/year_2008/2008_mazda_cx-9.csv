When that pump or its seals fail, it dumps the coolant into the oil system destroying the engine and it happens regularly from what I've found between 90K and 110K miles which is out of warranty timeframe and Mazda and Ford do not care enough about the design flaw (which they are aware of but don't warn you about) to financially help with the $10,000 it takes to replace the engine.",,

5,What a CRAZY AMAZING SUV with Zoom Zoom!,Joe ,05/27/2016,5,5,4,,,5,5,5,5,,,"First off, the value of this car is simply amazing! It is no wonder how it received the title of the SUV of the year this year. I smile the second I get in this thing and find reasons to drive it around. Before buying, I research vehicles a ton to find out what to buy and the best value for what I need. Nothing else was even on the radar after reseaching the CX-9 and after test driving one. If you have never driven a Mazda, I don't know if you can understand to zoom zoom theme and the quality of these vehicles. The CX-9 has plenty of power with the 3.7 V6 engine and handles like a much smaller car. The comfort from the leather heated seats is second to none and I have ridden in my fair share of comfy seats. I really don't think you will be disappointed in them at all. The cabin is made up of quality materials all the way around. Soft touch material almost everywhere (not on the dash) and you can tell Mazda thought things through as far as placement is concerned. The navigation system is a bit outdated now (in 2016), but is still functional and considering how fast we all know that technology changes, I think that is a feat in itself. Moving onto the sound system, I challenge someone to find a better sounding system than the Bose system installed in the CX-9. The base and treble is outstanding. I have had several people comment when riding in the vehicle about how good it all sounds. The proximity key system, push button start and power lift gate are great features that unless you have or have had them, you won't really know what you're missing. A standard key and keyless entry would be sufficient, but it is nice to have the options if you can get them. The interior space and sliding middle row is a great feature that makes increasing leg room to the second row or getting passengers into the third row much easier. You will love it or should I say your passengers will love it and thank you for it. Very nice. The storage space in the front for odds and ends is limited in my opinion. I don't have a plethora of things to store, but I found it to be tight and cluttered looking in the center counsel because of the things I had to store in there. Not very deep or wide, but great quality materials and padding are certainly present. The bluetooth phone connectivity is adequate. Displaying the names of callers and making an easier set up/pairing system would be great. It is a little tricky, but I did figure it out after some troubleshooting. Overall, I could not be happier with the purchase. I honestly rate driving it and owning it a 10/10. If you are in the market for a competitively priced crossover SUV with the option to seat 7, look no further than the CX-9. Hope this review helps!",,
1,2008 Mazda CX-9,Michael Reisig ,05/07/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,"Probably the worst vehicle I've ever owned, no ZOOM ZOOM here! After the vehicle hit a 100K, it was all downhill from there. First, a wiring harness holding clip broke causing the harness to shift and rub against the frame. Eventually, the vibration wore the insulation on the wires away (within the harness) making them come in contact with one another. This created a short in the electrical system causing No. 6 coil and fuel injector to go out. Parts and labor repair cost: $1007. Next, at 104K, the master cylinder brake booster went out. Parts and labor repair cost: $585. Third, at 109K, the “internal” water pump went out causing coolant and water to mix with the oil. This resulted in the ruination of the engine. UNBELIEVABLE engineering design! Repair cost for a junkyard motor with installation: $3650. Water pumps go out on vehicles all the time without ruining the engines. It's appalling to think that Mazda would ever use such an inferior  design that would cause such a thing. Finally, I called Mazda USA headquarters to see if I could get some financial assistance with the engine replacement cost but was told since I didn't take it to the dealership to perform the work that I was out of luck.

We are getting about 17.2 mpg with City/highway driving.  The third seat is great for the grandchildren.

Highlander is too expensive with ultra-cheap 3rd row and non-splittable. CX9 is the best deal out there. I was worrying about the reliability like most potential buyers would be.

As a car nut who has owned just about every type of car imaginable including Audi, BMW etc. - this vehicle has exceeded my expectations in every way.  The drivability and sheer practicality of the CX-9 is unmatched.  I looked at every crossover and for anyone who enjoys cars - there simply is no comparison if you need the room of a 3 row CUV/SUV.  I even owned the new Acura MDX and aside from the Acura's vastly superior navigation system, just about everything else on the CX-9 is better.   BTW - I have not had any issues with the 20 inch wheels - the ride is smooth, taut and in no way harsh. The CX-9 simply drives like a nice European vehicle.  Highly recommend it.

Other items that could be improved: (a) multi-level seat heaters (b) ability for driver to have control over all windows - even if they are locked for passengers.

We have taken in the mountains of CO and gone on dirt mt. roads and the FWD was superior to any of my RWD vehicles. This is a roomy fun car to drive and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

The vehicle strikes a wonderful ride comfort/handling balance, providing agility, flat cornering, responsive transmission and steering while not punishing occupants on bad roads.

We purchased the touring over the grand touring based on available features and price.  We have been very pleased with the ride and available features Mazda has put into this vehicle.

We were most surprised though about the difference between the CX-7 & the 9.  The fit and finish of the 9 seemed significantly better than the 7.

The Mazda was just right.  The lack of interior storage is frustrating, with all the room in the center stack wasted under a compartment that barely fits a couple of wallets.

While not quite perfect for our needs, it was clearly the best overall SUV, and came out on top for functionality, ergonomics, and as a bonus, it didn't look like the box that a more attractive vehicle came in. We had only looked at the Mazda as an afterthought, figuring we'd end up with the Highlander, but were very surprised at the overall quality and attention to detail in the CX-9. While the Highlander had arguably better performance and interior storage space, it lacked many things the CX-9 offered, such as a split-row third seat and ample room in all three rows, among others. A very good buy.","The blind-spot monitor is our favorite; while it's not a substitute for careful driving, it helps in congested, multi-lane traffic. The overall handling is impressive for a vehicle this size. And it has a 3rd row seat that can hold adults and has usable space behind the 3rd row seat even when its up.",More in-cabin storage; the center console and the glove box don't hold much. A bit softer ride. More sound- deadening insulation to help quell coarse-pavement roar. A trip computer. Do away with the two-tone leather. Offer more color choices. We bump our heads on the rakish roof line when getting in.
4.625,Best In Its Class,shawn08 ,10/09/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Just purchased the Mazda Cx9 Touring in September.  I have about a 1000 miles on the truck.  I enjoy driving this truck, its way better on gas than the LR3 I had.  The interior of the vehicle is well designed.  I did not get the Grand Touring since cars with nav these days go for less when it's time to trade in or sell.  Got the entertainment center with the upgraded Bose stereo it's amazing!  Not sure what everyone is talking about but my car has a trip odometer maybe they don't know how to find it.  Before I made this purchase I test drove quite a bit of trucks before making my decision.  I am glad I went with the CX9.","Entertainment center, sporty steering wheel, comfortable seating and lots of space",Change thr cheap plastic on the center of the steering wheel on Touring and Grand Touring models.  Nickel finish would be better to match the trims inside the car.  On the Touring model memory for the seats should also be standard.
4.25,Sporty and Fun,Mark ,10/03/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,1,5,"I traded in a VW Beetle, so there isn't much comparison except from the test drives I have been on. We considered a Pathfinder, Pilot and the Highlander. The Pilot was too much like a car and not very responsive.  The Highlander was too pricey for the amount of vehicle. The Pathfinder felt really bulky in comparison to the CX-9. I drive about 4 hours every weekend with my wife and great dane. We wanted a vehicle that would allow us to have room for children in the back along with our dog. The gas mileage isn't too impressive, but a vehicle this size just doesn't have that 30 mpg ability right now. The backup cam on the nav screen seems dangerous.","Blind spot monitoring, I didn't even know it had it, but what a relief it does. Auto-wipers. Halogen headlamps. Blue-tooth capability. Overall value.","I drove a fully decked out 2008 CX-9 with navigation, which quickly deterred me from buying the nav system. Someone needs to tell Mazda that unlike a fine wine, navigation systems do not get better with age. I prefer to use my $150 Garmin over it. Also, the sunroof leaked during a recent car wash."
4.875,Great Value,Icemahn ,09/26/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"Traded our '04 Sienna in for the CX-9. Test drove an Acura MDX '08, GMC Acadia and Yukon Hybrid. CX-9 Power and handling is similar to the MDX while the third row space comparable to the Acadia. It truly provides the best of both worlds without compromising style or comfort. Mazda hit the bullseye with this one!","All-wheel drive, excellent sound system (Bose), Hands-free phone and navigation commands, power lift-gate, sporty handling, great looks (20 inch/10 spoke wheels is awesome!), passenger comfort.","Better nav system interface, auto-lock (at >15mph speed), more power (match Acura's 300 HP)"
4.125,Big switch from German made vehicles,Gary  ,09/26/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,3,3,"After owning 3 VW Passat Wagons (8 total German made autos) we made a decision to go with the CX-9. Enormous price difference and a larger cargo area made the difference. Low price put us in the Grand Touring. Great styling, nice interior appointments. Too early to tell about reliability. Looking forward to use all-wheel drive here in Michigan. ","Blind spot monitoring system, adjustable Xenon headlights, Bose sound system, 20-inch wheels, excellent climate control system.","No trip computer, Gauges on dash difficult to see on bright day, no auto locks, can't stretch out left leg on long drives."

Looks great and it's so much fun to drive! Very roomy inside, comfortably seats at least 5 adults and 2 kids! When everyone in a back entertained by watching DVDs, I kept entertained by Zoom-Zoom! Love it more every day!","Nav system, 6 CD changer, Bluetooth, keyless entry and remote start, automatic liftgate, GameBoy, Blind Spot monitoring, IPod I guess everything!",Would like better mileage per gallon!
4.625,Great Ride for a Big Vehicle,parunner ,09/18/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,We bought this because we needed a family vehicle with more space.  We went from a VW Passat and honestly there is not much difference going to this bigger vehicle.  It drives wonderful.,"The way it drives, smooth and sporty. Handles like a sport car.",Open the back seat up a little and have better access to the 3rd row.  Feels a little cramped compared to the competition.  And also open up the front bumper a bit to match the rest of the impressive styling.
4.75,Sporty Performance in a Roomy Package,KBW ,08/29/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"If your tired of the minivan life but can't figure out how to get that sporty ride you've been longing for without giving up the room of your van then take a look at the CX-9.  For sure it compromises in some aspects like overall storage but much less than most in this category.  Compared to my wife's previous Grand Voyager the level of comfort, styling and performance of the CX-9 more than make up for this.  The ride is sure footed meaning its not going to float down the road but its not so tight as to be uncomfortable.  Gas mileage seems to live up to what Mazda reports.  My wife has averaged 19 mpg with mostly in town driving.  Overall, it's a great sporty value for the buck.      ",Sporty styling and handling are excellent for such a large vehicle;  Overall interior room is better than most in its class; Basic stereo with MP3 hookup is more than adequate; and the two tone leather seating is very supportive and appears to be of nice quality.   ,Storage is limited up front compared to that of most minivans.  Handling is sportier than some might like.  I recommend a lengthy test drive prior to purchasing if you prefer that floating down the road feel.  I recommend getting the fog lights; front end looks lacking without them.
4.625,Incredible Value,MCNC ,08/26/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"Traded in an '05 MDX, and after review & test drive of the new MDX and other ""premium"" CUVs, couldn't believe the value - I suppose maybe a few missing features?  No compromise to the ride and handling, however, and great drivetrain with 6 spd manumatic.  X5, ML, Audi, etc, have nothing on the CX-9 in terms of the way it drives.  Also quiet and comfortable.  Mileage is as advertised, not great, though on a recent trip got 18.5 mpg with car loaded down including rooftop luggage.  Middle row seat is limousine-like.  Only criticism is this is my 2nd Mazda (also a 2007 ""3"") with a vibrating LH mirror - Mazda can't fix them??  One unscheduled repair for a failed rear wheel bearing.","6 spd manumatic which I use in manual mode most of the time.  Handling.  Styling inside and out.  Seat comfort.  2nd row space, comfort.","""Cooled"" seats.  8-way on passenger seat.  More center console storage space.  Cheap looking steering wheel center trim came from parts bin, looks out of place in an otherwise premium vehicle.  I wish Mazda mirrors didn't vibrate!"
4.875,A total surprise!,Aaron ,08/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have been looking for the perfect large SUV to replace our 04 Chevy Venture that was totaled about three weeks ago, and found it in the CX-9. At first look it is sexy but seemingly too small for my family of 6. But I took one for a test drive to my wife, and we fell in love. It was a base sport model and I was still impressed. The interior design is a 10+, handling is great. I pushed the engine out to about 5000 or 6000 rpm before shifting in manual mode and the tranny was still silky smooth. I had to check the readout to be sure that I even shifted gears. All of my kids fit surprisingly well with two boosters and one car seat.  ","Space, interior, exterior design, the tranny, power and features.","Twenty-two inch chrome wheels would have put this thing the class it deserves. Open up the front bumper a little more to complete the aggressive look. Four headrest monitors instead of the overhead style. A little more snap to the engine off the line, and fog lights standard."

Love to drive it and is in the top 4 most powerful engines in or around its class. ","Power, handling, sporty feel and look. Well built with a towing capacity.","Needs more interior trim options and colors, although its still classy"
4.25,Better than any Minivan!,ejhc11 ,08/14/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,5,4,4,5,"I just got this about two weeks ago, still w/ only 560 fun miles on it. I compared to an Audi Q7 3.2 which was out of my budget. The Mazda was better in rear passenger room and ergonomics for 2nd and 3rd row passengers. Power was also better because the Mazda was lighter, mine was a FWD CX-9.  A lot of technical features for the money. Nice sporty alternative for a 7 passenger vehicle than buying a minivan.","Looks nice, not bulky like the GMC Acadia. Same gas mileage as my 03 Toyota Sienna but a lot more power and light years in handling, braking and fun to drive factor. Really a ""Zoom Zoom""","Cannot figure out if the power door locks will auto lock after putting vehicle in gear or driving off. A feature I have in both my 2003 cars. Right now I have to manually push the power door locks to lock or unlock in the vehicle. Also,auto headlamps come on early and can only be adjusted by dealer?"
4.625,What gas mileage do you expect?,Brian ,07/18/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,3,5,"This car is so fun to drive. The interior is comfortable and versatile, the engine and transmission are silky smooth, the climate control, seat configuration, styling, and Bose stereo are awesome. I get 19-20 mpg in mixed driving and don't understand why this large 7-person vehicle continually gets knocked on gas mileage. Sure, if you take off from every stop like a jackrabbit, you'll get 15mpg, but c'mon. I hate cars, and I hated the minivan I replaced with the CX-9, but I love driving this one.","Bose stereo, powerful engine, handling, versatile and comfortable seating, climate control, low maintenance intervals.","Rear visibility, quality of buttons and controls, strange Mazda feature packages, climate control must be on to affect interior temperature."
4.75,A vehicle you will not regret buying,jenon ,07/17/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,This is an awesome vehicle traded in my ML320 for it and never regretted. Best of all it uses regular gasoline.

4.875,Love my Mazda,MASSBEAN ,07/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is my first Mazda and we love it.  Went to auto shows and read many reviews before deciding. Drove the Edge and several others but nothing beat the driving and handling. It is so fun to drive.  I traded in a lg SUV and I love the difference - I feel like I'm in a sports car. The room is great, love the dashboard display and the Bose/sunroof.  My only 2 complaints are that it could be better on gas and there is no trip odometer.  I traded a 5.4 Expedition and I'm only getting 4-5 mpg better.  Mazda could work on that, otherwise no complaints so far","The handling is great, love the stereo and the MP3 capability.

4.75,A driver's SUV,SwissDog ,07/13/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I have been driving a Mazda 3 5-door for the past 4 years. That vehicle drove great and had amazing feel in the wheel-just as good as my wife's 2002 325i. Getting behind the wheel of the CX9 was seamless... no difference in feel. There is definitely more mass but that's what you get for a big vehicle.,"Backup camera in mirror. Quiet cabin. Bose. Rear seat access & adjustability. Interior ""mood"" lighting. Comfy front seats. Simple controls.",Direct injection V6 should help fuel economy.
3.25,"Over-rated, Highlander better choice",BDW ,07/12/2008,,,2,3,4,4,,4,3,2,4,The transmission noise/uncertainty and lurching is a continuing source of annoyance.  The visibility is just fair at best.  The fuel economy isn't close to 'EPA estimates' and it's hard to get in and out w/o banging my head on the too low entry/roof.  My favorite passenger isn't happy about ride comfort either.  A very over-rated vehicle.  ,Handling and engine performance are good. ,Ergonomics need major work - visibility and low roof line are major faults.  EPA fuel mileage estimate must have been hyped by a granny driving it below the speed limits.   Transmission searching for the right gear is like a random walk; downshifts are NOT seamless! 
4.875,Great vehicle few design flaws,jzwix ,06/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Fun to drive and ride is perfect.  A slam-dunk upgrade from our minivan.

","Comfort, drive, great looks, headlights, dash lights, Bose, bluetooth, third row seating, storage, reclining second row seats, backup camera and blind spot monitoring system.",Better plastic trim that doesn't scuff easily and a digital display which isn't crowded and duplicates the navigation screen information.

I like the back-up camera on the mirror. ,Lousy fuel mileage. Would like it to have an adjusting gas pedal. Front needs more storage areas.

It is an old disk and they will not send us a new one -- don't have one.  They advertised the ability to add an iPod jack, so you could control it from the radio, when we got it.  They have finally withdrawn the offer. Unfortunately, we complained because that add on is one we really wanted.  I love my Mazda for driving, but the extras that make it a great car is the company.  The company is lousy.

We were just walking away from our Toyota minivan, we were looking for a car-like comfort, but more performance and fun, and Mazda made our shortlist. Excellent features and price, well loaded, and a great ride sold us.  After 6 months we very happy with the car, but the mileage needs major improvement!

Purchased Touring AWD on 1/11/08, and have about 5500 miles on it.  Smoothest and quietest ride ever, great stereo, a real joy.  Makes my wife's Camry XLE seem awfully loud and rough riding in comparison.  Only drawbacks... avg about 16-17 mpg in town, and 18-20 on highway.  With a 20 gal tank range is nothing more than 350 miles.  Only needs reg gas though so some savings here. But no trip computer.  Overall, I would buy again... a real joy to drive.  Not a single issue in the 4 months and 5k miles, just an oil change. Enjoy the drive.","Smooth and quiet ride, Bose stereo, and outstanding fit and finish. Sharp styling.

Before I bought the CX9, I had compared it with the Ford Edge, Acura RDX, Acura MDX, and even the Mazda CX7.  In the end, the CX9 was a no- brainer.  The exterior styling looks aggressive.  The interior styling is gorgeous.  The CX9 has virtually all of the same features as the Acura MDX, but for $1000's less.

I was very impressed how much rear legroom it had and the 3-zone climate control.  Then I drove it, and the first thing I noticed was how much quieter it was than the CX-7 and how smooth the enigine and transmission were.  It also doesn't feel like you're driving a large SUV.  My dogs fit in the back with room to spare.  I went from a Celica to this, so cornering, parking and gas consumption are much different, but I knew that it would be.","Engine/transmission is sooo smooth. Bose stereo.

With the MDX you've got about two choices and you get everything. Some models have the side warning thing, some don't; depends on when during the year it was built. If you want a sun roof you can't have the entertainment pckg. and so on.

I had been driving a Dodge Durango and loved it.  My husband did not want a smaller vehicle so we drove the CX9.  I really like the looks of the CX9.  My only complaint is that I settled for the black interior which I know will be very hot in the summer.   ,"I love the Bose stereo, the lumbar support in seat and really have enjoyed the seat warmer.",I would like to have fog lights.

Traded in a Mazda Tribute for the CX-9 to gain some more space.  The CX-9 is a very quiet ride and excellent for getting our toddler in and out of the back seat.  This vehicle is clearly meeting our needs as a young family and we plan to keep this vehicle for a long time.

I dont care for the way the Acuras or Toyotas look. So for me it was between the VW, Mazda CX-9 and Audi.  The Mazda was in there because I have all car magazines coming to the house and I had read that the Mazda was truly something. And it looks incredible.

I've always driven nothing but European sports cars, but am VERY impressed with this car.  Steering is excellent for any vehicle.  Handling is good for a car this big, but Mazda really needs to address the torque steer under hard acceleration in FWD models.   It isn't fast, but quick enough for what it is. The interior is tasteful and well done.  A few cheap plastic bits, but what do you expect at this price?  This car looks and performs like a $45K car, and can be had nicely optioned for $35K.    A steal at this price, it drives as well as some competitors costing $20K more. Perfect as kid carrier or a sporty SUV- - can do both well.

The CX-9 is a very spacious, practical vehicle, and it is about as close to driving a sport sedan as a CUV can get. The Grand Touring 20"" wheels do ride slighly stiffer than the 18"" wheels on the Touring, but I don't find it objectionable.

Since we have owned 2 previous Mazdas (I currently own the MZ3S) we were very excited about the CX-9.  The CX-7 was nice but too small for our needs.  This CX-9 fit our needs perfectly.  Although a fairly large vehicle at about 200"" long and almost 5,0000 lbs, it drives like a sporty sedan on steroids.  Acceleration is brisk and the ride is fairly smooth.

Truth be told, in test driving the Toyota Highlander, Lexus RX 330, Honda Pilot and GMC Acadia, the CX-9 had them all beat.  The ride was incredible.  Power when I needed it and agility when necessary are the atrributes that made the CX-9 stand above the rest in this category.  While the review is true about the stiffness with the 20"" wheels, it's not as bad as the review potentially paints it.

It looks like it should, luxury crossover.  HID lights very cool, transmission - smooth, precise, ready to rev.  For such a heavy ride (all in the category are heavy), it is a blast to drive.","Get that gas mileage up!  16.2?  On the second tank, driving it easy.  I am sure it will loosen up and of course be better on the highway."
5,Awesome SUV,SC Bill ,10/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We looked at Pilot, Highlander, Volvo C-90, Lexus and others.  CX-9 Grand Touring, in my opinion, blew them away.  Only have 200 miles on it, so there is still much to learn.  It was immediately comfortable and familiar to drive.  Very car-like,  ""zoom-zoom philosophy"" is very evident. It is easy and fun to drive, and size is not apparent until it is time to park it, or wash it!  Dashboard at night, for gadget-freaks, is like piloting the space shuttle.  Nav is to a large degree voice activated, some dealers didn't seem to understand that.  I currently own a 6 sp Acura CL- S and find every excuse I can to borrow my wife's CX-9. Do yourself a favor - test drive it!! ","Very easy to drive, comfortable ride.  Versatility of seating configurations and legroom in second row.  Exterior design minimizes size of vehicle.","Radio and cruise control buttons on steering wheel are slightly too high and can accidently be hit.  A styling tradeoff, but I wonder how it will fair for door dings without body side molding"
4.875,Excellent value and fun to drive!!!,newtozoom ,10/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I looked at the Audi Q7, Subaru Tribeca, Acura MDX, Honda Pilot, & CX9.  The CX9 offered the most value and room compared to the others.  My wife loved the look.  I liked the Bluetooth phone features, navigation system, memory seats, keyless entry & start system, and the list goes on.  This is my first Mazda.  After doing my research, the CX9 offered an all around excellent package.  It has the space for my family of 5 and is fun to drive; unlike my previous car (Toyota Sienna).  If you want a roomy, fun to drive, and aggressively designed SUV the Mazda CX9 is worth a test drive.","Bluetooth, voice activated navigation system, memory seats, backup camera, MP3 6 disc CD player, DVD player with wireless headphones, power open/close rear liftgate, keyless entry & start system, 6-speed sport AT automatic transmission.",Auto door lock when putting the car in drive and auto unlock when having the car in park.  Audible rear and front bumper sensors.
4.75,Great Car,petera ,10/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"We bought this car to replace a Honda Accord which we were sorry to see go but needed AWD.  To cut a long story short we tried a number of cars we tried a number of 'smaller' crossovers including a CX-7, and then my wife sat in a CX-9 they had on the lot.  1 hour later we owned it.  It was just head and shoulders over anything else we had looked at in terms of quality, performance and out and out 'coolness'.  Interior is stunning, well thought out and comfortable.  Leg room is generous as is room for cargo.  Car is easy to drive and feels a lot smaller than it really is.  While it won't break any records on the 1/4 mile it is plenty powerful enough for most situations.","Nav system, fit and finish and general comfort (my family is all over 6 ft and there plenty of space for knees in the second row).  I would STRONGLY recommend getting the backing camera.  The rear window is high and there is a big blind spot.","Fuel useage is a bit of a shock, but one must remember a) the weight of the car is around 2 tons and b) the engine size.  Complexity of some controls, especially those controlled by center touch screen needs some serious time in the manual."
4.875,True Crossover,EtoileBrilliant ,10/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Much better looking than in the pictures. I got Sand on Black. Current car couldn't get three child seats across the back. Moreover, with 7 month old, wanted option to have adult in second row to administer bottle.  Wife didn't want SUV, I didn't want minivan - perfect compromise. Whilst not quite BMW interior, its probably up there with Passat top of the line, with Passat pricing.  Parked next to Q7 in city garage, could barely distinguish the two side-by-side.","Bluetooth, night lighting on gauges, third row seat simplicity, wood trim is dark enough not to look cheap.",True key less start to allow key less entry.
5,Great SUV for familes,Ken Miller ,10/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Mazda CX-9 is a much better vehicle than the 2007 Honda Pilot I traded in.  There is less road noise, better steering, better stereo, more power and torque.  It seems like it should have cost more for all of the features, how it handles and drives compared to the Pilot.  The six-speed automatic does not downshift all the time like the Honda's five speed did and shifts perfectly unlike the GM six speeds in their new SUVs which I also looked at.   Rear seat is easy to get into and seats are much better than the Pilot.",,
4.75,Love this car,Go Revs! ,10/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Edmunds review is spot-on. I bought the GT AWD with Assistance Package (nav+), the rear entertainment system, and towing package.  Interior storage up front and cup holders are a little lacking, the rear doors open wide (pro/con), and the wheels communicate a lot of road imperfections. That said, I love my cx-9. Fun to drive; interior feels very upscale; looks great inside and out. From the outside, you'd never guess the interior space -- seats slide and layout is great. It is huge inside, other than height (though there is plenty of headroom). Got the towing package to use a cargo carrier for keeping trash barrels outside on trips to the dump (this vehicle replaces my pickup).",1) Technology! Smart card key (how did we live before this?); Bluetooth is easy to use - anybody holding their phone to their ear is crazy; nav; back up camera; rain sensing wipers; touch screen audio controls; auto close rear gate. 2) Fun to drive 3) Great looks.,"Front storage/cup holders. Unless I haven't figured out the settings, when you turn the headlights on, the nav goes to black background. Doesn't work well for daytime situations where you have headlights on. Mileage or size of gas tank. Better mileage than my p/u, but seems I'm always filling."
5,"""Zoom, Zoom, Zoom!  What a feeling!""",FM ,10/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Compared this car with the 08 Highlander.  We decided on the 08 Mazda CX-9 because of the standard safety features, great quality interior and the very sturdy feel when driving.  Plenty of room with standard 7 passenger seating, standard 2nd row air vents, as opposed to the Highlander's optional 7 passenger seating and optional 2nd row air vents.  The Bose sound system is a plus!  Great exterior design.  My children loves the roomy space and the DVD Entertainment. We have discovered the ""zoom, zoom, zoom"" way of driving and what a feeling, indeed!  We recommend this vehicle to anyone shopping for the best of the best!  Safety, quality, comfort the zoom, zoom way!  The price is just right","Easy fold third-row seats for additional cargo space, hidden cargo floor, easy third-row seat access.  Bose sound system. Fine quality leather seats!","Power lift gates should be standard in all trim but not a big problem.  It is still easy access for children loading school instruments, backpacks, etc."
4.875,A hidden gem,CTCXer ,10/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Like others, I looked at the Toyota Highlander, Acura MDX, Lexus GX470, Saturn Outlook, and Subaru Tribeca before selecting the CX-9. The exterior styling is fantastic with the stylish lines and those 20"" rims. The interior is well laid out and feels like it was designed by people that actually cared about what it would be like to ride in every day. Controls are intuitive which is a nice change from our BMW X5 and Infiniti FX. The Bose stereo also beats the Harmon-Kardon in the bimmer by miles!! The bluetooth took 3 minutes to setup and worked with both mine and my wife's phones. Smooth to drive, plenty of pep, and comfortable.","Touchscreen navigation, bluetooth, and spacious third row.","True satellite ready tuner (without an extra $500 for satellite radio), ability to have aux input available with satellite radio, and a proper iPod integration (the one they sell doesn't work if you have the nav system!)."
4.75,New but have a good feelin about it...,researched4months ,10/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"We are still under 1k miles so I haven't let loose on it however, I can tell it is going to be fun once I do.  30-70 mph acceleration is fantastic.   We shopped for months for the perfect car and we feel we got it with the CX-9.  Did we need the back up cam and navigation system?  Not really, but we really wanted the Blue and it was the only one available.   There is plenty of room for us and our new baby.  The only downside for me is that the seats are a bit narrow in the front, however, I am 6'4"" 290 lbs.  This is the first vehicle I don't have to put the seat ALL the way back!","Bose sound system (worth every penny), sports car like handling, easy to fold seating.",Electronic folding mirrors.
4.875,Best of the Best,Heads Turner ,09/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"I considered Audi Q7, Acura MDX, 2008 Toyota Highlander, GMC Acadia, etc., but no one can come close to this vehicle in terms of performance, quality and price. This car is 100% built in Japan and proves to be the best of the best available today. This car is a true head turner. After my research for three months I bought a 2008 black on black CX9 GT AWD with Bose and moonroof.  Drive it once and you will realize what you have been missing.","Bose is awesome, everything else is just perfect.",
4.875,Mazda CX-9,storyjbj ,09/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Car drives fast, smooth with a calm fun to it.","The new body style that you are beginning to see out there on the road, but no one really has them yet.","Digital radio display showing what radio station, artist and song playing. Prior car had this."
4.875,Zoom-Zoom?,shailesh ,09/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought this vehicle brand new from the dealership. The sales rep was extremely knowledgable about this vehicle. I added a remote starter, all weather mats, Lojack and rear cargo mat. The cargo cover cannot be installed due to remote closing gate. Mazda has done a superb job of putting this vehicle together, extensive list of accessories and safety features are standard in this particular model.The car is riding very well (only 200 miles so far!), sound system is unbelievable. The steering response for a crossover suv is excellent. The engine noise and the cabin noise is barely noticeable. Acceleration with the 273 hp engine is more then adequate. So far no complaints.","Sound system, steering response and cabin noise. The techno package is unbelievable.",None so far.
4.875,"Awesome, almost perfect family vehicle!!",wilsonclan ,09/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Picked it up last week. Waited specifically for the 08 and the 3.7 engine, worth the wait for sure. Power really comes on strong now for passing. Perfect blend of utility and performance, blast to drive. Comfort has been excellent so far, no complaints from rear seat passengers, plenty of room all around. Most of the upscale features one would expect for the money. Fit and finish exceptional. More quiet than the Infiniti we just turned back in from lease. Where we live there haven't been many running around on the roads yet, which doesn't bother me at all, who wants to see what you're driving on every corner. Adds a level of exclusivity!","Smart Key (nice). Middle row seats adjustable fore and aft and recline, access to the 3rd row is easy. Remote start. Bluetooth works well. Drives like a sports sedan, not an SUV or van. Nice interior design and materials, uplevel feel. Voice command nav, if we can train it to function properly.","Bose sound system is the real weak link for me. It is average at best, and we have the 11 speaker unit. With the nav unit, you can't use the 30 pin iPod connector, and with Sirius you have to pay extra for the splitter that allows you to use the aux jack. Should have a trip computer for this price. "
5,The CX-9 is a Great Ride,LuvmyCX9 ,09/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought my CX-9 this week.  Did extensive search looking at the Acura MDX, Toyota Highlander, Volvo XC90, Honda Odyssey, Honda Pilot, Toyota Sienna. Reasons I picked the CX-9: 1) Good access to third row.  Second row seats can slide forward, so you can access the third row without having to move a car seat. 2) Comparable to 2008 Accura MDX in features but costs a lot less, MDX more difficult to get to the third row and dash is very cluttered with different knobs.  3) Comparable to the 2008 Highlander but a better ride.  Highlander still has a trucky feel. 4) Decided against the minivans because the new cross-over SUVs offer comparable features and space, without the minivan ride.","Navigation, Bluetooth, stereo, engine performance and pickup (probably benefited a little from the bigger engine in the 2008), quiet inside (even with the 20s), very plush and comfortable interior and exterior.","Child locks. Still trying to figure out the navigation, but I'm sure I'll learn, Would be nice if seat memory settings also adjusted left and right side mirrors.  Comparable gas mileage with other SUVs and minivans, but would like to see improvement."
4.75,Excellent overall,mazdacx9zoom ,08/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I have been shopping for family car for a long time. I test drove many cars such as Honda Pilot, Odyessy, Toyota Highlander, Toyota Sienna, GMC Acadia, and Hyundai Veracruz. I was going to get Honda Odyessy since it is very affordable and looks good, but I did not like how it drove. However, after I drove Mazda CX9, it was love at first sight. I love how it drives. Exterior and interior looks great. They did great design overall. Ride is firm and roomy for 7 adults.   ","I love how it drives. Mazda's slogan was true (""zoom-zoom""). This car is combined Lexus and Acura TL.","My only compliant is the MPG. I think it is getting around less than 18 combined highway and local driving. And also I have sport model and when I drive freeway, my wife was complaining that she is bounced all over. I wish it was little softer.  Also, I think they can do better design on front."
5,Most fun Crossover to drive,Bobzilla ,08/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I test drive the Saturn Outlook, the new 2008 Highlander, Honda Pilot and the 2007 Acura MDX. The CX-9 was more fun to drive than all of them and still gave me a real  third row seat. I took my 22 year old son with me and we both tried getting in and out of the back seats in all of them and the Mazda was the easiest. I found this the ideal car for taking my road bike to the club starting point and hauling 7 family members to dinner and the most fun to drive of all the cars.  Economy seems the same as my 1997 Camry V6 so far on the first two tanks.","Handling, third row seat, easy folding seats, bluetooth, mp3 connector. In floor storage in  back rear.","Would have liked a radio that displayed song information, and a pause control on CD playing."
