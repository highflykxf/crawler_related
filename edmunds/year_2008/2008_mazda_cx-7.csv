1,"Surprise, Surprise!!!",Causality of a Bad Design ,10/18/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bought 2008 CX-7 in '08 with no miles. Had no issues until June 2014 after driving the car 2.5 miles and the car started to overheat. I parked the car and took it to the dealer the next day. Diagnosis, the engine needed to relaced. Never had a check engine light warning or any other indicator for that matter. It is now October 2015, a refurbished engine and new  turbo later, the car still does't work.  The car has been operational maybe 4 months in this timeframe. A car salesman who was a friend  told me to trade it in after paying on it for 3 years back in '11 because he said these engines were bad. I wish I had listened. Mazda should be ashamed of themselves. This model's engine was a lemon.",,
3,Let me tell you!!,lykeisha ,09/14/2014,,,1,4,4,2,,3,4,1,5,I got this car with 18k miles on it and I initially loved it despite the premium gas and the gas mileage it was great.  We took it on family trips from Ohio to Florida on 3 occasions.  60k noticed an oil leak-engine ouil cooler was defective-not covered under warranty but Mazda was aware that this was a known issue and was doing nothing about it.  Cost-$600+.  White smoke out the exhaust-Vent kit needed-known issue not covered.  Cost-$700+.  At now 98k all of a sudden rattling took it in low on oil by 4 quarts?? No oil light came on or service light came on?? A week later guess what same thing..and the engine is blown!  Talk about Angry... I still owe on it and I am just going to junk it.,"Body, turbo, torque, and the driver seat adjustment!",I had contacted Mazada when the engine oil cooler went out because the mazda dealer I got my car from said this is a known problem and they were not going to be making this model anymore because of all the issues.  I asked if they were going to take some kind of responsibilty-  Answer was-No!  Even though I was still under warranty.  Mazada needs to take responsibility by fixing the problem of charge or offering trade-in for another mazada and taking car of the remainder of the car loans people took out in an effort to buy this vehicle.  The interior was always horrible from the ceiling to the carpet!  Tires were too expensive.  Pretty much done at 60k.
4.25,Turbo gone!!!!,nichele ,08/01/2013,,,4,5,5,3,,4,4,4,5,"I bought my 2008 CX7 with almost 5k miles. I really enjoyed driving it....until the timing chain had to be replaced at at 40000 miles, which I thought was a little soon but it was covered.About a year ago, I had to have the engine mount replaced, some bearings were worn and there was an oil leak. That was not covered over $1000 worth of repairs. The CEL came on over the weekend. Took it to the dealer ,turbo engine done....timing chain again, The car needs almost 9000 dollars worth of repairs..are you kidding me!!!The service rep told me that I did good for having 95k miles on the car without anyhing major happening before now.Going to get rid of this car!!!",,
1,Engine Failure CX7 @ 70K miles,ruby23 ,05/02/2013,,,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,"We bought a Certified CX7 2008. A year and a half later the car is completely giving out. We take MAJOR care of all our cars with Synthetic Oil, so when they told us it was due to ""Sludge"" it was definitely a slap in the face. The engine needs to be replaced at only 70k miles. We talked to a mechanic and he told us that the turbo overhearts the engine turning everything into sludge and even melting it. Although we have a platinum coverage, the insurance is doing everything they can to blame it on us. I've been looking at reviews and it seems ALOT of you are having or had the same issues! It's horrible to keep paying for a car whose engine dies of its own malfunction. Its time Mazda owns up!",None anymore!,"Improve your engines and remove the turbo, its over heating causing malfunctions and melting. "
3.125,Engine Failure,mazdasrjunk ,04/05/2013,,,4,4,3,1,,3,3,3,4,"We bought a 2008 CX 7 with 62,000 miles on it in April 2012 they replaced the vvt adjuster and chain at that point. It is now March 2013 and 14,000 miles later and the vvt is out again, the turbo is out and after a $3000 quote to repair it my dealer calls back and says ""well we made the repairs to your car but it is going to need an engine"".That is supposed to cost $6,000. No helpis being brought from Mazda the issue is being pushed to higher up in the world of Mazda.Needless to say Mazda has not impressed me.They are telling me this is caused by ""sludge"".But in the next breath my dealer tells me ""sludge"" is normal in this engine. I wonder how this will play out. ",,"Fix your engines so they last longer than 76,000 miles before needing replacement."
1,Mazda Builds CRAP!!!!!! Buyer Beware,jimjaq1 ,03/20/2013,,,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,"Mazda's design engineers have the heads in a very dark hole. The turbo charger they put in the vehicle does not lubricate itself and fails quickly. At 70K the timing belt has stretched and failed causing a complete rebuild of the engine (BTW, Mazda won't cover any of that, wait until you get to deal with their warranty people). Mazda has design a vehicle that is very noisy inside, bad visibility from anywhere inside the car, terrible air-conditioning, the car rides like a stage coach, and worst of all Mazda does not back its warranties and hides from its responsibilities concerning its products....buyer beware","There are NO redeeming features in this vehicle. Please buy a Toyota, or a Ford, but DO NOT invest your good money on a Mazda product, it would be throwing you money down a rat-hole","The company should make bottle caps, it appears that's the extent of their mechanical and electrical prowess. PLEASE heed this review, you'll regret your decision, it's only a matter of miles."
5,Love my baby!!,loveliladi ,01/09/2013,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased a 2008 CX7 in Oct 2012. 3 days after purchasing it I too had white smoke coming from the exhaust. I returned it to the dealership and they fixed it with no questions asked. Other than that, like everyone else, the gas consumption is a little low but it also depends on how you drive. If your always driving like a bat out of hell then of course your gas consumption will be less than someone takes their time or goes a slow, steady speed. The interion is comfortable (sometimes I feel like Im in a cockpit in a spaceship lol). The back is very roomy and everyone says they love it back there. This is my first SUV so I ma love, love, loving sitting higher. Great purchase so far. ",,
4,Fun car to drive but too many issues.,colgezgini ,01/05/2013,,,5,5,1,3,,5,4,4,5,"I will edit this review with details; in a nut shell, it is very fun to drive, good steering and suspension response on all kind of roads. It is agile and has road holding that is better than all of its rivals.Its brakes are also impressive and despite they are little difficult to dose, stopping distance is beautiful.I am 6'7"" and I fit inside comfortably.Actually, I have a friend who owns an BMW X6 and a 2010 CX-7 and he likes dynamics of CX-7 more than X6. His words are ""CX-7 is like extension of my body, obeys all my orders perfectly"".",,"Now the complaints:

1- Terrible consumption. I like playing with my toy a lot, so if push turbo, my mileage goes as low as 15 mpg. Highway driving, I average 21 mpg if I drive around <80mpg

2- Material selection for interior is also terrible. Shiny plastic is easy to scratch and steering wheel leather is completely torn in less than 5 years. Color of plastic components on the cars is also faded. I also had a white smoke coming from my car but the dealer replaced the components after little fight. I understand that is was a design error."
4.625,"Owned for years, still love it",lurking444 ,11/09/2012,,,5,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"I purchased a 2008 CX-7 new, in 2009. It was a ""demo"" model so I got a good deal. My car only has 25,000 miles on it so far (yeah, I don't drive it all the time). However, I do love the sporty feel, the moderately large cargo capacity, and the styling; it still looks cutting edge.I don't drive it much because my wife and I also own a diesel VW Jetta, which gets better than twice the mpg of the Mazda. I've averaged about 18.5mpg on the CX-7 in the years I've owned it. I love the sportiness of the vehicle, but you'll have to make a judgement about whether poor fuel economy is worth the love of the road/drive. I'm happy with my decision to buy this car.","The turbo engine has got plenty of kick when it 'spools' up.
The auto-manual transmission (I have the Grand Touring edition) is great.
The leather seats are comfy and still look stylish.
I like the Xenon headlamps (again on the Grand Touring).
The exterior styling, especially in my Black Cherry color, is striking.
The AWD gets me where I need to go, even in 2 feet of snow (I tested it, more than once).","MPG, MPG, MPG. How many times can I say it? A compact SUV should average better than my observed 18.5 mpg average. My minimum for my next car is 20 mpg average.

The alignment (wheel alignment) is easy to 'knock off'. My alignment destroyed my tires in only 20k miles.

The Mazda installed GPS is poorly designed; my wife's iPhone is more reliable and accurate, with a better interface."

4.75,Great car with a few quirks,dementedcx ,05/26/2012,,,5,5,3,5,,5,5,5,5,"We bought this car a little over a month ago, Traded a 2008 Scion TC for it cause our little family had grown by 1 more. Aside from the MPG's I have no real complaints about it. The brakes needed changed at less than 30K but i undertook that task myself & it has a slight vibration at 50-60mph that i'm still trying to track down. But it's an amazing car to own, it's fast & sporty. The older kids (6&8) absolutely love it, Just wish i had gotten one with more options.","AWD, Turbo, Remote/one touch windows.",

Auto-stick transmission with 6 speed great for driving in snow.

Heavier body and frame than previous car (Subaru Forester S).
Better driving and overall traction in snow. Nice highway car.

Tire-pressure monitoring system really works well.","Factory tires (Goodyear 18"" RSAs) were garbage.

5,Great SUV,jaron1 ,11/13/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is a great car considered lots of other vehicles before buying. I thought the some of these reviews were unfair about this car as most of the problems were due to driver error.

3.5,Big Disapointment,lilgreenfrog76 ,07/19/2011,,,4,5,1,1,,5,5,2,5,"I thought driving a Mazda would be wonderful. I love forgeign cars as they last forever!! I couldn't be more wrong. Bought the car with 16k miles and at 70k miles, the engine blows. First was thought the timing chain broke, but wasn't. Mazda will NOT stand by their product. They have a crappy warrenty for a reason. Their cars are CRAP!! I checked out more cars like mine, there IS a bad problem with the engines!!! There is NO reason for a maintained car to have such issues at low miles. I had a VW with 144k miles, 10 years old and never once gave me problems. SHAME ON YOU MAZDA!! Build a better car or fix it. Check reviews and engine problems on the 07' & 08' CX-7's!!U have been WARNED!!!!","Design and comfort. But that is not what makes the car run. I would rather have a car I can DRIVE.

Less than 3 months after purchasing it brand new, the exhaust tips began rusting.  That was the first bad sign.  Since then in just over 2 years, I've had a door replaced after rusting, trailer hitch has rusted, tires lasted a whole 18,000 miles, I need new brakes and rotors already, and the EGR valve has gone bad and needs replacement ($900 repair).

I had never even considered a Mazda before but I did about 4 days of crash research on everything Mazda I could find on the Net and test drove 3 different CX-7's before I made the purchase. After a week and a half of ownership I am in love with it.  The drive, performance and look are second to none and I got a GREAT DEAL on it.

This is very disappointing I went to the dealership and they don't want any part of this they direct you to Bridgestone even worse, its wear and tear and that is b%$%^%^%. I have bought and leased may other cars never had this problem. Yes it has 18' wheels but choose a better class tire ""BRIDGESTONE TURANZA"" is a low class tire and they know it.

However, if you are considering this car think about these few things:  MPG - it gets at best 20 for me on highway and 17 combined on top of the fact that it needs premium fuel.

Strange blind spot on right side of car. Could be due to me only being 5'6. But would not trade this car for anything.
4.25,Sporty SUV,Mid life crisis ,03/20/2008,,,4,5,4,3,,5,5,3,5,"Touring AWD purchased 2/29/08. This copper red/sand leather sports wagon replaced my 2005 Tribute. Came with Sirius, 6 CD changer, fogs, wheel locks. The standard speakers are above average for a non-upgraded factory sound.  The drive reminds me of my old Eagle Talon, turbo 4 AWD. The suspension is a bit firm, but for that it corners on rails. Nice steering wheel and tight steering feel. Other than the feeling of the vehicle size, a very sporting ride.  My three kids (13,12,9) find the rear seat wider and with more leg room than the Trib. The leather seats are quite comfy and supportive, worth the upgrade.","Sports car drive feel, very good acceleration despite slight turbo lag, better for passing than off the line.  Seating comfort and driver position. Cool red dash lighting. Good control ergos. Above average stock radio. Best looking crossover design and ride.","Interior storage/cupholders lass than average for class. Could use a tad more sound proofing, a bit much on the engine whine. Agree about taller sixth gear for highway. IPod jack. Available full size spare. Belt line moulding, this beauty will get a lot of door dings unless I park her far away."

It drives and handles just like my Beemer did, minus the AWD.  But here in KY, there is no need for AWD 99% of the time.  I've gotten a lot of compliments on this, and there's not a lot of them around since the closest Mazda dealer is an hour away.  I was worried about giving up a 6-cylinder for a 4-banger, but with the Turbo, it's even better than a 6-cylinder.

The Mazda is extremely attractive inside and out, and almost every area of its performance is at or near the top when comparing crossovers.  Almost every GT stocked by Mazda dealerships comes with a Tech Pkg, which includes the nav system, sunroof, Bose/6CD changer, and rear camera.","Outstanding handling; excellent brakes; ergonomics right on;  top of class in acceleration; manual mode on auto trans.--great for off ramps--you use the brakes much less.  Bose 9 spkr Centerpoint sound system fills the interior; seats were very comfortable on 1,600 mile trip; many storage areas    ","Slightly higher 6th gear: 2,700 rpm at 75 mph is too high for extended interstate driving.  As gas starts its march to $4.00, the increased economy from a taller 6th gear, and the need to burn regular gas become more important.  Nitpicks: Drivers memory seat, lighted vanity mirrors.  Not much! "
4.875,Too fun for an SUV,John B. ,03/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased the CX-7 Grand Touring AWD with the technology package. This is a blast of a car to drive - great acceleration and handling (I haven't been able to feel any turbo hesitation). The interior is flawless - everything works as billed. The voice navigation works great and the sound system is terrific. Only drawback - no bluetooth capability. The seating is comfortable (both my wife and I are above 6 ft tall). The keyless entry removes a ton of hassles. The cargo area with the rear seats down is more than adequate for what life with 4 active children throws at us. All in all, a SUV with the soul of a sports car.

The turbo comes in handy when needed.","Turbo power, handling, looks inside-and-outside, dashboard, six gears, manual & automatic shifting, automatic lights, back-up camera, navigation, bose speakers, black cherry mica color, leather seats design.","Fuel economy not so good (at least so far), better turning radius, vanity lights in visor-mirrors and a homelink auto-dimming mirror should be included in a Grand Touring AWD model as a standard option (hard to believe they aren't), less plastic and more wood finish in the interior design."

4.625,Obsidian Pearl,mcspoo ,02/17/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Sleek. Fast. Comfortable. I got a great price on this. CX-7 was not a vehicle I was looking for, but stumbled upon. It drives so smooth I end up over 80mph before I know it. At least, smoother than the Jeep Liberty I traded in for this. You cannot believe how much power the engine has until your drive it. Interior functionality is much better than the Liberty. Wish it had a better stereo (4 speakers, distorts when loud). Still waiting to see the real gas mileage. Massive dashboard and front window takes some getting used to.","The engine has serious pickup. It looks fabulous, and makes a Ford Edge look like a brick. Very comfortable interior.

4.625,Just bought it two days ago,Myshkin ,02/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"We just picked up our CX-7 a couple of days ago. For the last couple of years I have been looking at the Mazda 6, but after driving the CX-7 I was smitten.  If you are considering this vehicle, I would skip the tech package. You can get after-market GPS for a fraction of the price, and in a few years when current tech is outdated you can easily upgrade. Not so if your GPS is built it. The Bose stereo is nice enough though.  Only GT feature I might have liked would be the cool blue lighting and the auto-climate control, but neither were deal-breakers for me.","Leather seats, Bose stereo, Liquid Platinum color, turbo-charged engine, sporty feel in a large vehicle.","Gas mileage of course, and prices on some options are ridiculous. We bought the Touring because all of the GT models that had the colors we liked had navigation... I can buy a Garmin Nuvi 660 for under $400 and that will give me Bluetooth as well."

The 18"" rims are sweet. Wish they were chrome. Seat comfort is good, but I wish they were a little more grippy to go along with the solid handling. I can't say enough about the handling. It is on rails! period. The visibility is excellent, do not need rear view camera. I have garmin nav. much better than optional system. Tons of room up front which is all I care about, feels much roomier than EDGE. Although, premium fuel is recommended instead of required, I don't mind putting 93 octane in it, I feel the power difference between regular.","My favorite feature is definitely the handling and power of this vehicle. It is so far ahead of the Ford Edge it is like nite and day. Mazda engineers must of been giddy when they drove the edge back to back with the CX-7, I was. Edge looks like a brick and drives like one. CX-7 looks like it drives","The factory 4 speaker stereo is junk like most other SUVs. I expect more from Mazda. Where is the aux input? Again, the audio system is a afterthought, but nothing that can't or hasn't been already fixed. Can you say Bazooka and Polk Audio? I can and it woke up the standard radio big time! Kaboom!"

I was having second thoughts about this vehicle.  Now, after owning the SUV for a month, I'm loving this SUV.  I originally started out to purchase the Nissan Maxima until I saw this vehicle on the highway.  It's roomy, the handling and braking is great, and I have gotten use to the ride.  ","I got the Black Cherry Mica (sexy color) and can't complain about the options (nav, moonroof, Sirrus, 6-disc CD, backup camera, auto start).

4.5,2008 Mazda CX-7 Grand Touring FWD,Eric ,01/12/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,3,5,The CX-7 does great at handling many driving conditions.  It has great passing power on the highway.  Avg. MPG on highway was 24.  Using premium fuel and using cruise control really helps. I am not impressed with the navigation system.  It is not as user friendly as the plug and go Garmins.  Its point of interest database is very limited. Instrument cluster is easy to read and has a dimming switch.  Bose sound system is great.  Outdoor temp. display can be read when you toggle between the A/C temp and outdoor temp. I would have liked it if the outdoor temp was always visible in display above the steering wheel.

Yes it's a 4cyl but it's a turbo, so don't expect standard 4cyl economy. From a performance standpoint the car does not feel super fast off the line, but passing can be a lot of fun under full throttle, especially from about 40mph as 80 comes up really quick! The ride is stiff due to performance, if you want a soft ride buy a boat. Stopping ability is outstanding and cornering is very good. This car is the best of both worlds if you ask me. Driver's seat fits well and controls are all within easy reach. ","Ergonomics of driver's position, Passing power, brakes and handling. Opt for the Bose sound system its worth the money! Manumatic makes driving very fun! Transmission in 08 is great, no hunting between 5th and 6th. You can run 87 octane with NO problems, a major plus. ",Heads up Display.

Excellent & funtional interior. The piano black trim on the instrument panel and steering wheel is very modern and appears like something from a luxury car (ex. Aston Martin DBS). Bose sound system is excellent.  The handling and feel of the car are on par with sport sedans.  The steering is more heavily weighted, which translates to excellent control with the feel of a German sedan.  Handling is smooth and progressive, with little body roll. 244bhp enginer is strong albeit with slight turbo lag.

Great looking exterior, good looking interior, excellent functional features. I got the GT AWD with the technology package - just love the way the nav screen moves to reveal the CD player.

The car has a sleek sporty shape to it and handles amazingly well, almost better than our old sedan.  It has a lot of pep for a 4 cylinder.  It is relatively comfortable and fairly decent on gas mileage.  We have put a about 1200 miles on it so far and really enjoy it.

My husband owns a Murano and this SUV blows it away from stand-still starts, but that might be because of the CVT in the Murano.  The CX-7 is a bit louder with regards to road noise compared to the Nissan, but much more fun to drive/sportier.  Don't be afraid of the 4 cylinder, it rocks.
