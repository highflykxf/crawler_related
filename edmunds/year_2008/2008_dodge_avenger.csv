4,I love this car!,mike ,09/07/2016,4,2,2,,,4,3,4,3,,,"Seems like I'm the only person that loves this car. I've got the 2008 sxt 2.7 L V6 in black, just a beautiful car and get compliments all the time, and for some odd reason every time a charger sees my car they try to speed by me or just get ahead of me?I find it pretty funny.I bought this with 80,000 miles on it and owned it for about a year and a half now and the only problem I've had mechanically was I had to replace my battery that's it! And of course changed  my oil twice, other than that it runs great and runs quiet and its pretty fast.Electrically I've had some issues I'm not gonna lie like rolling my window all the way down and it took like a hour to roll back up but just happened once.My passenger window had some issues for about a week but all of a sudden it stopped and works fine now.My car just shut off one time at a red light but started right back up and that only happened once last year, I took it to the dealer and they said the car is in good shape and they saw no problems.But this stuff was happening when I first got it but its been a year and a month without no issues it drives great.Maybe I just had to drive out the kinks?I really don't know but I haven't had any major issues at all, its far from a money pit I've had the car 19 months and only spent 150 dollars on a battery.Now these might be big issues for a lot of people who want a perfect car and just love to complain about everything but an issue with my windows for about a week is just not enough to give a bad review! My car shutting off one time on me? Ok I can see why people would complain but it happened once and never happened again I never made it a big deal the dealer said everything seemed good.The good things now.... The sound system is awesome I got six speakers all together and it sounds really good! love the mini fridge up front, Adjustable seats are great, this car also drives really good nice smooth ride with good handle, great exterior look, the interior is a little cheap but no big deal, still looks nice inside.Now the space in this car is great u have a lot of legroom and space, its very spacious.Not the most perfect car but I'm happy with it just a great car and a lot of fun to ride.You guys want a perfect car good luck on finding one because there's no such thing my friend has BMW and my other friend has a range rover sport those are expensive cars and they have had issues with their cars as well.People just love to complain, guess its just human nature.",,
1,"400,000 MILES AND GOING STRONG",David Smith ,11/05/2015,1,1,1,,,1,1,2,2,,,"I bought this car for my daughter after she got divorced in 2013. The car already had 331,000 miles on it. I knew the owner so I had  a complete history. Except for normal maintenance the only thing he had to do was a transmission solenoid because it was starting to leak.  We have spent some money on it this year: i.e; shocks,struts, tie rods, wheel bearing, brakes, tires, an oil pan and the alternator finally went. Not bad for the mileage and certainly expected. The car gets 90,000 miles out of tires, drives great in the snow and on the highway, She has put over 70,000 miles on it in two years with my granddaughter in a car seat the whole way. It is the original motor and transmission.  The 2.4 in 2008 went to a timing chain so no maintenance there. I work in a shop. I never see these for major repairs. I agree with some people that the interior is a bit cheap looking. Dodge did major improvements on their interiors in 2010. The styling is very attractive on the exterior. Like a mini  08 Charger. That being said I am a pragmatist. Dependability is more important to me. My lowest mileage car has 142,000 and we cover almost every make. It still is my favorite.  At 404,000 miles the car shows no sign of slowing down and believe me, my daughter  is not what you would call an easy driver. My youngest son totaled his car. Guess what I'm looking for now?",,
4,Great for the price and looks,Aaron Davis ,08/21/2015,4,4,3,,,4,4,3,4,,,"I have only had the car for a little over 2 months, but I really do love it considering I upgraded from a 2004 Dodge Neon SXT. But sadly enough my neon was smaller yet the avenger yields about the same gas mileage so that's a plus but odd enough my neon was faster than this lug of a car. 2.4L 4cyl engine just isn't enough to haul the weight of the car.. If I was buying this car i'd recommend getting the 2.7L or 3.5L. It doesn't have the performance I was expecting but I like the sleek performance look though and get compliments on it especially since mine has 17' Challenger rims on it.

It was just a crack. I drove this car daily and love itI had the SE so only a 4 cylinder. But it was enough to have a quick start and handled great for me. I made plenty of 1000 mile trips and was great. I skidded on ice and smashed into the side wall twice at 80mph and walked away without a problem. This car is amazing and it saved my life.

My service engine light came on last week, and they told me it was a large evap leak? My gas cap was fine, so there could be a small crack in my vapor hose. Nothing major.

The most recent time was just this Monday, July 12, 2010. My car's shifter was stuck in park and would not budge. I googled this problem and it seems like A LOT of people are having the same issues. I had it towed and the dealership had to replace the enitre shifter assembly. NOTE: My car only has 43,000 miles on it! Dodge needs to do a recall on the shifter problem! (Also, the cup cooler quit working, there was a high pitch noise on front drivers side, had to replace brake pads and rotors but still had vibration in the car, and my back drivers side door has window issues) My advice: Don't buy this car!

Within the first year of owning the vehicle it has shut off while driving at least 5 times. I was driving on the highway at 80 mph and the car shut off the wheel wouldn't turn and brakes wouldn't work. After the car stopped on it own, on the highway. I put it in park and turned engine off then back on. After that the car just stalls in the worst possibly moments. It doesn't move matter how many times I press the gas pedal until it wants. Then I couldn't get the car off of park. This is the worst car ever, I have been in and out of Dodge service b/c there is always something wrong.

3.125,Worst car I've owned,TERRIBLE CAR! ,06/07/2010,,,2,4,1,1,,4,4,5,4,"Bought my Avenger 5 months ago and have made several repairs. #1-Rotors were shot. Replaced rotors and had rear brake drums turned. #2-Air Filter lid was too tight. Broke when I tried to replace. Dealer had to order part and fix. #3-Car died twice when I came to a stop. Dealer had to update software on the car. Finally, my car got stuck in park this weekend. Now it is in the shop to get repaired again. This car is a joke.  Looks great on the outside. Made with cheap parts. NEVER buy a Dodge. I owned a Stratus before & didn't learn my lesson. As soon as I paid off my Stratus the transmission went out. I could either pay huge $$ for repairs or get rid of it. Folks, Dodge still hasn't learned.",Appearance on the outside is great.,Braking system needs improvements. Rotors are cheap.

Within 1 year, air conditioner failed due to a broken fan - that one took three tripe to two different dealer to fix.  Now back in the shop at 27K miles with another fan failure.  Also the passenger side window does not work and the transmission makes a horrid noise when it down shifts.

Its smooth and relaxed, but doesn't object when you floor it to overtake another car on the freeway. Mind you, 2,4 is already to the ""big"" side, as far as engines go in Europe on middle class sedans. Only bone to pick is that ""chill zone"" a bit useless for me, darkening rear mirror works only when somebody is really riding your tail and default battery is weak- couldn't get car started when outside was ""only"" -20C/-4F, gonna change it for next winter.

I drive for work and spend a lot of time inside my car. The second cup holder is located slightly under the console/armrest and it makes it difficult to use.  At 50,000 miles my radio now occasionally shorts out.  I also had a problem that it was just suddenly dying at stoplights however a factory computer update did solve this problem.

I have always had four cylinder, mainly manual transmission econocars.  Most of the cars were imports too.  I was put off at first by the negative consumer magazine reviews of the Avenger.  However, after I took it out for a long test ride, I was surprised how well it handled and accelerated. It corners really well for a car of its size and weight.  I really appreciate the kick of the six cylinder as I enter highways.  I no longer live in fear of getting mowed down by semi trucks in the slow lane.  I bought the car primarily for its looks but have not been disappointed by its reliability, performance and fuel economy. Critics be damned!!","I love its aggressive, distinctive looks! I've been told it is a real chick magnet with its metallic orange paint finish.  It has great acceleration, reasonable gas mileage, and great open road ride.

The 4 cylinder engine isn't dissappointing- it delivers adequate acceleration and plenty of power for me.

When I took it to the dealer I learned that there was a recall for the latches. During this year I have taken the car to the dealer five times and had three different recalls.  Most recently the belly shield fell off the bottom of the vehicle.

The c-pillar blind spot is a little bad also but I knew about that before I ordered this car. I plan on having this for a long time so after working for gm for 17 yrs.

It has a spacious interior and many extras that you wouldn't expect in a base model. Cool Zone cup holders, 2 part adjustable arm rest/storage console  and a folding rear seat with rear passenger armrest, makes for enjoyable road trips. It's easy to get in & out of and has plenty of headroom, which if you have tall and/or aging loved ones, this is a HUGE plus.  The exterior is probably the biggest surprise of all. Who would have thought you can get a car that looks that cool for under 20K? It certainly wouldn't have been me! ","The exterior is AWESOME!!!! Nice lines and a great look. I definitely turn heads with this car!Trunk is roomy and has low profile entry, which is nice when you have heavy packages. No need to lift up & over then set down.  ","Higher profile vehicle makes in the wind a challenge. Passing big trucks is not a problem though.  Car is a bit noisy inside, which may be attributed to being a base model?

The AWD doesn't get the performance suspension like the FWD does. The convenience package is worth the money.  While the interior is semi-cheap looking everything is very functional and is quite easy to clean. The seats I find to be very comfortable, especially on long rides.

After 700 miles of mostly highway/interstate driving I'm getting 29.8 mpg which is about what I expected and in my opinion this car is a great balance between power and fuel economy.

Still, the car is a head turner, drives well, comes with AWD and is perfectly fine for the daily commute while still being relatively affordable.  Seats have been updated (lucky for those of you who buy after July 07) and are significantly more comfortable. I recommend the car to anyone who wants to original, while still getting a good car.

Good Luck","My R/T was equipped with the MYGIG entertainment system which includes the audio, navigation, cellular bluetooth, and more into one easy to navigate package that is updatable through the computer.

And it's as though someone downshifted to first gear. It takes all the power the car has to get to the shoulder. Once restarted, the car performs fine for the rest of the trip. Leaving it with the service department won't help as they won't be able to recreate the problem.

I wanted the big Charger but the price was a little high so I settled for the little brother. No complaints though. This car looks tough and has the power and style to back it up. The 3.5 liter V-6 is impressive. Its no race car but it moves. It has 240 hp from the factory vs. Fords Mustang V- 6 210 hp. Any questions? The ride is unbelievable. My grandfather has a Cadillac and he feels the avenger rides better. Nice car good price get one! I would have like the navigation system but just too much. Would recommend to anyone.",Cooler in the dash. Where else can you get that?,"Bigger rear window. I feel like I can't see everything out the rearview mirror sometimes.The chrome trim on the interior needs to go, always dirty and it reflects the sun. "
4.375,Initial impressions,KCfromCanada ,10/02/2007,,,5,5,4,4,,5,4,3,5,"I was looking for a stylish affordable midsize AWD, especially for our winter. Considered the Fusion (didn't like the looks), Legacy (pricey) and some of the Chrysler models. Then saw the new Avenger and liked it (and the price) immediately. Good headroom and space, front and back. High sides on front seats may be uncomfortable for wider bottoms. Nice dashboard and interior lighting. Don't care much for the hard plastic finishes. Didn't bother with the Navigation system - the technology is changing too fast. Getting lots of admiring looks in the parking lot. ","Exterior looks, wheels. Pretty good performance for the price. Good solid ride and handling. DVD/MP3 capability. Autostick. Features for the price.","Rear pillars too big - blind spots. Gas mileage (so far) far below expectations (US14 mpg). Make the drink cooler optional - its useless for anything but cans. Battery has to be replaced by removing through wheel well! Lowest gears too close together - supposed to assist in performance, but..."
4.75,I absolutely love this car,Darrell ,09/23/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,I got one of the first on the lot and fell in love with it at first sight. Great styling. Pick-up is great but I'm no rabbit and the worst mileage I've gotten is 28.1 with 32.2 on a recent long trip. Sure is nice to drive 7+ hours before I have to fill up with cruise control set on 73. I'm over 60 and it's easy to get in and out of. The interior is well laid out and very quiet. Love that can cooler and 6 CD changer for long drives. Fold down rear arm rest is the best yet for passengers. Trunk is humungous and makes it easy to stash lots of stuff. Also love the dual-level console with the sliding arm rest so I can put it where I need it. The adjustable lumbar support is great.,"Mileage. After that performance, comfort of ride, lumbar support, stereo system, can cooler and how could I forget the lifetime warranty on the drive train.","16"" stock Firestone tires have to go because they don't hold traction on wet pavement. Driver's seat cushion can be rather hard on a long drive and the fabric is great for catching sesame seeds. Shiny trim around shifter needs to be dulled so it doesn't reflect the sun."
4.75,I love this car,nobody2u ,09/04/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I absolutely love this car. The way it looks, the way it drives, everything.  I finally got rid of my Jeep after 10 years & knew I was in the market for a sedan.  My first choice was the Sebring, but when we saw this car on the lot, I had to drive it and oh my God.  How I love this car.  I haven't seen too many on the roads yet, but I have a feeling this is going to be a very popular choice of vehicle for all people.","Color options, response time, when you step on the gas it goes like now, roomy glove box.",The passenger seat isn't anywhere near as comfortable as the drivers side.  There's a huge blind spot for shorter people and the jack is impossible to put back together after using it & there are no instructions anywhere to tell you how to put it back together.
5,A real hoot to drive,Jill ,08/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Avenger being my first car (going from trucks) in 15 years, I was a bit nervous about how well I would settle in to driving it.  But, this car has turned out to be a blast to drive. Smooth shifting and handling, responsive accelleration, better than stated fuel economy (19 mpg combo hwy/city) and a bunch of nifty creature comforts. I will be interested to see how well the AWD with ESP does on icy roads.  No regrets here!",Auto-stick for that little extra control...sharp look and exterior styling..heated/cooled cup holders and storage bin,"I miss my mute button on the stereo. If you let the low fuel light come on, then check the dte, it just says low fuel instead of the miles left. Would have preferred cloth seats, but leather required to get the other goodies."
4.625,My Dodge Avenger,Jase ,08/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I bought this car because I was looking for an affordable AWD car that also had great looks.So far I am very satisfied with my Avenger. The R/T trim adds the most powerful engine available and it is plenty powerful. The car can take off when I need it to. There is ample room, both front and back. Watch for the blindspots they are numerous. Overall I am very happy with the car and in retrospect would still definately buy it. ","MyGig is great. MyGig combines Navagation, radio, multimedia and Bluetooth into one system. All parts work very well. The voice command system is the best I have ever seen. Heated and cooled cupholders actually work. Automatic headlights comes with the car, which can't be found on the Lexus IS250","Remove the plastic on the rear windows it makes it very difficult to see out the back. Add an acoustic parking sensor because backing up is difficult with the high tail. The cooled compartment for beverages is trash. Don't leave carbonated drinks in there, or it will explode with pressure. "
4.75,Great Buy,Chris ,08/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I have been looking for a new midsize car for the last few months and have been to every dealer we have in town here.  This is the only care that stirred any emotional response from me and it did that very well.  I drove the SXT and the R/T, the R/T is defiantly the way to go if you like spirited driving.  I have only had the car a few weeks but I havent found any thing to regret this buy.  I really recommend this car for anyone shopping in the midsize market that wants to stand out and have fun doing so.",3.5 engine with the 6 speed is a match thats hard to beat from any make or price. The exterior styling sets it apart from the bland consertive midsize crowd. Interior design and layout carry over the edgy exterior lines.,A few more soft touch plastic surfaces 
5,2008 Dodge Avenger SE,2008 Dodge Avenger  ,07/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This car is peppy and takes hills very well. Sharp styling. Fun to drive. Check out the paint before you drive in home from the dealer. I noticed when I got home a few imperfections in the paint. I have Silver Steel metallic and it's great. Plenty of room on a trip with kids. Don't think because it's 4 cylinder that's a dog. It's a 16 valve. ,The cooler. Smooth ride. Gray interior. It feels racey and not like some soccer mom car. I love styling.,My interior is mostly gray. When it comes to the inside roof it's white. I don't like it or the white rear deck that reflects onto the window.
4.75,Nice ride,JMM ,06/28/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,5,5,"Just bought this car and couldn't be happier. Did quite a bit of shopping and comparing before I purchaed it. Looked at the Caliber hard too since it's the same platform. Handles great, very quick although slightly 'doggish' when the air is blasting 0-40. The transaxle shifting is very nice and it looks great. Gas mileage on the first tank was around 25.",Looks and transaxle shifting,Angle of headrest is a bit severe
5,Love It,David ,06/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Very sharp looking with a 3/4 Charger look. Rides firm, solid without being harsh. 6 speed automatic shifts quickly and smooth with no lag between gears. Mileage is same as advertised. Full of features like the upper bin that keeps soda cans cool and the hot or cold beverage holder in the console. Both ways work excellent. Interior lighting at night is awesome - almost like high end aircraft! ATC keeps temperature inside constant, no dialing up or down needed once you find your comfort zone. 3.5 engine is quiet and the exhaust has a really cool, high performance sound. ","Mileage, performance, and the hot/cold cup holder all are excellent!",Where's the Hemi? I'm always looking for more power!
5,This 4 cylinder moves!,Sue ,06/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This car is great up hills. It isn't noisy like someone had said. I have the dark/light slate seats and Silver Steel Metallic. The paint glistens in the sun. I am totally please with this car.,"Smooth ride. Excellent paint job.The body styling is an eye catcher. The standard options like air, alarm,are standard. Some brands charge for that stuff. I like the cooler for soda. ",A darker color for the rear deck. Light colors reflect onto the window. It makes it hard to see. The battery is in a bad place. 
4.75,Nice car,rapidnet_rick ,06/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I only have about 600 miles, but am happy thus far. I purchased an extended warranty, not happy with stadard warranty!  I hope the quality continues, and does not degrade over time. The AWD mileage is about 16 thus far with mixed driving, which isn't good, and about the worst for a car with its engine size and horse power. Wife's 2000 Nissan Pathfinder gets 17 under same conditions. Overall I like the car, and think it's a good value for the money.  ",MyGig Infotainment system!,"More horse power, better mileage. "
4.125,Good Start But....,MkHitech ,06/15/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,4,3,3,4,"We have the SXT with the 2.7L flex fuel engine. Rides far better on Michigan's roads than our Accord did. Interior design is also better. Unfortunately the interior has too much cheap, hard, and gray plastic. It's also slower than our 2001 Stratus ES with the same engine, and gets 5 MPG less. Somehow Dodge has made this engine sound like it came from a bread truck instead of the nice exhaust sound on the Stratus and smooth acceleration. The Avenger seems to ""fight"" it's way up to speed. We have the upgraded seats and even those are awful. No comfort at all and they squeak like crazy. Like the looks, love the design, but needs better quality, MPG, and be put on a diet. Close, but no cigar.",Cup cooler/warmer and LED interior lighting. Slick. Very smooth ride for a mid-size. Feels secure.,"Better interior materials quality, more interior color options. The Boston Acoustics sound system is way too boomy. The Infinity systems were much better. Better exhaust sound, no bread truck engines. Better mileage. Needs a manual transmission option"
5,Excellent buy,dwalk ,06/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"When I first saw the Avenger, I must admit I wasn't too much impressed.  Went to test drive one and got the car the same day.  For a 4cylinder it has great take off and the ride is very smooth.  If you want a Charger, but don't want the price and gas mileage, get the Avenger. The car dosen't burn hardly any gas, you can ride in style for days.",Beverage cooler/ smooth ride/ excellent on fuel,
4.625,Nice car,coonie ,06/07/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"Would be nice if gas mileage would increase. I am not getting 28mpg. Car handles very well. One mistake I made was to add the rain guards, they create too much of a blind spot. Overall I am very happy with it.",Dash design,"Head rests are very high, hard for short people to see around."
4.75,Bang for the buck,thebroker ,05/21/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My initial plans were to buy a Chrysler 300C this year. However, the significantly lower price and sexy looks of the Avenger caught my attention when I went to the dealership. I first testdrove the SXT, but then on impulse, I decided to purchase the R/T sitting on the showroom floor. I was amazed at the difference. The R/T is at least as much fun to drive as the BMW 328i I had a few cars back. I bought it three days ago, and I love driving it so much that I've already put a thousand miles on it. It's just fun to drive, and a great value for the money. Also, four people have plenty of room, which is something I didn't expect in a car this size. ","The beverage chiller is great, and the in-dash CD changer is pretty neat, too. Above all, though, my favorite feature is the 18-inch wheels, which make for a very smooth ride. ","A little wood or carbon fiber trim inside would be great. Perhaps I'm spoiled by higher-end cars, but the interior looks a little less classy than a car of this caliber should. "
5,Dodge Got it Right This Time,chevylover ,05/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5," I looked at a lot of cars before I bought this Avenger, and I must say I'm glad I waited for this car. The car is excellent in the city and on the highway. My R/T is loaded with every available option and I think this car will be a classic. Thumbs up to the Dodge Avenger designers.",The gadgets in this car are amazingly easy to operate and learn.,I would have liked a little more storage room for my CD's and DVD's.
5,Avenger,greg mazur ,05/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Perfect for my needs. I don't really need the size or power of the Charger/Mustang, but I liked the exterior lines/shape of the Charger. The Avenger's 4 cylinder engine is so quiet that you wouldn't expect the power behind it. Last tank was 32 mpg on the highway, which is what I had hoped for. Handles great in the city for the money.","I never had a spoiler before, but this one is very classy. The Boston Acoustics system is a must for music lovers. I can turn up the volume and still talk to the passenger as opposed to yelling over the noise. The fold down back seats have really come in handy for loading big items into the trunk.",
4.5,Map Light,08sxt2.7v6 ,04/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"Having owned this car less than a month, I couldn't say much about reliability.  I can say that it is fun to drive, and has gotten me compliments from anyone that's seen it. The ride is smooth and great for cruising around over long distances or for short trips, but this car still manages a feeling of control and sure- footedness in the turns.","Styling, LED maplights/accent lights. 2.7 Liter V6 ","The only thing I've found to complain about so far is the implementation of the front maplights. The driver side light was broken when I got the car and the mechanism feels cheap, though it looks great when everything is working."
4.625,You've got to drive it,fast is to slow... ,04/24/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"During the test drive, I was somewhat skeptical. But after 20 minutes on the road, I realized this is a really nice car. Maybe not as quick as some, but the looks are super. The vehicle handles extremely well. The mileage is good as long as you don't get heavy on the gas pedal. The interior is a little stark but functional. I must admit for the money the vehicle is road worthy and I am happy with my choice.",The evic system (premium instrument cluster) is very cool. Also the autodim mirror. ,Possibly dressup the interior. 
5,My 2008 Avenger R/T,Matt ,04/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I drive a 100 miles a day to and from work. So far I have only 1400 miles on my R/T but I love this car. The performance and looks makes driving fun again. It's comfortable and very driver friendly. ,"The steering wheel stereo controls, 6 C/D player, and the beverage cooler.",
3.875,Could be great,Dennis ,04/08/2007,,,4,4,3,4,,4,4,4,4,"This car certainly is an eye catcher which is why it sits in my driveway. My RT is black with chrome wheels and the spoiler. Lots of little goodies like the heat and cool cup holder, tire pressure monitor, fuel mileage monitor, remote start, autodim mirror with home link, Sirius satellite, and a few other things.",I like how the 6 speed auto is matched to the engines power. The car accelerates very briskly. The suspension and steering are also very good. It's a heavy car and that inspires confidence along with ABS and a ton of air bags.,"My biggest complaint is the interior. Could they put anymore plastic in it? I'd pay a grand more for some upscale looking materials. After all, it's where you spend most of your time. It's something I really didn't take note of until after I'd had it a few days and you get past the initial sparkle."
5,Top of the line.,Kurt Kostman ,03/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Well I just bought my car on the 21st of March of 2007, and in the short time I have had it I love my new car, The 4 CDR engine is extremely snappy and the acceleration is incredible. The ride and the mostly sound proof cab makes highway noise barely noticable and an outstanding ride. I highly recomend it for anybody.","The stereo, and everything the computer in the car offers to the driver.",Softer seats.
5,Avenger is a great Car,Michael  ,03/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought a Dodge Avenger from online photos and I must admit, I did not go crazy when I first saw it.  However, when I drove this car I really fell in love with it. It handles really well, and I have the power to pass and go when I need it no problem.  I also like the extra elecrical outlets and cup holders, the fold down seats and the huge trunk on a good sized car. Not too big, not too small. Just right. The price is fabulous  I dare anyone to compare this car with anything in its size on the road today.  ","Sunroof, cup warmers. Cola holders, fold down seats. Huge trunk.  Good get up and go!  It really flys on the highway  ","Heated seats might be a plus, but the auto-temp heats up so fast it is not really a problem  Navigation system is not priced competitively. But the extra plug allows me to use my own portable system fine. "
