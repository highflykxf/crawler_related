Purchased to pull a 38', 13000# fifth wheel both on short trips to the lake and longer cross country trips. The truck now has 79000 miles on it with about 90% of them pulling the fiver and the observations are as follows: 1) Fuel economy sucks, with (9 mpg) or without (12 mpg) the trailer. 2) With the Lariat trim package, leather, etc., interior comfort and appointment are like sitting in the family room at home. 3) More than enough power and road stability to pull 13000+# regardless of conditions or locations, has seen the plains, mountains and deserts, on interstate, U.S. and state highways as well as county roads, city streets and dirt country roads across 16 states and just keeps on going like a dream. Have 2 more trips, 10 more states and about 6000 more miles planned this summer and have had no experiences that would lead me to expect anything different. and 4) maintenance and repair costs have been minimal and limited to standards scheduled trips to the dealers quick lube location. Have owned Dodge, Chevy and Ford trucks (mostly Ford) ( currently also own 2009 F150 STX extended cab w/90000 one owner miles), from half-ton to one ton and this one has done nothing but solidify my feelings that Ford is ""Built Tough"" and will continue to be the truck that graces my driveway.",,

Blood red, dark tint, black wheels, leather interior, 6” lift, the works.  CarFax was 100% clean with regular maintenance at dealerships and only two previous owners here in sunny Arizona. WORST VEHICLES HANDS DOWN THAT I HAVE EVER OWNED!!! I have previously owed 2 Super Duty’s and both had the V10 in them and also owned one F150. Two with 6” lifts and the other with an 8” lift.  First off the V10 never let me down, never broke down or stranded me and had decent pulling power.  Those V10’s are bullet proof.   Had no issues with the F150 either…Let me list all the issues with my new Super Duty and diesel engine in last 10 months:•	Fan Clutch went out •	Both (yes 2) ERG coolers out •	Injectors went out •	Fuel dumped in to oil•	Coolant burned up in ERG’s•	Steering box …out…had it replaced•	Back up sensors…out•	4X4 won’t engage•	All controls on steering wheel quit working….. completely out •	Random sensors go out shutting down both turbos and putting truck in limp mode.  One time shut down while heading up North.•	And those F’ing rear seat shoulder belts rattling on the plastic   This truck is a piece of crap that has cost me over $5,000 in repairs within 10 months of owing it.  As soon as I cut a check to the repair shop for $1,500 on this round of repairs…driving straight to a dealership and trading it in.  Feel sorry for the next fool that gets this truck.",,

I get my oil changed, separator drained, and fuel filter changed as required, every 3 months, by Ford and its on record and its about $225 each time. Apparently even though Ford says this is a diesel truck, it hates diesel.  The fuel system automatically sucks up all the water and junk thats in diesel before it uses the gas.

It has tons of power and the interior is all leather. Its the most loaded truck I've ever owned. Unfortunately, it has a lot of problems. I bought it used with about 120,000 miles on it which I thought was decent mileage considering its diesel. At 135,000 miles, I replaced the starter followed shortly by the engine. After that, it was the clutch fan, a short in the electrical system, and numerous other problems including the latest where the hydro boost for the brakes over heated and took out the power steering pump costing $1700. Total repair cost in 45,000 miles has been over $23,000. Trading it off on a new Tundra ","Really like the high quality materials used in the interior. It has power driver and passenger seat, which I've never had in a truck before. I quite often refer to it as my Cadillac. It has lots of power and the times I've needed it as a workhorse, it seems pretty good. ","This truck has serious reliability issues. Not only is it really expensive to fix, its also really inconvenient for it to be in the shop for a couple days every 5 or 6 weeks. The paint has a lot of chipping. It has persistent problems. The window motor on the passenger side works sporadically. The cruise also doesn't work all the time. I've replaced one rear axle seal 4 times. I'm very disappointed. I thought this truck would last me at least another 100,000 miles after I bought it and after putting on 45,000, I'm trading it off. I'm upside down on my loan but I just can't afford to keep repairing it."

Dealer said water got into the Trans Control Module, which is mounted under the truck. Not covered under warranty = $1200 bill. A week ago the steering gear locked up at 84k miles. No warranty = $1100 bill. Also last week the ""check engine lite"" cam on. Dealer says it was a bad EGT sensor. No warranty = $302 bill. Then today the brand new steering gear blew out and sprayed fluid all over the driveway. Not what I expected from a SUPER DUTY. ",The 6.4L Diesel tows my 40' toy hauler with ease though the fuel economy is pretty horrible even compared to Dodge and GM trucks pulling the same loads.

Now at 118,000 miles I need another radiator and am told I probably need a new oil cooler, and that the engine may have blown head gaskets.

I've developed a few nasty squeaks in the dash that are getting worse with age.

The PTC heater is a great option for Michigan winters. The heated seats are good for that too.
They are ON/OFF, not adjustable.

The radiator issue is a recall, and I had mine replaced at 35k -- since then I had no problems.  Towing:  I tow a 38ft 12k fifth wheel and live in Colorado (high altitude).  The DPF while in regen will increase EGTs resulting in the turbo fans to go off and sometimes resulting in the truck going into limp mode.  I find this to be this trucks serious flaw.

5,Update on 2008 Super Duty,jdf2007 ,08/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have 08 F-350 Super Duty DRW with 6.4 Power Stroke and 4.10 rear end. Drove truck on 2200 mile trip towing a 6500 LB. boat with a 600 LB. quad in the bed. Avg. mpg was 13.2 for the trip. Mixture of mountain towing and flat lands. Truck performed exceptionally well...great power and brakes. Now that I'm back with 5000 miles on truck I have seen 17 mpg empty. Truck is breaking in well and mpg is climbing. This truck is the best tow vehicle I've ever driven.  It has the guts to pull hard on 6% grades with no sweat.,Cab. 6.4 Power Stroke diesel. Great sound system. Rides like a car.,20mpg would be great...don't think we'll see that!  Also cannot get 4th gear on shift column...only 3rd. Only way to fourth is with down shift from accelerator.
4.875,Super Duty Rules,JDF2007 ,07/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have 1200 miles on F-350 Super Duty with 6.4 Power Stroke and I have already seen 15 mpg at constant 65 mph with cruise.  I see 12-13mpg in town.  Truck tows like a locomotive...rides like a car.  Best ride in any dually out. Leather seats are comfortable, cab interior is carlike.  Stereo sound is great.  My wife likes to drive this truck better than her SUV...speaks volumes about how well it handles. No diesel will give best fuel economy till at least 5000 miles.",Cab Interior...6.4 Power Stroke...carlike ride...great audio system...good build quality and fit and finish.  Truck is very quiet.,Get fuel economy up to 20mpg and this is the best truck for the money on the planet.  
4.75,Twin Turbo Power!,W.F. ,06/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I just picked up my fully loaded '08 diesel F-350 long bed dual rear wheel beauty one week ago and I have already gotten tons of compliments on it (at least one a day.) The power is amazing, the engine is deadly silent and it handles like a 1/2 ton! I plan to pull around 17,000#'s with a 5th wheel in the future, but for now it pulls around my 7,000# boat like it's not even there. The interior is by far the nicest I have ever seen in a truck. So nice that my wife even likes to ride in it! She has hated all of my other trucks and would only want to take her BMW until now.Thanks Ford!","The soft leather seats, the quiet operation, the power slide rear window and sunroof, the navigation and beautiful sounding stereo are all on the top of my list. But by far the look inside and out is my favorite thing about it. ","I think bi-xenon lighting should be standard at this price. Plus I would like to see one-touch windows up and down for both passenger and driver. Furthermore, I have only been averaging around 9.8 MPG in the city with no load and I am hoping for a substantial increase after the break-in period?"
4,"The Diesel Mileage is Terrible, warning",L Norman ,05/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,3,4,1,4,"I advise you to read this if you are considering the diesel. Love the feel, the drive, the interior and and comfort.  Please Ford, take this lemon back!  I am getting 8mpg highway - no load! Less than 6MPG with a load. Ford are aware and will do nothing about it. As far as they say, they never claimed better mileage, just better emissions.  ","The look, same reason we all bought it",Mileage
4.875,Well worth the wait!,Madmev ,05/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I had to wait over 3 months to take delivery of my ""King Ranch"", and it was well worth it! It has a sleek interior, smooth ride, and a powertrain that refuses to quit! Pulling a trailer seems effortless and still delivers a great ride. The 6.4L diesel is not only quiet enough to pull through a fast food line without turning off the engine, you can actually travel down the road without raising your voice to talk to your passengers. Not all trucks are able to claim that. Ford has succeeded with a very stylish and impressive truck!","The amazing powertrain, comfortable seats, and smooth ride. The mirrors refuse to let any vehicle hide in a blind spot. Overall, it drives like a car, but tows like a truck on steroids!",Bluetooth capability would help promote safer driving while talking on the cell.
4.875,A First Rate Redesign of the F Series,Kevin ,04/05/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"In my 1 week of ownership I have found my new F350 Diesel to be a great vehicle: fast off the mark, looks good, and decent economy for such a large vehicle. The interior seems to have a solid and upmarket feel - no cheap jiggly plastic, or rattles. In a word: car-like. My usage involves light towing, lumber yards, 5 passenger trips, and also some commuting when the car is in for service. This vehicle is huge, but comfy enough to be driven anywhere. Ford had to get this revision of the F series perfect, and I think they have very nearly succeeded. It is a large improvement over my 2003 F250 - which was 2 generations of truck ago in the Ford Super Duty line. I might ditch the car!","Engine is a winner, interior is quiet and solid, good looks, great stereo with built-in Sirius, improved electric rear sliding window mechanism, solid acceleration, quiet highway operation, solid planted feel on the road.",I would like to see an adjustable auto- on light sensor (on cloudy days and at sunset it clicks on/off until you override with the ON switch). One touch UP on windows (currently only one touch down). Bluetooth support would be very nice. Bi-Xenon lighting would be great too.
4.75,It's a Diesel,Scott ,03/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I love this truck!  It is the first diesel I have owned. Takes some getting used to.  Honestly Ford wasn't even on my list.  Their build quality in the past left something to be desired.  I have to say the fit and finish is perfect.  The interior materials lost that ""plastic"" feel.  This cab feels luxurious.  The diesel pulls right out, you can really feel the torque.  My purchase was intended to pull a fifth wheel but haven't purchased that yet so no info on the towability.  The crew cab is awesome, it holds all my tools previously kept in the bed of my Chevy. Turning radius is great, U-turns are no problem.  That was unexpected but welcome.","Not just one, I like the folding rear seats, the interior is comfortable, the diesel is quiet enough to have a conversation.  The new front end looks really cool and also allows all radiators to breathe.  My first tank averaged 17mpg and will probably get better.",Due to the exacting emissions and Ultra Low Sulphur fuel they recommend not using bio-diesel beyond a 5% mix.  I think alternative fuels are going to be gaining acceptance and this one excludes them.
5,First 6.4 L Diesel in San Diego,J.L. ,03/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I ordered my 2008 F350 SRW Super Duty back in October with the 6.4 L twin turbo diesel engine, 5speed auto in a crew cab with 4X4 and a long bed. I took delivery on February 13th and have loved driving this monster ever since. The interior looks like an F-150 but is unique to the Super Duty line. The leather seats are the most comfortable in any heavy pick-up but the quiet diesel with jet like thrust is what Ford got right. I don't have to shut down the engine to order at the drive through (not possible with a Dodge/Cummins) and acceleration is a silent, progressive shove in the back without any turbo lag or whine. This truck rides like a half ton, goes like sports car, and tows like a Peterbuilt.","My wife does not complain when I want to take the truck up to Los Angeles because the quiet ride, soft seats and creature comforts like dual zone climate controls with rear DVD player for the kids. Cab is like a luxury sedan but I can load 4K lbs. in the bed and still tow 12K lbs. Simply awesome.","Ford really needs to put a back-up camera on these trucks. The import trucks have them now and would really add to safety.  Voice guidance on the navigation is a little cheesy but is easy to use. No latch bases for car seats, you have to use the shoulder belts but it does have the top anchor points."
