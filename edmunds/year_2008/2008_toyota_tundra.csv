3,No more Toyotas for me!,Glenn MacNichol ,04/11/2016,3,2,3,,,3,3,2,3,,,"I am a Toyota fan from way back.  At the time I purchased my 2008 Tundra, new, my family owned three Toyotas, and my extended family owned 7 more.  I was quite excited to replace my 1999 F150 with a Tundra, planning to keep it for a long time, lots of miles.  I was quite disappointed with the result.  I purchased through Mike Johnson Toyota, Hickory NC in 2008.  Within a week of driving the truck I noticed unpredictable acceleration, as if the transmission would downshift and upshift at incorrect times.  At times, this was dangerous, say, when pressing the accelerator into a turn at an intersection.  I brought it to the dealership, and was told I would 'get used to it,' that 'it will learn.'  It never learned, and the dealer refused to acknowledge a problem.  I later moved, and a second dealer's chief mechanic agreed it was not normal, but also stated that when he had worked on such problems in the past, it did not always correct, and he would need the regional manager to weigh in.  Well, the regional manager never responded to my inquiry, and 8 years later the problem is not fixed, and never even officially acknowledged by Toyota.  I drive the vehicle only when I need, mostly on the highway, but it is by far the WORST DRIVING truck I have ever owned.Also, radio/aux input failed within 6 mo of purchase.  Dealer stated covered under warranty, but radios were on backorder.  I finally got one after 2 years, only to find the aux input was also defective, independent of the radio.  Dealer would not fix it, stating it was 'no longer under warranty.'Also, dealer sold me a bedliner, which cracked in the corner before seeing any hauling use.  Dealer noted it was 'aftermarket' and Toyota was not responsible for it, and dealer would not stand behind the product they sold.All the while I tried unsuccessfully to get these problems fixed, dealer repeatedly provided me with unwanted 'Recall repairs' I guess because Toyota was paying them to provide them.Toyota makes mostly good vehicles, but when a lemon comes off the assembly line they and their dealerships turn a deaf ear.2-3 stars for the Tundra, zero stars for Toyota as a company.Since 2008, I have purchased Honda, Hyundai, and am looking at an F150 to replace the Tundra soon.",,

After started if i listen close i can here what i think are the lifters making slight noise. My mechanic did not listen to it but when i told him he said i will need to replace motor soon that because who ever owned it before me didn't change oil enough clogged up timing chain, said it could lock up engine in a week or 2 years, and told me to purchase a 36 mo. engine replacement warrantee with him since i have 30 days to get one. all the forums I've been too says this is common to 5.7  and toyota knows it.

4.25,Excellent,dufour ,06/02/2013,,,3,4,5,3,,5,4,5,5,I bought my truck 3 years ago. It has 29 km. I pull a camper (5200 pounds) and the tundra is doing a great job. Gaz millage is high but what else can I expect from a 5.7 liters engine. The power is impressive. This is my thirdtoyota truck (old tacoma V6 3.0 and the last model V6 4.0 liter) and I have no fear about atrting the engine even when I going to my cabin on winter and start it after a week end of minus 35 (I live in northern Quebec).I change to rear brakes at 51km and a little noise is coming once in a while from the dash board on the passenger side. Toyota tried to fix the problem under warranty but the noise came back again in a short period of time.

2.625,Problems Galore,aternie ,12/20/2012,,,3,1,2,2,,4,4,2,3,"I bought this Tundra hoping to get that Toyota quality. At 45,000 miles, the radio just quit working. At 60,000 miles the drivers door lock actuator quit working immediately followed by the front passenger door lock actuator and then the drivers side rear door lock actuator. The driver's door is just a nuisance but the other doors are now totally useless since there are no keyholes for those doors. At 65,000 miles I have an oil leak and a water pump leak. In other words, at less than 80,000 miles, I have about $4,500.00 in repairs. So much for Toyota quality. As others have said, the body dents too easily. Other than that it is a powerful truck. I just would not recommend one. ",Very Powerful truck. Nice and roomy cab.,Better job of engineering a full sized truck.

I have put it to work hauling and towing and it has not failed me. As discussed below,  Toyota put cheap tires on the truck. I shouldn't have to replace them at 25K. One of the tires had a crack in it. The local Firestone dealer told me that they tires were to light for the truck. If do your own general maintenance such as oil changes, you will hate Toyota. Changing the oil is time consuming and difficult. See below. I think the under-seat storage bin should be standard. I recommend it. The gas mileage has been as expected: 11-14 in town and 16-18 on the highway. ",Love the power and control off road and in the snow. The truck has met all of my expectation. I do not regret my purchase at all. ,I replaced OEM tires at 25K. The front tire started to crack. Interior design is odd. The hanging file section in the middle console is a waste of space.

I bought a left over '08 model for my wife and she can't keep me out of it. The performance for a full sized truck is amazing. My daily driver is an '06 Nissan Altima SE-R, and the truck is as fun to drive as the car is. I'm actually thinking about getting rid of the car to buy one of the Tundra TRD Sport Editions for myself. Gas mileage is my only complaint, HOWEVER, I knew it wasn't going to be great when I bought it. Let's face it, in order to tow 5 tons, you gotta give somewhere. Having said that, it still gets 18mpg on the highway. ","These Tundras are SEXY, PERIOD! Body lines - Beautiful. Interior - Super.

The quality of the body material is terrible. You can literally leave a dent in the truck if you smack it w/ your hand...this is not ""truck"" quality.

I have hauled my family + car up and down the Rocky and Cascade Mountains with both trucks.  As much as I liked the 4.7L,  it knew the weight was there.  But as I expected, the 5.7L didn't flinch or break a sweat going up the steep grades. Some owners find the engine braking annoying. However, I find that when you are hauling and going down a steep grade it allows for the driver to have control of the vehicle + whatever you're hauling.  Overall,  this truck has exceeded my expectations.","Power, design and the amount of room in the crewmax. On long trips, room is highly recommended.",A minute suggestion.

Now this is no F250, but I do pull 6000 pounds with it and it's pretty good. Without the trailer it's just plain fun to drive. Of course mashing the accelerator cost you lots of money because the fuel mileage is pretty poor. I'm mostly highway and I average around 16 mpg.  The price I got a year ago was incredible.

I was blown away when my calculations showed 21.7 mpg in combo city/highway driving (my 04 Camry gets 28 mpg).  The Tundra has tons of power, space, and is a delight to drive.

Overall the Tundra is a great truck but like all other vehicles it could have some improvements. But Toyota does a lot of things to there vehicles that the domestic companies do not do like Toyota puts sealer on the edge door seams to keep from rusting and spray pvc under the vehicle and in the wheels wells to reduce road noise and to prevent rust, sprays antichip along rocker panels to prevent rock chips.

No one can believe how sexy this truck is, it is unique and turns heads everywhere I go. It is easy to drive and gets good gas mileage.

Combined with a silky smooth 6 speed automatic transmission, 4.30 monster rear axle and enormous disc brakes on all four corners, Toyota has delivered a powertrain that will move this beast from 0-60 in just a hair over 6.0 seconds.

I am very demanding of my vehicles and have no tolerance for rattles, design flaws, quality, etc.  No disappointments with this truck so far.  I have driven the truck in rain, snow and ice.  Rarely need 4WD to get around even in the worst conditions.  Tons of power, excellent transmission & brakes.  Averaging 17.1 combined mpg on new AT tires.  Tows like a diesel.  Amazingly quite and solid road manners.  Unbelievable amount of room in front and rear seats. All of the gadgets (bluetooth, rear camera, nav) work perfectly. I have purchased over a dozen new trucks (all brands gas and diesel). So far, the best truck I have ever owned.","Powerful, smooth engine.  Excellent transmission and brakes.  I do not know how I lived without the rear camera or bluetooth.  Sunroof and power rear window have also been a pleasure.  Tons of room in cab and storage areas throughout the cabin.  Incredibly quiet on rough roads and in high winds.",I had one minor dash rattle but fixed in about 5 minutes myself.  Stock tires are horrible on anything but dry pavement. Gas gauge is way off.  Headroom is tight with SR if over 6'.  Homelink buttons do not light up.  IPod integration?  Paint seems a little less durable. Tailgate feels underbuilt.

I live in Colorado high country & drive in all the worst conditions & environments list above. The truck is a city or highway vehicle. No front tire chains. Clearance too low. Also; if you wear a shoe or boot size larger than Japanese size 8 watch out for the driver-side floor heater duct. My muddy boots (size 12) kept hitting the duct when I applied the brakes. The bed is to high for side access without a step stool.",The bed light can be shut off or on.,Higher driver-side heat duct.  Lower bed sides.  More clearance.

The ride is very nice - lots of power on demand.  I have to say my Jayco G2 - if not for my rear view its like its not behind me.  The NAV and Radio are a little bit of a reach.  The seats could use more of a wrap around lumbar support.  Other then that - I really love the truck.  I have every option you can get!",Like the rear window opening.  Also the seats (have the tan leather) very clean finish easy to use.  Bluetooth for the phone.  The radio rocks!  The sonar alarms are nice as well.,Like the seats to have more of a wrap around the sides in the lower lumbar.

I have a heavy foot and I do mostly in town driving and I get about 14 to 15 which is not bad for a V8. I've owned a 97 Ford F150 ext. cab 4.6 V8 and a 04 Chevy Trailblazer ext. with a 6cy. that got worse and all of the other brands have a lot more problems.",Lots of interior room. Lots of power.

However, careful recording of fuel consumption (not towing) reveals that we get nearly 18 MPG on the highway, and 17 around town, which is quite a bit better than the older Tundra. The new one has the 5.7 liter V8. Bring the trailer home over The Cascades, the truck had no problem maintaining speed up the steep grade to Government Camp on Mt.

4.75,Very Satisfied,Bpa49 ,11/23/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"Before buying I researched and read reviews about every brand of truck in this class. The Tundra was by far the most vehicle for the money especially after the rebates that were going on in July, 08. The SR5 trim level has all the most common standard features that you would not have on a similar priced Ford or Chevy. Has plenty of power with the 5.7, very comfortable to drive, quiet, and even the gas mileage isn't bad for a 6000 lb 381 hp vehicle. I travel 42 miles per day on the hilly interstates of western PA and average 15.6 mpg. On a 600 mile trip I averaged 18+. Only complaint is sometimes the transmission downshifts a little too easily  even going down a moderate hill.",Large Crew max cab. More back seat room than any 4 door pick up I've seen. Engine power. 6 speed transmission. Only 5200 miles so far but no problems at all.,A little longer bed on the Crew Max model. Running boards standard. I don't really notice much difference with the tow/haul mode when selected as compared to the Ford or Chevy set up. There is a very noticeable difference in the shift points on the Fords the tow/haul mode option.

My last trouble truck was a Dodge, and I would give anything to get that truck back, as the troubles with that Dodge pale in comparison. I've had the Toyota less than a year, and it is up for sale (I wanted to keep it at least 5 years).

I despise the VSC but I am told the sway bar will help eliminate the frustration I have with it. My brother who has only had cars was impressed with the smoothness of the ride (we had 2 sportbikes in the bed and were at 80 on the highway). My girlfriend/wife loved it some much that she bought a DC limited. Being a full size Chevy guy my whole life I have been truly impressed.," Power! Power! Power! Find it comfortable. Ample room. Storage is great! Mpg is better than expected but would love even more! Who wouldn't? tailgate is great, especially next to my friends Ford! But it could use some extra strength.",VSC annoys me!

It does 60 mph plus on any of the grades where my F150 struggled along 38-42 mph in first or second gear.   Its down right fast when I'm not towing.  So far I'm getting 11.9 MPG towing the boat in the mountains and 17.5 commuting and around town.

I like Corolla, Camry because they are reliable, gas efficient, good looking, keeping their value really well.  A huge mistake was made when I traded in my Camry for a Tundra. I wanted a truck to haul my boat sometimes and for more fun.  Auto experts have rated the truck very high. I must say, Edmunds you did totally wrong:  Gas mileage: 10-13 MPG. Performance: No fun at all. Engine is very loud. When hauling, it is extremely loud. I miss my Camry very much. Quality: Cheap all around. Styling: too ugly. Reliability: 2 dealer visits per month ",I could not find one so far.,"I suggest Toyota stopping making this truck. For a long term Toyota fan, I am very disappointed to own Tundra. I am thinking buying Honda next time."

This one drives really nice, lots of power, great handling, plenty of room in front and the backseat is awesome. If you are looking for a big truck this is it. The only drawback the interior is cheaply built for a Toyota, too much plastic which scratches very easily. The dash lay out needs some work, the radio and controls needs to shift closer to the driver's seat.","Power, comfort. Good exterior looks.",Back up camera should be standard. Gauges are hard to see. Radio is too hard to reach. Needs arm rest like the sequoia for comfortable long rides. The transmission down shifts to easily when descending.

The ride is harsh and the leather seats are not shaped for leg comfort at least in the front.

It tows without any issues at all.  I have only had two warranty issues so far, the radio and interior support pillar trim.  It seems that when the dash gets HOT from the sun the trim sometimes moves out of place and warps.  The transmission seems to have a mind of its own, it shifts how and when it wants to, it does not seem to be learning.  Sometimes it is smooth and I can hardly feel it shift and other times it will slam the truck in gear. I am having it road tested on the next service and the transmission computer may have to be reset (according to the dealer).",Engine and handling.

I guess Toyota is going to make a big hole on the sales for the big three. No doubt that the new drive train's performance comes as a result of Toyota's research and investment on its Formula 1 team.

The plastic insert that fits around the lugs? $98.43. If you do the math, just the wheels and plastic insert is over 10% of the full purchase price of the truck. Toyota charges big time for parts.

4.875,Best truck out there,Rob ,07/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have been a GM guy for decades. I came out of a 2005 Chevy Avalanche and was going to get a 2008 Avalanche until I test drove the Tundra Crewmax. What a vehicle! I test drove the best GM had to offer, the 2008 GMC Sierra Denali, and this beat it hands down in power, quietness, smooth ride, interior storage, and all the electronic gadgets. Love this truck. ","Stereo (JBL), rear seat room, quiet and smooth ride with power.",Better mileage but didn't buy it for the mileage. I have a motorcycle for that.
5,First Toyota,William ,07/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Drove Silverados for ten years. Last new was a 1998 with 128,000 plus miles combination city and highway.  Was in excellent shape when I gave it to my daughter and bought the Double Cab SR5 with big V8.  Tundra handled a lot tighter than Ford or Chevrolet with less effort.  Ride is smooth on and off road. Comfortable in front seats and back according to my 6'4"" son-in law. Still in break in period with 1500 miles on it.  Driving 70 to 75 MPH with air conditioner on and cruise set I average 19.8 MPG highway and city is 15.3 with air conditioner on.  I do avoid stop and go traffic as much as possible which has helped the gas mileage a lot. Better gas mileage than my 1998 Silverado. ","Handling, stopping ability, ride. Plenty of room for cargo in standard bed. I did put a Tonneau cover on which also improved the gas mileage by at least 3 to 4 miles per gallon highway and city.  Overall styling.  Several people committed on how they liked the style.",Place radio and cruise controls on steering wheel.  These controls are too far from driver.  Cruise control is awkward to set.  Needs to be more heads up displays as in aircraft. Little less plastic in the interior would be nice but weight to fuel burn ratio is why plastic is being used so I accept this.
4.875,Interior design,Mark ,07/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I had a 2002 Tundra and decided to trade it in for an 08 and couldn't believe the size difference. It is very quiet, but seems to have more bounce to the suspension, which is not rough though. The interior change I hated to see go is the sun visor redesign, which has no pull out extension when turned to the driver window. The sun is always past it!! Also, the visor in front of the main visor is gone. Both of these in combination was the perfect sun block no matter where the sun was. Now I am blinded from front and side. The front visor is worthless as far as I am concerned. It is too short. "," Leg room has greatly improved.  A/C controls are more accurate, and not just 3 settings. Also seems to cool the cab off much faster. Front and rear sync is great. More leg room in back seats. Two glove compartments,and two in center console. Doors have more storage compartments. Two for drinks.","Put the same sun visors as the older  (02) back.  Loved it, and being in TX. makes a difference."
5,Very nice truck,dj ,07/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a quiet, powerful, well mannered truck. Our biggest surprise after getting the truck home and using it for a while is how huge this thing is. It seemed good sized at the dealership but must have thought the extra effort needed to climb up inside the cabin and not being able to reach over the side of the bed was due to the way it was on display. Nope, it's just huge. Not a complaint just a realization. Ours is a standard suspension 4X4 with Michelin road tread tires inflated to Toyota's recommended pressure, which makes the ride in the cabin dead quiet and silky smooth. ","In my base truck, the features offered are just right. Using it for work, it is nice to have not paid for unwanted urban toys and to find quality, easy to clean plastics on armrests and other surfaces that will get dirty.","Though the bed does look great, if Toyota finds many owners miss being able to reach into the bed from the sides of the truck as I do (I'm over 6' tall),  lower bed sides might be an improvement.

From the comfort of my power seat, and the interior design, the fit and finish of the exterior, the performance, the handling, and my favorite of them all is the body style of my tundra SR5, it is sweeeet. There is NO pickup truck out there on the market today that even comes close. I love my Tundra.","Eight way power seat, lots of leg and head room, tilt and tele wheel, power assist tailgate, 6 disc cd player, the comfort of being able to reach all the buttons and knobs, the duel temp controls, very large brake system, nice interior light system so you can see at night in the cab, etc.",I really can't think of one.

Once you drive it, all others pale in comparison.  Power is tremendous, braking is phenomenonal.  It drives like a sports car but is a truck.  No complaints after 4000 miles.  Very tight, quiet, phone syncs flawlessly, excellent radio.  The best features:  full back window sliding down and the sunroof.  It's the next best thing to a convertible.

I thought it would do a little better, but I'm sure the lift has something to do with the low MPG.  Lots of power and the stereo system is pretty good (JBL).  A lot of cargo room, I'm 6'3"" and I fit comfortably.  I am a Chevy guy, but I wanted to try the Toyota.  I don't think you can go wrong with the Silverado or Toyota, the others just can't compete.

Space for 3 growing boys on long trips, ease of towing large RV trailer, budget, and safety were our main criteria for this purchase.  We custom ordered a Grade (which is exceptionally equipped for a base model).  Love it, love it, love it!  Get 16-18 MPG when not hauling, much better than the 12-14 on my last Ford F-150 Crew.  Really wanted head restraints and shoulder belts in all 3 rear seats for safety.  Leave it to Toyota to also provide the only front bench seat with foldable middle seat (for armrest) or passsenger seat that also has shoulder belt and head restraint.   ","Towing is a dream, much more secure and stable than the Ford also.  Love the automatic rear window too.  Highly recommend all the way around.

I purchased the 5.7 V8 and the power is there when you need it.  The interior of the truck does have some nice features, but could use some upgrades as far as reducing some of the plastics.

Many complained about mileage, I have been getting 17.5 mpg on average with ""mostly"" responsible city driving. For a large v8 truck I feel that is great. The fuel guage drops quickly from full but slows as the level gets lower, and like every other review, when the light comes on there is 4-6 gallons left. The truck is very quiet inside and comfortable with ample room and storage. A/C and radio controls seem far away, the grade radio is less than desireable. Tow mirrors are good but add minor wind noise. Overall I am extremely happy. It's not a super duty, but it's an excellent truck and fun too.","Power, the 5.7 is more efficient than the 4.7, but both are great. Fold down center console/seat, very versatile. Quiet cabin and great fuel mileage for a truck make it a nice driver. The ride is compliant (non trd models) but still handles heavy loads well. Dual glove boxes and tons of storage.","Tighter steering on highway, rough roads make it SEEM as though it wants to dart around, although it is very stable.Better base radio,struggles to pick up local stations.

2,Big Dissappointment,Mr. Toyota ,05/25/2008,,,2,4,1,1,,3,2,1,2,"I got this truck because of Toyota's reputation for quality and a bit of over excitement.  I should have done my homework.  There are numerous areas for major improvement with this truck.  The thing is just not solid.  The bed and especially the tailgate is cheaply manufactured.  The thing that annoys me most is that since I got the factory installed trailering package they changed the axle ratio so now I get no where near the EPA estimated miles per gallon, which is dismal anyway.",Looks good.,Fuel economy.

I was upgrading to a 4 door and was looking for a family adventure vehicle with lots of space and the ability to get our gear in to the mountains. I drove the Crewmax Limited and bought it on the spot. The engine and transmission are powerful and silky smooth. The TRD package has everything you need to feel secure off road. The seating is extremely comfortable which was a major selling point and the cabin is almost dead quiet.This is a serious truck without a bone jaring truck feel.

Well the new design rocks.  It definitely drives more like a full size truck, similar to F-150 or Silverado.  The power is awesome, fantastic for towing, and has a great big bed with optional tie downs.  Build quality is excellent, as you would expect, and I have had zero issues, not even a rattle in 10k miles.

Interior quality seems better than previous models and offers a quiet ride.  The ride has impressed even my wife, and she loves to drive it. The power is noticeable and I am sure it will tow the boat effortlessly. 15 mpg in burbs, but should improve with break in.

It is so much fun to drive that I'm looking for reasons to go out! I bought a 2007 SR5 SB in Nov 07 and while it was OK, I really wanted the LB version without the Off-Road package. So I sold the SB with only 1389 miles and bought the SR5 LB and couldn't be happier. It rides smooth, has unbelieveable power, and gets decent mileage. I have installed a back-up camera, fog lights, self-dimming mirror, in-channel visors, sill protectors, duals and bed extender all OEM and the great thing is that it was already prewired for all the electrical installations. I love this!","Ride comfort, well equipped, options easy to install because truck is prewired, looks great, well thought out by Toyota, frame is beefy and durable, exhaust is stainless steel, engine is smooth amd powerful.","Extend warranty to match GM etc. The Tundra is a better truck ,so match or better their warranty."
4.625,Just an Awesome Truck,J-Peg ,02/21/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,3,5,I went from a 2004 Ford F-150 to the Tundra and what an improvement.  This truck has some guts.  The 5.7L will put back in your seat.  It is fun to drive and I love how high I sit off the road (I have the TRD package).  I'm in love with my truck!,"5.7 engine, 6 spd tranny, traction control, interior design.","Only knock I have is the fuel gauge is highly inaccurate. After filling up, I'll drive 30 miles and it will be just above quarter of a tank. When the gas light comes on and is on E, I still have 5-6 gallons in the truck.  There is no reason Toyota can come up with a more accurate fuel gauge."
4.875,"High Quality, High Performance Truck",GregS96 ,02/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Leased this vehicle in Nov, 2007. 4,800 miles as of Feb, 2008. Former owner of a 2005 Dodge Ram Powerwagon.  The Tundra Limited equipped with the off road package and navigation system is far superior in every respect, except dedicated offroading (no stock truck beats the Powerwagon for that).  The Tundra is a large vehicle, but the parking sonar, rear view camera and outstanding turning radius makes it relatively easy to park and maneuver. Road manners are outstanding with performance car-like acceleration and passing capability. Back seat leg room is the best in its class. If it wasn't for its truck-like gas mileage (14.5 mpg average so far),  it could easily pass for a daily driver.","Quality, performance, utility, technology, comfort, style. Front/rear parking sonar, navigation/back-up camera/bluetooth phone system. This vehicle convinced me to trade in my '04 Mercedes Benz 4matic for an '08 Lexus GS350awd.  ",Substandard tires (Goodyear Rugged Trail). Replaced with Goodyear Silent Armors (terrific).  Poor sat. radio antenna location (beneath windshield registration decals) with substandard reception. Optional remote start is temperamental. Wish gas mileage could be improved without sacrificing performance.
4.75,Should have bought limited!!,First Truck ,02/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I have always wanted a truck and when I was finally 'allowed', I traded my Lexus LS430 and Ford Explorer.  I am so happy with my decision.  I have already upgraded with a truxedo cover, upgraded homelink mirror, running boards, and backup mirror.   I have been buying a lot of my parts.  Maybe I should have paid an 5k for the limited?  Who cares?  This truck fits me so well and is a joy to drive.  I am excited everytime I go into the garage (which by the way, I had to clean out to the back wall to fit this monster in!).  My only concern is driving through the parking garage in Philly and wondering if the top will scrape! ","Overall design, comfort, power, sturdiness, reliability",None yet!
4.875,Love this Truck!,Will ,02/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is the best truck in its class! For 3 months I researched, test-drove, and priced everything in its class and came away knowing that the new Tundra was the best choice.  The powerful engine, smooth transmission, cavernous interior, and quiet ride puts this truck in a class of its own.  With the 6-speed my Tundra gets better mileage than a friend's '07 5.4L F150.","5.7L engine. Moonroof, sliding rear window, bluetooth, and JBL audio system.",Optitron gauges in SR5 trim. Power down AND up on ALL windows. TRD Performance package with TRD Supercharger.
4.5,Rough Rider,Dave ,02/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,3,4,4,"This is a great truck in every way - except the rough ride. I love the accessories and the 5.7 liter engine. The six speed transmission is very versatile. The 4X4 works great in heavy snow and on ice. The ride, however, is bone jarring and very uncomfortable on anything except a smooth asphalt hiway. It feels like it needs about 2000 lbs. of load in the back to calm the jerky ride. I strongly recommend that if you have neck or back problems, look elsewhere. Fuel economy is not great but is what I expected - about 15 mpg average for all driving conditions. Brakes are excellent, leather seats also. ","5.7 liter engine has loads of power. Interior is excellent. Good sound system, navigation system is great. Tons of leg room front and back. Very good towing capacity and handling. Turning radius is incredibly small for a big truck so it is easy to park.","Do something about the rough ride! Fix the gas gauge, which reads empty with six gallons in the tank. Sonar back up warning goes off six feet from an obstacle so it's not much help."
4.875,A Work Truck AND an Luxury Car ,Steve H ,02/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"For the person who needs a 'Luxury Car' but WANTS A TRUCK- I would suggest looking into the Tundra X-SP Package.  The leather seats and carbon fiber accents throughout the dashboard and arm rests make this truck luxurious and sporty.  The BBS wheels and 305/50R 20 Michellins give this truck the perfect look, stance, and a ride that rivals any luxury car I have ever ridden in.  The backseat of the double cab is roomy enough for someone who is 6'2"" to sit comfortably behind someone 6'2"" in the driver's seat.  And the truck handles like a DREAM!  I have driven F150s, RAMs, and Titans and this truck out accelerates and handles all of them.  I LOVE MY TRUCK!",The X-SP Package married with the interior and exterior design.,The ONLY negative is the fuel economy...those 381 horses drink A LOT!  
5,A Quality Truck At Last,TONYS ,01/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Most comfortable, useable vehicle of the more than 100 I have owned. Great power and road presence with mpg that is very good considering weight to get 19-20 mpg with reasonable, adult driving. Spacious interior and level of comfort make it ideal for long road trips. This is the 36th truck I have owned and it gets rated #1 for the reasons above, plus, it just FEELS right, like I am more at ease in going from point A to point B. Highly recommend for any purpose, but especially for long trips and hauling heavy loads. A winner!","Comfort, ease of driving, in command seating, feeling of safety",An easy step of some kind to get into the bed easier. A larger capacity gas tank.
4.625,Couldn't be happier,Jenkins ,01/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"If you're looking for a big, fast pickup, get this truck!! 5.7 can't be beat, except in MPG, but who buys a truck for mileage.  Super roomy, and I'm 6' 200, friends are all bigger than me and we all spread out when I'm driving.  Only way I'd be happier is in a $100k luxury sedan, and I'm not rich, so this truck definitely has it all for the working man! Top ends are nice, but way too much for not that much.  Grade model has everything you need, unless you can't read a map and don't know how to back up!","Engine, comfort, interior controls are super easy, turning radius great for size, great features for base model, don't waste money on top end unless you can't stand not having the show-off badging.  ","Gas gauge is not accurate, told me I was below 1/4 tank and at fillup I had 11 gallons left.  And, needs meatier sounding exhaust for such a mean engine.  Sounds like a sedan, but sure doesn't drive like one!"
4.875,Toyota Gets It Right,1972ck ,01/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This will be Tundra #3 for me.  While I enjoyed my last Tundras this one is by far the most capable. Excellent acceleration, braking. Can't wait to hook it up to my travel trailer and see how she tows! Like the comfort and conv. items in the interior. Turning radius is awesome! Special ordered mine took a bit to get but worth the wait. If you're in the market for a full sized p/u, you've got to give the all new Tundra a look. I drove the others and found the Tundra to be superior.  The Dodge was cheap looking int., the Ford rode terribly. The Chevy was a close second but reliability scared me away.  The Titan is a joke, no payload. ","Tight turning radius, excellent braking, love the tailgate. Traction, stability control, ABS and limited slip diff. standard equipment. Acceleration is to die for.",Rear visibility can be difficult in some situations. 
4.875,What a great truck,JerSr ,01/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,This vehicle drives very well for a large truck and has a good deal of storage in the rear seat area.

4.875,Great Truck!,David ,01/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This truck performs great! It drives through the snow with ease, I have only had to use the 4-wheel drive a couple of times. It is such a great ride. When we go somewhere it's a fight about whose vehicle we are going to take. (I usually win.)","I really love the interior! The leather is so soft, and there is so much leg room. The heated seats are definatly a bonus!",I wish the navigation would display the radio stations constantly.

5,The winner after months of comparing,D Boone ,01/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After looking at trucks for the entire fall, I settled on the Tundra.  The big three have priced themselves out of range for a HD truck to me.  Now with the HP and torque the 5.7 has the Tundra does outperform the others.  This trim line has everything I need to use it as a work truck,  so I saved quite a bit over the SR5 pkg. ","5.7 engine, 6-spd tranny, power everything. Towing mirrors.

4.875,Better every day,2whl ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love this truck - and the more I drive it the more I like it. The nav system is great. Bluetooth for cell phone is nice. Powertrain is amazing - smooth and strong. My kids love the back seat room. Get a tube step, its a big step up without one if you're less than 6ft. MPG is poor & getting worse(13-14 mixed driving), & my friends DC 4x2 5.7 is beating me by 4mpg, which is a big mpg hit for the CM 4x4. Reading dash gauges is like looking at them thru a tube-these could be better. Gas gauge is VERY pessimistic, says I'm empty when I still have 5 gal. Reflection of clock on windshield at night. I get lots of positive comments on the truck. I don't miss my F250 Crew diesel at all.","Great powertrain. Nav system works very well & has lots of extra info available in it. Bluetooth is nice to have for cellular. Lots of storage. I like the look - some don't care for it, I like that it is different.","Needs one-push window for up AND down, not just down. Needs a mute button on steering wheel w/ audio controls. Mileage is poor, you pay the price for the performance you get with this truck. Would be nice if the nav system would play a DVD movie.

Though I've only had this Tundra for two weeks, I have to say that it far exceeds all expectations I ever had for a vehicle, much less a truck.  Where has this truck been my whole life???

4.75,Good truck,Tom ,01/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I just traded in my 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe to buy a new 2008 Toyota Tundra.  So far I love everything about the tundra.  I was concerned about poor gas mileage, but that is not the case.  The 5.7 L can actually get better gas mileage because it is a 6 speed.  It all depends on how you drive it.  The ONLY complaint I have about the Tundra is that the ride is a little bit rough.  I think that the everything else about the Tundra is so nice though that it easily makes up for the rough ride.","Interior/exterior design. 5.7 L 6 spd engine.

Test drove the others then came back to Toyota as usual. The 2008 Tundra had cloth seats, single CD player, manual adjust seats and didn't come with floor mats. I bought the Tundra hands down (and it wasn't that much cheaper). Unfortunately I'll have to wait for another 12 or so years to get a new truck... they're built that good.","Appearance and power. This beast is a work horse. Plus, the ride is really nice.","OK Toyota, listen up. This isn't your typical truck. It's a tool made for towing and hauling, yet confortable enough for a night out.

If you need to get past slower traffic, just put your foot down and very easily and safely accelerate past. Breaking on this truck is phenominal, it stops extremely rapidly and safely. Extremely good all round truck for hauling people and a bed full of materials. Have not used it yet for towing, but should be a winner.","Appearance, so many other trucks are made from the same mold.
