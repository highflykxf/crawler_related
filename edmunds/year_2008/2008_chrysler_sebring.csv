5,Truly a CLASSIC,Doug ,09/18/2016,5,5,5,,,5,4,4,4,,,The 2008 Limited Hardtop convertible is a classic. It is fun to drive and has plenty of performance. I would like to add that the performance and handling of the Sebring improved greatly when we installed a set of General Altimax RT43 tires. The previous tires made the car harsh riding and were very noisy. The difference was amazing! We get great mileage on the road 27 to 28 mpg. We live in the country so almost all our driving miles are on 60 mph roads. With the windscreen up the car is quieter with the side windows down. I have had many convertibles including a 1958 Morris Minor and the Sebring is by far the best.,,

The only problems have been the radio (replaced twice) and the turn signal assembly had to be replaced.

I love the styling, and I still have people come up to me in parking lots to comment on how beautiful the color is (glacier blue).

With 5-Star crash ratings, stability control and side airbags, you can't buy a safer car! Handling in winter conditions was fantastic, the front wheel drive and stability control performed great. We also like the LIFETIME WARRANTY on the powertrain and plan to keep this car for ten years or more, what a fantastic value! Do yourself a favor and drive the Sebring and compare it to similar cars and I will be surprised if you don't buy the Sebring.","Many compliments on the exterior styling, roomy interior with simple controls.

I've done about 10,000 miles and my wife has done about 6,000 miles on hers.  We love the way they drive, their fuel economy, their styling and their huge trunk capacity.  On a recent long trip, my car with four people in it, plus luggage,with the top down averaged over 31 mpg doing parkway speeds!  My wife's car with the six, regularly does 25+ mpg.

Our car is a blast to drive and the appearance is classy and looks much more expensive than it was. We get comments on it everytime we are out. The gas mileage is much improved on my last vehicle and did I say it is a blast to drive?  I can get a huge Sam's run worth of groceries in the trunk when the top is up and an adequate amount with it down.  My husband likes to stretch way out to drive and at 6'2"" he has no complaints.",My favorite things about this car are 1. It's a blast 2. One button touch to automatically open or close both the windows and top 3. The appearance-inside and out 4. The get-up-and-go for big city interstate on-ramps ,My only suggestion is that if you want to fit in 4 adults the car gets a little crowded by moving the front seats forward. If the seats could be downsized a little while still keeping the comfort it would be a great car for 4 adults.  A family with smaller children would fit fine.
3.5,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,Why Me?? ,07/10/2009,,,5,5,2,2,,2,3,5,4,"This was by far the worst mistake I have ever made when purchasing a car. (Owned Toyota, Pontiac, Lexus, and Audi.) In the first 20 days of driving my Chrysler Sebring LX Convertible the latch on the trunk stops operating. This means that my trunk lid will not close and is unsafely moving about while I drive. Next problem came at a stop light when the car stalledYes, I was completely stopped at a light and it completely shut off. Luckily my boyfriend was driving and he of course knew what to do. I probably would have panicked. Third, it seems that this problem is a continual problem that CHRYSLER (who should be bankrupt from making crappy cars) is in denial to recall to fix.

Issues include, brake lights coming on intermittently, starting getting stuck, front- end/steering noise, stuck door locks, stalling, recalls and interior fit issues. I am currently working with Chrysler assistance to get rid of this vehicle as I feel the front-end problems make it unsafe to drive. Also, it is not worth now what is owed according to KBB.

Here's some comparisons: - '08 model rides higher, which is nice. - '01 model had a notably bigger cabin - both the front seats and (especially) the rear seats. That said, the 08 is still a comfortable, smooth ride. - The V6 engine in my 01 Sebring had much better accleration. The '08 2.7- liter V6 is adequate, but the difference in power is palpable. - The 08 model has tighter handling and a better turning radius. On balance, the 08 Touring model is a tremendous value.

I think it is made poorly and within the first month I noticed a rock had hit the underside of the tire casing and made a notch in the paint. After closer inspection I noticed that there is another part where the paint is pulling away where the metal body and plastic bumper of the car meet.

Could not be driven.  Had to put it on a flatbed and have it towed.  Ugh!  2 months later, the exact same thing happened.  Had to get it towed again, in the rain!  Since then, I have had two recalls on the relay switch for the same problem.  While I love the way the car looks, I would NEVER recommend anyone to purchase.  During this past year while having the car, I have never been able to really enjoy the vehicle, since every time I put the top down, I close my eyes and have to pray that it doesn't get stuck again.  Also, does a lot of sputtering.  Never could find the problem.",Exterior,

Good sound from the standard radio and Sirius radio is a plus. My mileage averages between 31 and 32 for all around driving.

In the first three months I was without a radio for at least two months. It came on when it felt like it. I was promised a software up grade each month. It never came! Finally it got here. They put it in and radio was worse. The installed a new radio. It wasn't new it was a refurbished. What a laugh. It was worse then the first on plus the switched hard drive capacity.  It still didn't work. The bluetooth locked up with the phones and your party could not hear you. The put in another refurbished unit and it again was junk. Now have a new unit from a demo car and it's junk","Trying hard to get the junk radio to work! I can not believe that Chrysler would put up with a vendor that put out such crap!

4.875,Love the Sebring Hardtop Convertible,Sam ,05/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The car handles the roads well and highway driving is like riding in a low-flying airplane.  The ride is incredibly smooth with very little road noise. The feel of the car is very solid; not like a typical convertible.  Ive negotiated corners much faster than usual and found that it corners like most other cars that Ive experienced.  The dash and instrument panel is well appointed. The 3.5 is great and the extra power helps handle all kinds of traffic situations.  Top goes up & down 3 times a day, no problems.  Washing is a breeze; I use the drive-thru carwash & have no water problems whatsoever.  Test drive this car and I think you will be hooked.  This car is a beauty; I love it!

It's great to know that you can get a car with such good mpg in a package that doesn't look or feel like an economy car.  I'm averaging over 30 mpg (about 80% hwy) without crawling along the freeway. The Chevy Malibu gets a lot of press, as do the Japanese competition.  But for the money, I think the Sebring is underrated, and overlooked. The Limited or Touring with Leather is the way to go.  Definitely adds a feeling of luxury, without breaking the bank.  Don't be afraid to stick with the 4cyl.

Living in FL has many advantages and one is that i get to commute with the top down most of the time.  I looked at many cars including a Prius for this commute, but am very glad i choose the Sebring as this is the most fun to drive car i tried.  With the mygig in the car all my play lists are loaded and at the ready as i head over the Sunshine Skyway with the top down.  Mileage has been a bit better than listed at about 30 mpg, the highway gear helps, and it's nice to have the bigger engine when you need it.","New styling, MyGig, Solid car that is not only safe, but feels safe.

4.125,Some flaws but over good car,DrinkingStar ,02/23/2008,,,3,4,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"I've driven my car for about 1000 miles. The precision of the steering, the brakes and the standard audio system are the best of any car I've owned. It gets 24-26 mpg & I have gotten 28.3 mpg  mainly hwy with some city driving. Acceleration is decent but seems to be slower than it really is because of the smooth ride. Even though the cabin space is bigger than my '97 Sebring ragtop, there is less front & almost no rear legroom compared to the '97. The fit & finish of the interior & the materials make the car look retro-futuristic. As for the design, it is comparable to the Japanese cars. The ride is as good as an Acura or Scion and the interior & trunk space are better than the VW Eos. ","The ride is very quiet and very smooth. Road handling is excellent in foul weather, steering is precise and brakes are fantastic. I love the hardtop & the amount of trunk space. The standard radio/CD system is fantastic. For the size of the engine and the weight of the car, gas mileage is very good.",Roof gutters to channel rain runoff. Increase rear seat legroom & cabin storage space.

4.375,Surprised,ed ,02/16/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"I have a Touring Sedan 2.7, a car generally cross-shopped by consumers looking in the 4cyl Accord/Camry price range.  Edmunds leaves this model out of the pull down menu.  This car is what I have long appreciated in my Hondas; the ""we make it simple"" principle. As an example, compare the Sebring's three knob HVAC controls to the mess of buttons that now plagues the Accord.  The Sebring has an ultra rigid body and the touring suspension has the travel and damping required to navigate America's deteriorating roads. The 2.7 touring model is a very capable driver too.  The seating position is excellent and support good posture. Boston sound is superb and when it is off, the interior is silent.","My Gig, 18"" optional wheels.

With the hard top, when it rains, the water tends to flow along the edge of the seam by the front part of the roof and off the sides. So when you open the door you will get wet. Not a big deal for me but I could see other people having an issue with it. It requires two hands to put the seat back. This is stange...you have to lift the level with one hand and push the seat back with the other. The spot between the windsheild and hood tends to collect leaves in the fall.

It is a cruiser, not a  sportscar . Comfortable, quiet, and classy! Ride quality is great. All the professional reviews do not give this car justice. I am really glad I got the electronic stabilty control as  we live in the snow and it really makes winter driving safer and easier. This is our everyday car in Minnesota winters.

","The engine and drive train are my favorite features. Lots of power, excellent handling and overall, a much more state of the art system. I also like the styling of the new Sebring - very 'wedgy' and somewhat aggressive.  ","The inside looks like a plastic factory - plastic everywhere.

LED dash is great at night. Higher and deeper fron seats are very nice. Base interior is better than many. Handling is good for a base car.,"Reduced rear seat leg room is a big negative.
