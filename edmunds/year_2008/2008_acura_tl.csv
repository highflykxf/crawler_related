5,My Dream Car,Meech ,10/05/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,4,,,I always wanted this car since high school. I made my dream come true found a 2008 with under 70 K.To most people this is a downgrade  from my previous car but to me it was a upgrade. This is a car I will drive until the wheels fall off . I cannot wait until I put my supercharger inside of it.,,

4,A few gremlins to prepare for.....,first used acura for me ,08/20/2015,4,5,5,,,4,4,4,4,,,"Nice sized city car with ample power, high quality interior and attractive looks.  Relatively quiet and comfortable.  Bought used from Acura w/ 64k miles.  Subsequent repairs/replacement that are endemic to this car as you'll learn on the internet.  Purge value in the evap system, easy fix.  O-rings on the hydraulic steering system (loud sound on cold mornings that goes away as engine warms, an easy fix).  Hydraulic shocks/struts for the hood, easy fix.  O2 sensors, a bit trickier fix.  Check Youtube for demos on replacing these items and save big, big bucks over expensive Acura dealers.  The nav system is not intuitive and if it has the original DVD, you'll pay like $170 for an upgrade that is, unfortunately, probably worth it.  The upgrade has all U.S. major roads and city streets.  The original only had 72 cities and was filled with irrelevant stuff like reviews of restaurants.  Big diff.  Do not tint the rear window or the nav won't be accurate............as it isn't in mine.  Grrrr.   Car holds value well, it appears, and I think that is because it is one of the best looking of the TL series plus Honda's reliability record which is best with their 4 cylinder jobs, not six cylinders.  Mostly satisfied but would be happier if some of the components were more durable and the Acura dealers only charged an arm instead of an arm and a leg.",,
5,Excellent car all around,Icu Nursing ,05/07/2015,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This car was an amazing buy. I couldn't have asked for anything more. It has just the right amount of luxury and sport. I drove my brother's TL for a month and absolutely fell in love with the Acura. The TL was perfect in everything besides for the power (preference). So I bought the type-s. If you plan to commute this car gets 33 mpg on freeway at 70mph when I'm not driving it hard. When you want to have fun it will take on most cars on the road (auto). If I planned to constantly race I would have looked for a manual which has much better drag performance (6speed). When I see other type-s owners on the road my eyes enjoy this vehicle's unmatched unique design.,Acura really took all their focus and effort into the Acura TL (S). The design is unbeatable up to date. The front wheel drive allows it to get very good gas mileage. Brembos help me slow down from 120 like nothing. Exhaust sounds very nice when I floor it. Car is very spacious. MUCH more comfortable than any other car. Reliability is Acura's number one priority.,Bring the type-s BACK!!!
4.75,A great used choice,edechazal ,12/21/2012,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I purchased a clean 2008 TL auto with navigation 6 weeks ago.It's a wonderful car.I'm a ""car guy"" but no longer a boy-racer since I'm in my 40's.I appreciate refinement and pieces that work well together.This car delivers in most areas.The first test drive sold me on the car's feel and driving dynamics.I'm 5' 11"" and the car fits me like a glove.I like the view from the driver's seat, the powertrain's responsiveness and the look of the tan leather interior.I also test drove the redesigned 2009 model and definitely prefer the 2008 since it fits better.Piece of advice:be ready to spring for a new set of Michelins when you buy.Fresh tires clean up lots of problems.","The engine and transmission are fabulous.
They work very well together and give you the closest thing to the sports car experience you will get this side of a manual transmission.
The engine sound is great, even at idle.
A slight engine growl comes up through the steering wheel letting you know the car is ready to take on the road.
Shifts are very smooth and immediate unlike many other cars that seem to lag.
I rarely feel any torque steer and feel this criticism is unjustified.
In fact, the front drive system is an asset in Michigan since it will do better in snow.


The sound system is as good everybody says.
The switchgear is nice and quality is evident throughout.","There are only 2 areas preventing this car from being perfect in my book:
The Bluetooth system and the ride quality. 

The Bluetooth system is a bit clumsy with my phone.
You have to realize there are 2 phonebooks, one that is your phone download and one that resides in the car itself.
Your ability to voice dial depends on where exactly your contact resides.
The manual is not clear in this area.


The ride is a bit harsh in my view.
You get used to it but when I drive another car, I find myself relaxing a bit more.
The TL's ride is the price you pay for razor sharp handling and a great connected feel to the road.
Test drive the car before you buy."

Other than that, the interior is in excellent condition. I do a lot of highway driving and will normally get around 30-31 MPG if the speed control is used and stays around 65-70.

Since that time, it is very difficult to steer, especially when turning corners or backing out of parking spaces & the acceleration is disappointing.

I really like the beautiful styling touches such as the character lines that run across the sides of the car. The 2008 TL styling is elegant and understated, unlike the new 2009 TL which I thought is too loud for my taste with the oversized grill in the front and chrome strip on the trunk.  However, the sleek styling does result in poor rearward visibility for the TL. Having driven a Acura Integra for the last 20 years, this is probably the biggest thing I have to adopt in my new TL. Both the B and the C pillars on the TL are very wide!",Italian styling with Japanese dependability! Excellent touch-screen navigation and typical logical Honda control layout.,So so material inside. My dash blotches easily (using 409 spray has helped a lot). Leather on the seating area could be a bit better quality. Some rattle near the front passenger window.

I shopped the G35, Lexus IS350 and BMW 3 Series before buying the Acura.   The nice part about the car is the value for the money, this car comes loaded.  With Lexus, BMW and Infiniti the options are expensive and add up quickly.  An IS350 with the same equipment as this car stickered at over $45k, same with BMW.   I was able to purchase my TL-S for $33k, that was $5,800 off the sticker.

The TL is a well-built auto with nice interior design and complementary touches.  It's a bit light, and coupled with the regular skinny tires, provides a harsh, shaky ride over rough pavement.  Go for the better tires.  I don't agree completely with the car being described as having sporty handling, especially as a front-driver, as it pushes through the turns.  But it does have good acceleration to get you safely on the highway, but at a cost in fuel economy (averaging 23 mpg overall).

Looked at a 09 Accord V6, but the layout and features of this 08 were much better.  The styling of the 09 seems a little off to me, plus the price was much higher.  The 08 is much more conservative, but classy.  Happy with my purchase and would recommend - I don't have the rattles that some talk about although it takes some getting used to how the engine seems to brake when you let your foot off the gas instead of coasting like most cars do...","Nice radio, handles very well, good layout of controls...","Larger fuel tank, fold down back seat instead of just a small pass through, more low end torque..."
4.875,Stayed with the Honda family of cars,Mike ,03/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,It came down to this car or a BMW 3-Series and I'm glad I chose the Acura.  It has excellent performance and handles well.  Interior features are great and the body style is sleek. Previously owned a Civic so I know this car is dependable.,"Controls on the steering wheel, nav system, interior design, body, multi-speaker surround sound system with subwoofer","Ipod interface (I know it's in the 09 model), the panel over the center speaker rattles sometimes"
4.875,all that,Eric ,03/14/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,We just bought our TL and have come to love it! The performance and handling are just right for my driving habits (however bad they may be). Hopefully mister officer won't be around when I let her ponies run. The interior is pretty comfortable and well designed. We look forward to many years with this car.,"Love the gadgets. bluetooth, xm, and voice recognition. Also love the warranty.","Agree with a previous post about the air temp, trip, etc., not being placed in the right spots."
4.875,Break it In,!AHA! ,03/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"When I first got my Type-S, I was disappointed: the transmission felt jerky, the tires squealed readily during cornering and hard acceleration, and to top it off I bought an AUTO, which was all they had left.  About three months later, the car literally transformed: the transmission was silky smooth, the handling was snappy and nimble, and there wasn't any real torque steer or understeer to deal with.  It was still an auto, but that went well with the enormous number of luxury features.  I can cruise in comfort and in style, or I can rip through the woods and destroy a Mitsubishi Eclipse at a stoplight. Either way, I'm no longer disappointed.  ","Speed, handling, ideal balance of sportiness and comfort.  The six-disc in-dash surround sound DVD audio system rocks.  The touchscreen navigation is far more user friendly than the ""luxury knobs.""  Back-up camera, tilting rearview mirrors, Bluetooth connectivity, and voice-command are great.",Acura needs to produce more manual transmissions. 
4.75,Graduating through the Honda line,john ,01/26/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought my first civic in 85 and have owned a prelude, odessey and had been driving a 98 Accord with 172K miles. I thought it was time to continue with my Honda loyalty until they give me a reason not to, so I stepped up in class and bought the 08 TL in October.  After 4 months, I have been very happy with this car. It looks plain from the outside, but is loaded with features. I would recommend it to anyone who wants high- performance, luxury and value.  ","It has a lot of high end features that I have come to appreciate: the voice recognition Hands-free link, dual climate control, dual driver setting memory. I am listening to music from the 80s on the cassette player. It is smooth, powerful and  fun to drive especially in the manual shift mode","I have beefs that are frustrating because my accord had them. The gas mileage isn't good - about 23 mpg. There is no drawer for change, I hate messing with the coin holder. No sunglass holder, in the ceiling. Trunk release should be on the same lever as the gas. It needs gas cap holder on the lid"
5,The Best Car I've Ever Driven,Aristides ,01/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This vehicle is the best value for the money out there. There are no options, enhancements or suggestions that I could make to improve this vehicle. The interior and exterior design is superior and unfortunately, not matched by their 2009 TL entry. No problems whatsoever at 12,500 miles to date.",The entire car package,None
3.125,Problems with Acura,sjb7 ,01/17/2009,,,4,4,1,1,,3,4,3,5,I purchased a new (25 miles on it) 2008 Acura TL in early December.  After driving the car for two weeks and 2000 miles the cam shaft seized and required 20 days of repair time. Understanding that this is not common at all I asked Acura for a replacement and they tried to get me to agree to an extended warranty and to wash their hands of liability.  Acura has been terrible to work with and this is my first and last Acura solely because of how I have been treated.   If you are in the market for a new car please consider all your options and keep in mind that Acura will not help you if you are sold a car with problems. ,We love the looks of our Acura.,Acura needs to consider customer service and appreciation.  They do not care about you after you buy a car from them.
4.875,Love the TL,Daniel ,01/08/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I drove a 2005 Honda Accord V6 before the TL and was so happy with the performance and reliability that I had to stay in the Honda family.  There was a little buyers remorse b/c I didn't feel comfortable spending this amount of money on a car but I can honestly say I am very happy with the 08 TL.  This car rides smooth and I love the interior. The navigation is wonderful with all its capabilities and voice recognition works pretty well.  And, best of all the resell value is great for these cars.  If I have one complaint it would be the rattles from the interior... they come and go as they please. But, I can deal with it if this is all I am unhappy about. ",,
4.625,Hard to beat,Mark in Tulsa ,01/05/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,5,4,"The car is hard to beat.  I compared it with a wide variety of cars, the Jetta, BMW 328i, Lexus RX330, Infiniti G35, and Honda Accord.  I kept coming back to this one as the standard.  It met all my expectations and the value is definitely there.  It's not the most exciting car, but it's very handsome, and it suits my driving style just fine.  The ride is nice, I love the nav and reverse camera, and the interior is gorgeous.  I think there are a few problems with rattles, but other than that, it's hard to find fault.",I highly recommend getting the navigation.  It completely changes the character of the car.  I also like the fit and finish quality of the interior.,"I don't like the way the trip odo, trip computer, tire pressure gauge, outside temp, etc. are all combined into one display, so you have to thumb thru the menus to get to whatever you want to see.  I think outside temperature needs a permanent display.  Also, there are more rattles than I expected."
4.75,Glad I did not wait for 2009 TL,Blah Blah ,01/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,Love the car!  Midnight Black with dark interior and 6-speed. This card flies and is a blast to drive.  Love the standard gadgets.  This makes the buying experience very easy.  ,"Sound/nav functionality, performance, interior design/layout.","18"" wheels standard, More robust rear spoiler or loose it.

4.875,2008 TL w/ Navi,JerseyGal ,12/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've had the car for about 2 months now and so far so good. Overall, I'm very impressed. The ride is smooth, it handles curves well, and the tech package is extremely fun. I am having a problem getting my garage door opener connected to the rear view mirror. Additionally, the moment it gets cold my tire pressure lights come on.","Bluetooth, heated seats, back up camera, space, moon roof.","Fuel efficiency, it would be nice if the side mirrors automatically folded in, placement of the navi screen on the dash board."
4.75,Great car. Worth every buck,Sid ,12/02/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought this car in Sep '08 and I love this car. It is worth every buck for all the features that come standard with the car. Gas mileage is great for a 3.2L V6. I get 33 mpg highway and 19-24 mpg city. The sound system is really good. Interiors are well crafted. The only con would be slight rattle at low speeds, but no biggie, I can live with it for everything else it offers.   ","Voice recognition, sound system, interiors, and comfortable ride.",Slight rattles inside the car.
4.875,2008 TL-S First Impressions,JVC ,11/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased a 2008 TL-S in late October. I was looking for a sporty design with a smart interior. The TL-S also had more room than my 2007 BMW 328xi. I have owned the Infinity 235 and find that its interior does not match up to the TL-S. I love the wheels, the ELS sound system and the whole exterior look. I know it may be tired but it is classic. I looked at the 2009 but was not impressed by the design. I also received a great deal on the year end model.  I traded-in a 2007 Saab Convertible. Acura makes buying very easy because there are only two trim levels. The competitors make you pay for every feature.","Sound system, exterior styling, great ride, interior quality. Price, car comes with everything from a features standpoint","18"" rims as standard. Head light washers and rain sensitive windshield washers"
4.875,"Value, Value, Value",Scott ,11/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I had an 2004, sold it and bought a 2008 after testing the 2009 TL which I liked but could not justify the $9,000 price difference.  The 08 feels more sure footed and grippy compared to the 04 and their are better ergonomics inside.  ",Like the interior lighting.  ELS surround sound. Drive by wire acceleration.  Simple controls.,Would like some split fold rear seats.  Better all season tires.
4.875,Quiet Confidence/ Lovin every minute!!,Dookie ,11/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Traded 94 Legend for the Carbon Bronze 2008 TL/S. The TL/S same or better features than Niss/BMW for less $$.  The 3.5 gets the TL/S moving quickly & oversize brakes offer smooth braking. Cruising at 70mph is the norm as one doesn't recognize the ""speed"" so pay attention. Quiet cabin, heated seats/mirrors, nav, XM, reverse cam, CD, DVD, smooth yet firm ride, great acceleration, takes curves like a slot-car.  Speeds > 100mph, smooth & silky w/no vibration. Driving this auto since 12/2007, its once again FUN TO DRIVE! Absolutely love it!","What comes standard in TL/S comes as extra in BMW and G35.  Smooth/quiet ride, nice acceleration, impressive handling, overtaking other autos with plenty of power to spare. With this automobile one KNOWS the 3.5 will deliver.  Plenty of trunk space, roomy interior.  Did I say acceleration!!!","Stereo sound is a bit fuzzy and takes some getting accustomed too.  Would prefer 18 inch wheels as standard.  Toss the rear-deck lid ""spoiler"" as it appears an after-thought and doesn't compliment the ""line.""  Toss the seat-belt non-use reminder.  Steering radius is a little ""long in the tooth."""
4.875,What more could I ask for,SirJames ,11/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,This is my fourth TL and I could not be more pleased. I considered the 2009 TL but was not wild about the preview pics and the associated styling (the cost of an end of year vehicle were sweet!). The comments from others are ALWAYS great. The interior and exterior styling as as expected: nice. The mileage is not exceptional but very acceptable.,I greatly enjoy the navigation system. I resisted with my other TLs and now regret that I did not make the plunge. The audio based commands for audio are spot on. The handling is very nice. Bluetooth and the availability of a cassette player still cause me joy.,"If there could be more integration of any and not just iPod mp3 player controls, I would be pleased."
5,Perfect car,Average comsumer ,10/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Actually the TL is my wifes car but I can tell when she is in love. For her, it is just the right size, has just the right equipment, has just the right amount of power, and behaves/feels like it is part of her. It is a nice looking car without being too flashy.",To whole package is well thought out. Very surprised with mileage 33- 35HWY/25-28 City. Higher than expected but other reviews might have been Type S cars. This non-navigation car has very simple controls so everything is easy to find.,None that are not just personal preferences. Hope the new model keeps same goals.

I wanted the Nighthawk Black Pearl, but ended up with Kinetic Blue Pearl with the dark Type S wheels. I love the way it looks and especially the way it drives!

5,Love this car!,Mike ,10/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Evaluated vs. the 2009 Audi A4 and G35xs. This car isn't as sporty as the G35 but more than the A4. It isn't as luxurious as the A4 but more than the G35. Perfect for my less than 20 mile commute. Gas mileage better than advertised. Extremely comfortable seats. Plenty of room for 6' plus. GPS easy to use. Voice commands a little hard to get used too. Excellent handling in the rain, up hills. Great acceleration. Plenty of backseat space.

5,What a value,Tim ,08/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We could not be happier with our purchase. Plenty of power, very comfortable seats, awesome sound system. 30 mpg on a recent trip, 22-25 overall. After purchasing an 07 Civic, my wife was impressed with Honda. She traded her beloved SUV.

4.625,"Versatile, attitude, hi mileage(?) ",bbence ,08/25/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,5,5,"The car performs at your pleasure: it can give you speed, power, comfort, great directions (w/ navi), decent handling, and amazing mileage.  Even with a few moments of pedal to the medal, I have been averaging between 31 and 32 mpg, albeit mostly highway miles.  Front end torque is minimal unless you accelerate while making a sharp turn.  The 6-speed is very smooth, energizing, and lets you drive the car the way it should be.   ",6-sp manual; mileage when going to church; black color; great response when you need power to pass; classy look; the best navigation in the business.,"Improve the bluetooth; all-wheel drive option; free XM radio for 1 year; add a few inches to the trunk to more easily accommodate golf clubs; change to chrome wheels for the type-S; add a 7th gear for cruising (current the 6th gear of type-S is over 2,000 rpm at 60 mph)."
4.375,08 Acura TL-S,Rob ,08/07/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,4,4,5,"I was leaning toward the base TL with Navi, but after test-driving both the base TL and the S it was all over.  I drove the S first and the base TL really lacked the torque off the line.  This is a great commuter car, comfortable yet sporty.  I have the Crystal White Pearl with the Ebony/Silver Interior.  I get compliments on the exterior color with its iridescence.  I have about 900 miles on it now and the trip computer is telling me that for the past 650 miles (reset this after the initial tank of gas from the dealer) my MPG are 26!  My commute is mixed city/highway (Philadelphia to NW Suburbs, 27 miles one-way).","Traffic monitor saves me time going home.  Engine growls when you want it to.

4.875,Very happy - overall a great purchase,Nate H. ,08/07/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,I purchased my 2008 Acura TL Type S in April.  4 months later I am still very happy.  Excellent acceleration and the gas mileage is surprisingly good.  I've been averaging 27 mpg with city/hwy combined.  Luxury and sport nicely combined.  The TL offers more leg room for rear passengers than the IS 250 and G35.  I wish the back seats were capable of folding down for my random stops at Lowes and Home Depot.  The doors are hard to keep open while exiting but I will survive.,"The navigation in my 08 TL is by far superior to my 06 GMC Envoy.  The hands free kit is exceptional.  Everyone says that I am very clear, I use it all the time.","Rain sensing wipers, ac vented seats would be a nice addition.  The information display for the radio, time, and AC is impossible to read in sunny conditions due to glare - some improvement is desperately needed."
4.875,Very happy I upgraded,Chas ,08/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"So far the experience has been great! I started looking around at smaller, more fuel efficient models like the Accord and Civic but finally gave in and decided that a little luxury and styling had to be worth something. I really like the handling but my one knock is that it seems to give the slightest vibration at around 60 but then over that it goes away.  I'll keep an eye on that but it might just be engine rattle at that rpm.  Corners seem to grab and hold like I am not used to and I find myself heading into curves with a bit more confidence. I am very happy that I decided to step up. This a no-brainer over the Accord for me.","By far the Hands Free Link, iPod jack, then styling. Spacious cabin the TL allows four 6 foot guys to travel very comfortably. The ability to get a nicely equipped car without nav. Other models seemed to give the niceties only if you get nav systems",Less vibration at high speed. More chrome on the exterior. The cassette seems like it's using up some prime real estate on the console. I dont care for the faux carbon fiber plastic interior molding. I actually think a wood inset steering wheel and wood trim would make the inside look more refined.
4.875,Buy this car!,I Love this Car! ,08/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I wanted a TL but I wanted to stand out from the crowd of other TL owners so I bought the TL-S with the aero body kit installed and it looks great.  I'm getting 22 mpg city on 87 octane.  I tried the 91 oct but I can't tell the difference on 2 tanks so I went back to 87 and it's just fine.  Love the nav system, I'd be so lost w/out it plus its a fun toy and great for resale when(if) I sell it.  Not a rocket ship but has plenty of power for city driving and has the Honda reliability, fit and finish.  It loaded with options that would cost thousands more with BMW, Lexus, Audi and Merc. Why pay more??","Quad exhaust, type-s rims, touch screen navigation, bluetooth, backup camera, hid lights, standard fog lights, lights on my mirrors for turning and the sound system!","AWD option, make it a rear wheel drive, more power for the Type-S, lose the cassette deck, make it stand out more from the standard TL, it can run on 87 oct (not premium it wants), maybe a hybrid option?"
5,Great car,Tim ,07/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5," Great car, handles well, good acceleration and fun to drive.  Very sporty and comfortable.

4.875,First Acura/Honda Purchase,TMac ,07/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I looked at many cars before buying this one. Mine is Bronze-Graphite with the charcoal/black interior. I traded in a Porsche and VW Jetta for the one TL-S, and feel it was a good decision. Performance is great, and for the price, what a deal!! It's faster than my 2000 Boxster, and I expect the reliability to be second to none. I just drove from Ft Worth to Houston, and got 30 mpg on the interstate with the cruise at 68. My in-town mixed driving delivers 22.5 mpg, and I drive fairly aggressive. Handling is great for a car of this type, and the fit and finish is as good as I have seen on any car. Interior is very sporty, but still luxurious. Style of Merc AMG or BMW-M Type for much less money","Still learning the voice prompts. The nav system, blue tooth are easy to use.  The sound system is superb. Very comfortable seats. There are no options on this car for a reason-it has it all. Has anyone really looked at the headlight assembly, or rear license surround? Both are spectacular designs.","I wish the steering provided a bit more road feel, and the rear windows were auto-down like the front. The Type S should come with 18"" wheels. Could use a bit more to differentiate the Type S from the base. Buyers, purchase the front and rear console carbon fiber pieces. Acura, dump the cassette."
4.875,2008 Acura TL-S Auto,Howie - NJ ,07/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"After researching several makes, Lexus, Infiniti, BMW, MB, etc., I purchased my TL-S in silver about one month ago. I wanted a 6 speed but they were hard to find so I took an automatic. I'm still getting used to driving the auto as well as front wheel drive after driving all wheel drive Audis for the last 8 years. Overall this car is great, no complaints so far. I love the styling of the interior and exterior and the gas mileage for an engine this size has been surprisingly good. On a recent trip (600 miles round trip) I averaged 33 mpg! This car offered by far the best bang for the buck.","You gotta love the styling touches on the S type, quad exhaust, two tone seats (mine are black/silver), sport pedals, paddle shifters. The navigation works really well and audio features are great. Price of car was hard to beat with the incentives offered. ","Not too much to complain about but the placement of the audio auxiliary jack for iPod, etc in the bottom of arm rest makes it very hard to reach. Also, why bother to include a tape player? Does anyone use them anymore? I also think the back-up camera is a bit of an overkill."
4.5,Impressive,Bonsai77 ,07/13/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,4,4,"For a base level sedan (w/navi) Acura certainly packs in the features. Voice recognition, rear view camera, GPS w/ real-time traffic option, sequential sport shifting.  Low torque is the only drawback - though it's not enough to impede a speedy freeway entry or over-taking. The manual shifting more than compensates.  General fit and finish - though well done - could use a little more of a solid feeling and refinement.  Overall - very happy with the purchase.","GPS, voice activated features, navigation place finder. ",Fit and finish. Low end power.

I've been averaging about 15-17 mpg in the city. This car likes to be driven out on the open road and highway, not stopping/starting, going over speed bumps, etc. I can't wait to take it out of the city to see what it can do. Love the on-board computer. Comfortable interior, too. Gadgets/ergonometry is not too hard to figure out, per editor's knock on this item. I would take this car over its competitors, a BMW or Lexus, any day of the week. Good value.

This is a great blend of functionality, luxury and performance.  The list of standard features is staggering.  When you compare this to a 3 series BMW you will find 40K plus to get close to the standard equipment on the TL, and that is with BMW's standard ""leatherette"" interior without upgrade.  Yes, for those who have not researched it, real leather is NOT standard on a 3 series, you pay about $1,500 to get it.  Now, at the very high end, BMW gets the performance nod, but for the average commuter, this is a win","Navigation, bluetooth, voice activated features, real time traffic and accident information is unreal.

The first, sunroof problems and engine check light on and drive light blinking not shifting from 3rd to 4th gear, etc. It wasted a lot of my time and gave me so much stress.

I can't walk away from the car without looking back at it.  The interior is well designed and has the look of understated elegance.  The extra benefit so far has been the incredible highway mileage.  I have been experiencing 32-34 mpg on our long TX highways traveling between 70 and 80 mpg.  This was better than I expected and much appreciated in a car this size.  Also, I was not a audiophile until i bought this car.  Excellent CD/XM experience.   I recently compared TL to the BMW5, MBE, Lexus ES and VolvoS80.

I wanted performance - sporty handling and 0-60 in less than 6 seconds.  The Acura's engine is very smooth with enough power.  The handling is excellent - sporty but not stiff, slight understeer.

With the list of standard features on the TL-S vs. paying a lot more money for it, with the others, it just made more since.

Thought TL handled better & quieter. Was not too crazy about the rims & taillight treatment on type s & 4 tailpipes (look like some cheap aftermarket replacments, disappointed for 38K+ car).

The last road trip I took saw the tl break the triple digit mph barrier with little trouble, very smooth at 100.

After 2000 RPMs the rough feeling under the floor clears up.  I have owned a lot of cars and our two other older vehicles (one of them is a truck and the other a small car) outperform this one. Other annoyances:  when It rains and you open the trunk, water jumps the gasket and pours into the trunk space - debris too.

I have yet to take it more that 450 consecutive miles on freeways so it may edge down a little but it held at the 30 mpg mark until I got back into Houston rush hour traffic.  I like so much about this car, but there are some small irritable things. Power outlets and MP3 jack are not conveniently located.  It is difficult to get anything in dash outlet when car is in park.  Fuel release is on floor right by door - on door or dash would be better.  The front window posts are a bit large which causes some minor obstruction of vision.  ",The ride and comfort are amazing. Handling is superb.  Just turning a corner feels like racing through mountainous roads. I love driving it.  There is plenty of acceleration; the ride is extremely quiet.

This is my third Acura and plan on a new MDX this summer.  The one thing that bothers me is that the TL is constantly compared to the Lexus IS, BMW 3-series, Infiniti G35, etc.  However the TL is bigger than all of these cars and actually the size of the Lexus GS & M45.","Solid everything, great stereo, luxury amenities and finish ","Cooled front seats and heated and cooled rear seats option,  power rear sunshade, AWD option, power folding mirrors.

Amazing ride for a performance veichle, love the aggressive look. I got the pearl white w/the grey rims, totally bad look. Love the bluetooth and navi, there are so many buttons though, could be more organzied! Great pickup, a real sleeper. Came to this car from a c230 kompressor. HUGE difference, car is much better built and easier to maintain gotta love honda's reliable and user friendly v-tech. Only 110 miles on the car but I feel I've made a great, reliable purchase. Plenty of room in the back for adults too! The only thing that is kinda crummy is the gas mileage, but hey, it's got power!",Bluetooth. Navi. LOOKS!,"I think the seats are kind of hard, but the car only has 100 miles on it  Dash controls should be able to be controlled thru the navi screen, as well as the phone options."
4.875,Wow!,RoswellDad ,01/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Where to begin?  I can't believe that a $34K car can have so many features and such performance.  Driving is fun again (and that's a challenge in Metro Atlanta traffic). The TL is a good-looking sports sedan that wants to go fast.  The only drawbacks are that it's rather sluggish at low speeds and the cost of premium fuel (but that's the price you pay to get a decent engine). Incredibly, I'm 54, and this is my first Japanese car, but I don't think it'll be my last.","Comfortable seats, plenty of gizmos, XM radio, powerful engine, interior layout, overall looks.",Engine runs sluggishly at speeds <25MPH.  Would be nice if it had automatic folding side mirrors.
4.5,Exceeding Expectations,James ,01/18/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"This car is everything my '05 Honda Accord wasn't... smooth lively engine, refined, responsive steeing & handling, high quality interior & exterior, great gas mileage for 258 hp.  From the beginning, this car has exceeded my every driving expectations.  The only other car I was considering was a used 06 BMW 330i, but with a $10k savings I'm only the wiser (and richer) without any compromises of the BMW!  Highly recommended.  A totally enjoyable ride!  ",Interior design and quality.  Steering & handling.  Great responsive braking.  Smooth paint.  Firm ride; great seats.  Right size.,Heated steering wheel. Minimize some of the overwrought styling (too many exterior lines with 07 & 08s).  Do a better job at matching bumper paint to rest of car (same thing with my 02 RSX).    
1.625,I hate this Car,fleurnj ,01/10/2008,,,4,1,1,1,,1,1,3,1,"Leased the TL with Nav (White/Taupe) in Dec 07. (24 month lease). After drooling over more expensive cars like the ES350 and Passat 3.6, I finally decided to save some money and go for this outgoing Acura model. I traded in my '04 EX V6 top-of-the-line Accord. I am very disaapointed with the TL. The navigation system in my '04 Accord was far superior than the one in this '08 TL. The TL Nav does not offer a male voice anymore, nor does it have the Trip Computer graphs, or A/C controls on the Nav screen anymore. The ride quality is awful. I HATE the stiff suspension and the extremely bumpy ride. I can feel every little bump and pothole on the road. I wish I could sell this car right away!",Low Price. Back-up camera. Interior design. Bi-xenon headlights.,Don't care...this is my last Honda product ever.
4.875,Most Bang For Buck Period!,Rizzo ,01/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"You simply cannot get more for the money!  You basically have 3 options: Type S or the regular TL with or without nav. To be able to get a sporty, yet luxurious fully loaded sedan with the nav. system for under $36,000 is unheard of.  Don't get me   wrong, I love the Lexus IS, Infiniti G35 and yes the BMW 3 series, but paying up to an extra $10,000 for some of these other models is just not worth it.  It handles well and is just simply fun to drive with a ton of amenities that even make rush hour traffic seem trivial.  Seriously, if you're looking for a new ride in this class, you owe it to yourself to check this car out. There has to be a reason for all the great reviews + TLs on the road","Great GPS, audio everything and a fantastic blue tooth set-up. To be quite honest, there are too many favorite features to list. Just test drive one of these and you'll know what I mean.",An available AWD model would be a nice addition. 
5,The best,Al ,01/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I had a budget up to 50 thousand and was looking at lexus and infiniti.  Then decided to test drive tl-s and realized that it is the best car for my needs.  It was one of the most quiet and comfortable cars, with enough power for daily commutes.    The car is built with amazing quality in all the details inside/out.  Fuel economy is decent - after 1400 miles computer shows 20 MPG with average speed 29 miles.  I anticipate expensive maintenance on this car - tires, brakes, etc.",I love voice recognition system and real time traffic updates.  Sound system is great,"Trip computer could be more sofisticated. Most of the information should be dispalyed on the navigation screen, like outside temperature or gas milage.  Wheel buttons should change navigation settings.  Phone info should be connected to navigation screen too."
4.75,Nice TL,jdr475 ,01/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,Bought this car for my wife at the end of 2007 from a Minivan. Change was well worth it. She loves the TL and it is extremly comfortable and easy to drive. Navigation and Bluetooth are great.,Bluetooth and ride comfort. Very quiet as well.,"Would like to see an AWD option, but for the most part, not changes that I can see"
4.875,No Doubts about it.,No Doubts about it ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased this vehicle after owning a 2005 Altima, and this was my best decision that I have made so far in life.  I have received so many compliments on the vehicle looks.  My husband is constantly wanting to drive me around on the weekends in it.  I love the sportiness of it and just the overall luxurious feel of the vehicle. The fact that the car comes standard with alot of luxurious features is a plus.  With the right deal you can purchase a luxury line vehicle for about the same price as a Honda Accord Ex-L- V6","Hands free link, reverse tilt mirrors, sunroof and all standard features.",Add some chrome features on the outside of the vehicle to make the dark colors pop.  Maybe also improve the city mileage.

Like its name TL (Touring Luxury), you would love to drive the sporty sedan with its build in luxury experience that put you right in the driving mode (not commute mode). Unlike Lexus, Acura TL and BMW series give you the communication with the dirt on the road. If you like to drive on the air (like Toyota with small wheels and big rubber tire), TL is not for you. It is always a hardship to blend luxury with sporty features. Acura TL seamlessly combined them. ",TL's rear body shape makes most of the sedans on the road seem alike.,Folded mirror and SuperHandling All wheel drive (SH-AW) like the RL.
5,New TL-S,Yohann ,12/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had my new CBP TL-S with 6M for just over a week now and I am totally in love with it. My old car is a 1998 Maxima 5M and on my daily driving routine (of about 13 miles freeway and 10 miles side streets), I have been averaging 22 mpg. Possibly because I tend to accelerate hard and partly because I typically cruise at 77-80 mph on the interstate (depending on traffic). On my first tank with the TL-S (including 20 minutes idling at the dealer), I averaged about 24 MPG and so far on the second tank my average is between 25-26. That's pretty impressive considering that the TL is 450 lbs heavier and has a 100 hp over the Maxima, and not to mention just over 300 miles on the engine.  ","Looks, reliability, ease of use, ride, mileage","more horsepower, softer seats"
4.875,Acura TL Type-S is a MONSTER!!,vegasrph ,12/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Ok. This car likes to go fast, very fast. It feels very secure, but she likes to ""boogie""!! I test drove a lot of cars before leasing the TL-S and I have to say, I made the right choice. Fuel economy isn't bad, isn't great either. So far I am averaging 20mpg, but for a car that has 286HP and F-1 style paddle shifters, its not bad. :) The car has room for 4/5 adults and golf clubs, plus it MOVES down the road with a lot of autority. The exhaust note is seductive, NAV is awesome, paddle shifters are sweet, handling is secure and often feels neutral, very much a ""sleeper"" on the street and easy to blow the doors off a BMW/Lexus/MB and give you a grin ear to ear. Get one, you will LOVE IT! :)","POWER, NAV, voice command, looks, ipod jack standard, F-1 paddle shifters, interior is comfortable (I am 6'5"") and a usable trunk.","Lose the cassette deck, add a 40GB hard drive to store music, make 18"" wheels standard, let owner choose the rear spoiler instead of standard lip spoiler."

4.875,Type-S is a FANTASTIC RIDE!!,vegasrph ,12/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Wow. Where do I begin? Well, coming from a BMW 325i all I can say is wow! What a difference!! The Acura is actually more fun to drive, has more room, you get the ""all-inclusive"" package when you get the Type-S vs BMW everything is ""a la carte"". So far I have only 300 miles on my Type-S, but I LOVE IT!! My first, second and third test drives were all very fun. I was able to ""push"" the test cars very hard and every time I left the dealer, I had a huge smile. The Acuralink NAV is amazing, seriously. This car can do it all! Very impressed with road noise suppression and overall ride. This car is FAST and NIMBLE without loosening your tooth fillings :)","The whole car! Seriously, it is that good... I mean great. The nav is unbeatable in my opinion (no stupid iDrive knob, or any dumb & distracting turn knobs) it's voice + touch operated! The power of this car is very addictive (watch your speed! :)) Overall refinement, ride, looks, power, sound.","Lose the outdated tape deck. How about power fold mirrors? 6 speed auto would be nice, too. Tune the exhaust a little louder. It still sounds good, but it could be a tad louder."

4.75,A Fun and Comfortable Ride,kkrtrek ,12/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Traded in our 10-month old Civic for the TL because the tall driver (me) could not get comfortable in the driver's seat. Otherwise, the Civic was the perfect car. The TL solved the comfort problem with very comfortable, adjustable seats. It is fun to drive, easy to handle, and just an all around ""nice car."" Was looking for a somewhat sporty sedan for the family of three. Neither the wife nor I wanted the soft ride of a Camry or a Lexus(?), nor the harsh ride of a true sports car. For us, the TL hit the sweet spot in the middle. Still getting used to the ""luxury"" aspects of owning this car. ",Carbon bronze pearl exterior mated with taupe interior. Spiffy and classy. Sound system. Memory seats. Backup camera. ,"Better mileage. On a trip, got 28 true MPG driving very conservatively, 60-63 (Trip computer gives MPG about 8% too high). Honda has a larger 3.5 liter engine in the Accord that gets better mileage. Folding rear seat (at least half) and regular fuel, like the Honda. Turning radius quite large."
4.5,Not 100% Pleased,Alex Lee ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,4,4,"Low end torque is not as good as i had hoped. above 2500 rpm the car moves well.  The manual side on the 5A is sluggish, upshifts are not crisp.  The engine has some noticeable vibrations at 1500 rpm, 2000 rpm and 4000 rpm.  The 2000 rpm point is most noticeable at takeoff, it is felt in the steering wheel and foot pedals.  ","My favorites are the radio-stereo system, heated outside mirrors, heated seats, lighted steering wheel controls.","Reduce vibrations from engine, add larger rear brakes, eliminate noise from antilock brake module when cycling.

4.875,Nothing Like It,Highway Star ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The commute was never so short!  I drive about 500 miles a week and need a car that is safe and responsive.  The TL Type-S has got to be the best value of any car on the road today.  All the reviews compare it with cars that are much more expensive with the same equipment.  For me, the nav traffic and voice-activated everything is key since you can keep focused on the road and not the controls.  The Brembo brakes and tuned suspension gives you a level of confidence that keeps you sharp.  I drove the Moroccan Red as a demo and bought the same car a month later.  Great comments from everyone - the contrasting dark wheels and body accents put it in a class by itself.  One awesome ride!","Interior and exterior fit and finish, voice activated everything, darker taillight bezels, turn signals on the mirrors, HID lights.","Sure the gas mileage could be better, but I'm OK with 26 mpg highway before the first oil change.  The torque steer is there, but you really have to land on it to feel it pull hard."
4.875,Never Looking Back,Acura Girl For Life ,12/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I came from driving a Honda Civic (4 cylinders) to the beautifully sleek Acura TL. My best friend and I instantly fell in the love with the sexy body and outstanding features. She has the white diamond pearl with parchment interior and i have the nighthawk black pearl with ebony interior. I wanted the Navigation system but was presented with a pricing offer that was too good to pass up so I went w/o. Even though I know it is not the same, I can always buy one.","The standard features are just amazing - comfortable heated seats, beautiful exterior appearance, hands-free bluetooth, excellent braking, ride is smooth, and very roomy.","Even though I knew the gas mileage would be considerably less than the honda civic, I was disappointed with how fast I used a half a tank of gas."

The vehicle is an excellent blend of power, handling, and interior refinement. A comparable BMW would be significantly more expensive. The competitor vehicles, such as the G35 and the IS350 are good cars but lack the professional finish seen in Acura vehicles. After a week of ownership, there are no visible flaws.

5,Love this car,Treetop Flyer ,12/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Traded in a 2004 F150 supercrew which we really liked. We were looking for a sporty sedan with better mileage than the 14mpg we were getting with the truck. Went to the Seattle Auto Show and we liked three models. The first two dealers we went to didn't have the model we liked in stock. Then we went to our local Acura dealer and it was all over. We didn't want the test drive to end. We bought this car for better mileage and good looks and good handling. We averaged 22mpg on our first two tanks of gas; some highway and some city driving.,The navi is great and very useful. The back-up camera is very handy. The voice commands are fun. And all this is standard on the Type S. A real no brainer. We love the white diamond pearl with the bronze type S wheels. It's like driving a four door Corvette it handles so well.,None.
4.875,Great Car!!!!!,PaulS ,12/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Purchased the TL Type S auto and love the car.  Narrowed down my search to the G35 and TL. Final decision was based on convenience of the dealership and the fact that I love everything about the car.  The ride is firm with a ton of power (286 hp) under the hood.  The interior has all the conveniences and then some like the real-time traffic nav system, XM radio and Bluetooth.  The interior quality is top notch.  Love the exterior and I think the TL has a unique look unlike a lot of the other models.","Nav, Bluetooth, radio, power, handling",Adjustable gas/brake pedals

I was going to purchase the '08 335i (drove sedan/coupe) - as a fluke (just happened to be at the dealership with a friend) I drove the TL Type S and bought the car the next day (no comparison to the BMW). The growl of the quad exhaust is hot. The car looks a bit demure but hit the gas and watch out! Everyone loves it. As most here, I also got the Carbon Bronze Pearl and think that color suits the darker rims very well. I'm very glad I decided to take a test drive that day. I also drove the car with an auto transmission and like the automatic better (the second auto I've ever owned).","Everything - automatic lights, voice activation for controls and navi, LED tail/mirror lights, quad exhaust, acceleration, braking is amazing, bluetooth, red ambient lighting, luxury detailing, one-touch features . . . did I name everything?  :)","Better gas mileage. If you push the car hard you will notice some torque steer. It doesn't take hard curves as well as my Honda did, but this is a much bigger car. Center armrest could be higher.

5,Can't believe what I drive everyday,amazed ,09/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got more than 2000 miles on my new TL and I cannot believe that I actually drive this car to work everyday. Take it from a dealership parking lot to downtown and watch reflections of yourself. When you open the door, it whispers (not screams) luxury!  I love all the features: seat memory settings, hands-free link, navigation, dual climate, sound system.  Driving is very smooth and comfortable and, if you want, very sporty as well. Perfect balance. You can drive your mother in law in a limo and your friends in a sports car all in the same vehicle. Driving in the heavy rain, passing 18-wheelers, up the hill in curvy road, all of it is pure driving passion. MPG is OK, 28/23 so far.","This car just looks, feels and drives fantastic.","4WD.

The car is built like a vault with great handling and performance. The bronze metallic exterior with taupe interior is a knockout. Standard amenities, such as the nav system, are nothing short of luxurious.

My 328 sold and I picked up my new Acura on Sat, Aug 11th.  First the car handles amazingly well for a car that is quite a bit larger than the BMW. The TL S type has an amazing engine with more than enough power.  The interior is beautiful to look at with the two tone leather seats and sharp accents.  My cool younger friends and my 18 year old nephew raved about this car and both the exterior and interior.  Everybody seems to like it.  I got the bronze color which looks amazing with the rims.
