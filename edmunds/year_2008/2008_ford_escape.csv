4,Great little commuter and outdoor rig,Stephanie ,10/25/2016,5,4,,,,5,4,4,,,,"I've had this little suv for three years now. 3rd owner. The only problems I've had was a sensor for the steering that got fixed for a couple hundred. The trunk doesn't pop open, something electrical, still need to get it checked out. But as far as gas and reliability, I've taken it to and from work and even hunting out on the dirt roads and it has proved itself a nice little rig. I put on some brand new all terrain tires. I  love the 5 speed because I can downshift and be more in control when I am on forest roads.",,
1,So done with Ford!,Veronica ,09/10/2016,1,,1,,,1,1,1,5,,,"I have always owed Ford vehicles for the last 22 years; well no more. I am moving on and will never own one again! I currently own a 2008 Ford Escape in which I bought brand new in 2007. I fell in love with it from the first moment I saw it with its Kiwi green color, moonroof, and spacious interior. As soon as I test drove it, I knew I wanted it. First off it's supposed to get 28 miles to the gallon on the highway but only gets 21. It is rusted out only on the driver side front tire well (common problem I've read online) and the paint is peeling on the drivers side of the hood. The paint on the interior finishes has rubbed off on some places, and the seats have always been a nightmare to keep clean (also common complaint). I am literally scrubbing them on a weekly basis. Water even stains them. If my kids are damp from the pool, their body shape is left on the seat until I clean them. It's so frustrating! The seat belts even stain. I don't know what from because the kids do not eat or drink inside. The bolts inside are even rusted. I have always taken care of the things I own. My Escape has always been garage kept and has been washed on a weekly basis and always washed to get the snow and salt off in the winter. It only has 67,000 miles on it and the transmission is going out. It also has a chirping noise when I first start it (also common). The drivers side window goes up slow in the cold weather and sometimes will even get stuck and I will have to wait 20 minutes to roll it up inch by inch until it's completely rolled up. Customer service from Ford completely sucks. They do not care about the customer or their complaints. There have been two recalls on it and two more common problems that should be on recall. One being the rusted out paint above the drivers side tire, which is a common complaint, and there should also be a recall for the tone ring. I've had it in the shop twice for a broken tone ring which was not cheap. I was proud to buy a Ford because it was made in the USA and didn't receive a buyout like GM. Well I no longer care about that. I will be getting a Cadillac SRX soon and can't wait! This thing has knickel and dimed me and I am done. Washing my hands of Ford!

3,Good and bad with the 2008 Escapeâ€¦.,Carla ,03/15/2016,,3,2,,,3,3,3,4,,,"I bought my Escape 8 years ago. Only 85,000 miles on it at this point. Here are the facts: What I have had to have fixed: since new, Liftgate rattled: numerous trips/replacement by dealership. Ford engineer stumped. Put duct tape around the too-small latch pin and it rattles no more. Automatic part of dome light quit. Replaced once, then quit again. Left it that way. Waterpump needed replaced at 75,000 miles. Control arm starting to come loose at 75,000 miles. Replaced battery and tires once. Now I have a small oil leak starting at 85,000 miles. Was told that this year of Escape is notorious for leaking oil and eventually needing a $5,000 repair to head gasket to fix. Advised me to continue to drive it the way it is, as the repair worth more than the car. Leak is very minimal, no low oil between changes. Seat coverings are horrible. Water even stains them, and you can't get the stains out. Dealer told me he has no idea how to get them out either. Interior and exterior rusting, even though 100% garaged and regularly cleaned/waxed. You be the judge.",,
5,Excellent vehicle,Chase ,02/15/2016,,5,4,,,5,4,5,4,,,Ok let me say this many post reviews based on the experiences in repair shops.  And a bad experience with minor things.  Overall the escape is a terrific vehicle as with anything it requires maintenence and fluid changes frequently as well as filters.  I only have one negative from driving on freeways. Its the moonroof noise.  I pirchased a wind deflector hopefully it helps.  Over all no problems as of yet recently inspected. Repairs not so bad. But it adds up if your not quick to take care of problems as soon as it rises.  Play it smart,,
1,DANGEROUS TO DRIVE!,Taylor ,02/12/2016,1,1,1,,,1,1,1,2,,,"My mother had purchased a brand new Ford Escape in 2008 and then gave it to me this year as my first car. I thought it would be safe to drive an SUV until the malfunctioning torque censor almost sent my boyfriend and I off the road at 75mph during our road trip across the U.S. I received a recall notice a few months before and had brought it in to fix the problem, It only took about 15 minutes and I was told everything was fine. Obviously this was NOT true and the auto repair shop we took it to in Nashville, TN emphasized it was VERY unsafe to drive and told me that they had done NOTHING when I brought it in the for the recall. We then took the car over to a Ford dealership close by and were told that it was going to cost us over $600 for something that should've been resolved under the recall. We spoke to customer service at Ford corporate and they said ""their hands were tied"" and they ""couldn't do anything for us"" because we already had it taken in for the recall. I'm extremely disappointed with how Ford handled this matter and I worry about other customers and their families if this were to happen to them too.",,

To be expected of an older car I suppose. Electrical in drivers seat went out. Front end rods needed replaced. Starter was going bad. Some of the interior was also wearing. Given the years we lived out west and now in the south, I suppose the oppresive heat likely accelerated these issues as I know people who have 2004 escapes and have had none of these issues.

Ford's GREAT idea of making the transmission cooler, and the A/C condenser all one piece. This adds a big price for the part. When your cooler needs changed the A/C Freon needs to be emptied, then fill again, which adds to the labor cost. Good thinking Ford! Even though this is connected to the drive train, and keeps your transmission from failing, its not a drive train part, and not cover cause its not internal. ...",,"Hopefully Ford does the right thing, and reimburses the customer for the mistake THEY made in the construction of the transmission cooler.

The Transmission Cooler sprung a leak, causing 5 qts of tran. fluid to leak out. The gears wouldn't shift correctly from first to second gear and the car was stalling at every stop light. After a $900 bill, I thought the issue was the weight, but the car could tow over 3500 lbs, according to the manual. If I were you, I wouldn't buy this car or you will eventually have the same problems. The car is under powered and Ford's manufacturing quality is still poor. ","I like three things. The dash is well organized and the overall structure seems very robust for hard use. The interior is appealing, though the seats are cheap. The best part is the exterior, it looks good from the outside to fool you how poor the engine on the inside.","Well, I think the biggest problem is the quality.

Recently, when it was time for me to purchase a new car, I looked to the Ford Escapes to replace my beloved '97 Ford Explorer. I ended up purchasing a 4 cylinder '08 Escape and I must say, I have not been impressed with it. I bought this car as a fuel-efficient replacement to my '97 Explorer. What I found was that my new '08 Escape actually less fuel efficient than my older Explorer, which was made over a decade earlier.  I was so impressed with my '97 Explorer that it blinded me into a brand loyalty towards Ford.

We were so impressed with the quality of the Limited package we've also used the car as our primary vehicle to drive to and from work. We've leased this vehicle, and I suspect we'll keep with the Escape next year when the lease is up.

I believe it is rated just higher than that (25-26). Debated about the 6 cylinder 4x2, but happy with my choice.   ",Enjoy the 4x4. Built in Sirius radio is a must! Great small SUV. Lots of room at an affordable price. ,"Annoying extra swipe of the wipers when using the washer fluid leaves streaks.

The first one had braking issues and after being in the shop for an entire month, they exchanged me for another 2008 Escape. This one has been no different. I have owned this one for 9 days and already it will be in the shop for 3 days for ABS, Traction control and a loud Vibration that actually slows the vehicle down. All the issues with both have been rear end and braking issues. Not good! I have been in rental vehicles for 5 weeks now. So not only did I get one lemon, I actually have had two! I've driven Ford all my life so this is my 1st bad experience. Not very good gas mileage, not what was specified.","Reverse sensors, the upgraded stereo sounds awesome. The black interior looks great, the hand controls on steering wheel are nice. Like the compass option.",The black shiny material used for the dash collects dust easily and is very noticeable.

I mentioned I was looking for much improved mileage, so when I saw this Vista Blue 5-speed I said let's take a test-drive. A winner in terms of what I was looking for. Sold! My first tank averaged out to 22.8 MPG and I probably did only 20% highway. Very pleased. ","Styling and value. Roominess and economy. Vista Blue, used to have an Electron Blue Vette.

It has a little bit stronger, more masculine exterior look to it, which I like!  Most important is the better fuel economy. My F-150 had a 27 gallon tank, Ouch! The interior design is a little plain but very roomy. It's very fun to drive! I think I made a wise decision. I also got a cheaper truck note when I got the Escape. That's always nice too.

The ride is smooth.  The V6 packs plenty of power while maintaining a fairly solid fuel economy (~25 mpg for our use)  The exterior design just looks beautiful and makes you want to drive out to Yosemite National Park for a campout.  The seats are comfortable.  The interior is very roomy and the design is very nice/elegant for the lady while retaining enough of that rugged look for me. We have had the car now for one month and it rocks!",Looks cool. Excellent drive.

I owned a Dodge Neon SXT and it was cramped and small and at times and it wasn't big enough for the two of us so had to upgrade. I have owned 3 Dodges, 1 Ford, and 1 Chevy.

Hidden compartment in console is nice to stash valuables out of sight. No more problems with spinning of rear wheels in wet weather like the Jeep. Took it on a short trip, cruise worked really nice.

The Ford Escape fit the bill. It is the first new domestic car my wife has owned! She drives it more then I do. We got the FWD modal. I am impressed with the traction on very icy and heavy snow covered roads. It is very quit on the highway. We have some good friends that almost bought a Honda CRV, (but decided on a GTI). They thought the Escape is a better buy. I would highly recommend this car. ",Very smooth and quiet drive. Decent pep for a 4 banger. Bright and roomy cabin. Interesting color.

This little SUV has plenty of room inside for the two and some of the grandkids plus it's got plenty of pep when you press the gas. And it stills gets close to 21 MPG driving in town.  We're very pleased with it.,"The entertainment center is nice, plus the leather seats.  Interior room is also a plus for a small vehicle.",Entry assist handles would be nice.

But.... the brakes make this awful popping noise every time they get hot. I have taken it to the shop 5 times for repairs. The shop had replaced every bit of the back end, yet they still pop. We brought it to the attention of the manufacturer and the engineers said this ""was a normal variation of the vehicle and it does not affect braking performance"". Funny thing, they can't identify what is making the noise so how they know it's not affecting brake performance? .your guess is as good as mine. This is my first and last Ford.

Quick and snappy, can park anywhere. Just a lot of fun to drive. Great sound system. We looked at mid-sized SUV's  but decided we wanted something smaller and this fits the bill. Lots of power. Weather has been bad nearly since purchase and I drive in AWD a lot, plus with zero degree weather or below, longer warm up periods are required so I am not seeing the great fuel mileage people are talking about. (17 mpg) I hope that chances with the weather conditions. Overall very pleased.","Looks buff. Really like the newer look over previous models. More rugged looking.

The newer body style is what peaked my interest at first-not a huge fan of the older looks.  I decided on a nicely loaded Escape over a standard Edge.  I am very happy.  The interior is different from what I've had in the past, but took no time to get used to.  I love the satellite.  Very room and clean interior.  Sunroof is nice and big.  So far the FWD with traction has done well in some higher snow for me.  The drive feels great and so far gas mileage is good.  I love the convenience package features as well.  I got the Kiwi Green color and absolutely love it, everyone notices and likes it. I am very happy with my Escape","Kiwi green paint, sunroof & satellite package, new body style, interior controls & ice blue interior lights.","Very small glove compartment (but the under armrest storage is very roomy), like others have said, a 5-6 speed.

Love the handleability of FWD in the ice and snow while still getting a smooth ride on dry roads.  One complaint, the cruise control creeps up in hilly interstate driving.  Both of our Escapes can gain 3 to 5 mph when going up hill and then it stays there after cresting. Overall it's a great auto.","Softer blue lights, interior room, reversible cargo floor carpet to rubber mat, bigger side view mirrors. Sound systems very nice.","Entry assist handles, tire jack on the side instead of under the floor(flat tires only happen when the rear of the car is loaded), Rear seat head rest storage area needed. better cruse reliability. 6 CD changer should be standard.

It was comfortable from the get-go, handles very well and accelerates smartly.  It is not choppy riding (try comparing it to a Focus SVT).  Friends have commented on how smooth the ride is and how comfortable the car is.  The power steering is well-balanced but could do with a bit less assist.  I do not find any problem with the braking nor with gentle acceleration.  Fuel economy is decent--not horrible but not super.  In my case I use a gallon more fuel per week than I used to with my Mustang.","Overall comfort.  Overall balance of features.  Logical, user-friendly design.","Improve the included angle of the driver's side view mirror.  Put all the on/off control buttons on the same vertical line.

My big dog can fit in easily behind the 2nd row seat along with some groceries without a problem. The engine is very smooth and peppy. The acceleration is a little slow, I think, but heck, I'm not a race car driver, nor do I want to waste gas for quick acceleration.",Roomy interior. New outside looks. Aluminum wheels. Flip open rear glass.,5 speed auto is a must.
5,A Nice Driving Machine,Mike ,05/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I didn't like the old Escape, so as soon as I saw the new Escape, I went to a dealer and test-drove one. It was much much quieter than the old one my brother is driving.  Also, I like the front new grille. The price is also very reasonable compared to ridiculously asking price of a RAV4. I cross-shopped with a RAV4 and CRV and found the starting prices are similar, but once I add the same options a Escape has, the Japanese models cost $3K more. The feul economy is what I expected. It just gives me an everyday enjoyment on the road to work and home.  I like the curtain bag, too.","Safety items like the curtain bags, stability control, and the new front grille.",A 3rd row seat.
3.25,Not what I expected,HelpMeEscapeIt ,05/23/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,2,2,3,3,"'08 Escape XLS AWD is part of company car plan, best option of the 3 choices offered. Have had vehicle for 6 weeks, and just hit 5000 miles. Overall rate vehicle as fair. Unimpressed with engine power, cabin noise and vibration. Driver's seat is horrible, will fatigue you on short trips. Mileage is good (24 mpg on average mainly hwy). Little features missing like auto headlight shutoff, daylight running lights and seatback pockets. Had issue with vehicle starting after sitting for 2 days during first 1500 miles (imagine what might be in store after it gets 50k or more on it). I keep hoping for the best... but this isn't even close.","Exterior style, tire size, AWD, cargo space, radio jack (for XM or iPod), fuel mileage, rear hatch door (dual opening feature).","Seat comfort, engine severly underpowered, cabin noise,floor vibration when accelerating, auto off lights, seatback pockets, better key (yes the key is awkward with an intgrated fob)"
5,Fun and Handles Great,Kat ,05/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just picked up the 2008 Ford Escape 4WD with the V6. I love this SUV. The handling and comfort is great with the leather interior. I wish it had more HP, but with all the interior cargo space and room in that little truck, I can't complain. Great value for the money. Fun to drive and I can really zip around, turns on a dime. Can't wait until winter.","Kiwi Green color is so awesome, the satellite radio, the leather seats, new exterior styling (new grille and painted rear fascias).",Only need a 5 or 6-speed AT and a little more HP.
5,The Best Compact SUV So Far,Bob Crane ,05/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I owned a Honda CRV but  didn't like the driving.  So, I checked out Ford Escape and loved it during the test drive. The driving was completely different from my old CRV. I felt I was so miserable driving the CRV. Now I'm more than happy with my Escape. The fuel economy is as good as CRV. I don't know why people say Japanese cars have better fuel economy than domestics. The fit and finish is awesome, too. I'm 6'2"", but still snug enough in my Escape.  Oh, by the way, it's much much quieter than the old CRV, and even my friend's new CRV or RAV4 I've driven.  My friends envy me and tells me as soon as their CRV, RAV4 lease expires, they buy Escape",Exterior design. It doesn't look like a compact SUV. The smooth and fun driving. Great fuel economy.,I wish I had a bigger space.
5,Best SUV I've ever owned!,Mike ,05/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've been driving my Escape for about 3 months and I can tell you this. This is the best buy with your money. This is the true money saver. Very quiet interior and the fit and finish is second to none. My kids like the cool exterior design, although I don't like the grille much, but overall it's a strong SUV with a very good feul economy and cargo space. The new instrument panel over the old model is greatly improved and the price is virtually unchanged. The driving is so much fun between my work and home. I should have bought this earlier. Ford seems to find out what customers really want except 5 speed auto.",Big deep center console. Spacous cargo area. Tough outside look and great fuel economy.,5 or 6 speed auto can improve the fuel economy.
4,2008 Ford Escape XLT,David ,05/14/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Opted for the Escape over the RAV4 based on exterior design - looks more SUV like and handsome. Although the RAV4 has a stronger engine and better gas mileage. Always been a fan of Ford. First domestic I have bought in some years, let's see if the brand has improved.","Design, ride, front seating, console",Better gas mileage. Not crazy about the center display. Hard to see in bright light
5, I Love the 2008 Escape,Mike ,05/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I looked at several other Ford options including the Edge and opted for the 2008 Escape because of the overall lighter vehicle weight and somewhat smaller duratec 4 valve engine. This CUV is really excellent. Great new IP and we have the Sun and Sound package with satellite radio and a plug-in for my iPod. It is awesome. There is loads of places to put things with the Rear Cargo Convenience package. The center console has a drop-in insert that holds audio/cell phone stuff.  When you remove this insert you can put lesser used items in the space just below the insert. Maps fit very well in map pockets.  It handles very well and has RSC, roll stability standard.","All the safety features. Side Impact air bags, inflatable canopy dual power airbags. Love the styling and how it plays off the Explorer/F150 front-end theme.",Slightly bigger glove box.
4.875,Sharp and fun to drive,Rick ,04/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I have owned this Escape for almost a month. It is very stylish and fun to drive. We live in a rural area and we average 23 mpg. I think it is also quieter than the 2005 Escape that we owned before. Overall I am very satisified with this vehicle.,,
4.75,Great Changes,Rob ,03/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,We have a XLT 4WD and what a dramatic difference from the older versions...especially the interior...thank goodness. This new version is so much better in my opinion. Dramatically quieter and more comfortable and the prices are actually lower than last year's model. We have some very steep hills in our area with gravel roads and the all wheel drive handles them with ease without any loss of traction and the transmission does all the braking on the way downhill with little effort saving my brakes the wear and tear. Love this CUV!,,A 5 speed transmission would be more in tune with other manufacturers however the 4 speed does the job well for the most part.
