Test drove it before I even got to a Scion TC and immediately fell in love. Easy to drive, looks sharp after being washed- especially with tinted windows. Only problem I ever had was running the stereo too long without the car being turned on so the battery died, easy jump though. Plastic grille on the front popped out once, but I stuck it back in.

It's a fun car to drive, and I'll likely put some work into it once the warranty is up, but for now it has little power and poor mileage. Spend the little extra for the LT. I regret that I didn't.","I love the radio included. XM, mp3/wma, and how it does it's presets. Its neat.","Make the armrest standard! Really, it seems silly to not have an armrest.

At $9999 this basic model had just what I wanted, including a tight 5-speed manual trannie, almost as buttery smooth as Honda. (Power windows are over-rated anyway.)  The caster is a bit too strong, the steering ratio is a bit too sharp, and the steering wheel is a bit too small, so it won't drive itself like a Civic. If you're making a sharp right, be advised to keep a firm grip on the wheel, 'cause it will snap back in the direction it's pointing in a hot lick.  But Hey, it's from Detroit! I started with a '49 Chevy, and I'm back home.","Information display, Fold-down rear seats (open to trunk), Good sound proofing. Zippy performance and comfortable to drive.

Has turned in 39.7mpg on 160 mile trip driving at 60 mph on freeway. Vehicle was purchased as a run around unit with trips not longer than 3 hours thus comfort (i.e. as in our Town & Country Van) was not a priority.

I would have opted for the darker seats too, I got my light seats sprayed with a special scotch guard type spray with a warranty to keep the interior looking nice. Spoiler makes it dangerously hard to see out of back, but love the ways it makes the exterior look. ","XM radio (free 90 day trial), information button that tells you average MPG, two trip sets, tire pressure, outside temp, how many miles til your out of gasoline etc. Quiet ride. Fold down seats perfect for snowboards. Keyless entry, car finder (push alarm button for 1 second, and car will honk 3x)","Compass on mirror. It's hard to get in and out of back seat, and I'm 5.5 and thin. Trunk opening too small. Larger fuel capacity. I think its only a 12 gallon. Map lights should be standard.

5,Great Car,Stan ,07/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I just purchased my Chevy Cobalt and I love it. It's very quiet inside and has an extremely smooth ride for it's size. The electronic powered steering has excellent feel and control and the vehicle corners very well. It has plenty of power and it's a breeze to parallel park. I have the LS 4 door sedan in slate gray metallic. The light gray interior and silver pin striping add a rich touch. I highly recommend this vehicle!,"My favorite features include the driver's information center, satellite radio and suprisingly large trunk.",My only improvement suggestion would be a better rear view when backing up. It is somewhat blocked by the high seat backs and head rests.

This had the best ride, best fuel mileage,, smoothest operation, and best price. With factory incentives the car cost $12,100. I was very objective and simply couldn't pass up this great car. I liked the size of some others like the Scion XB but the ride was harsh and jiggly, gas pedal operation was abrupt. The Chevy is way easier to drive. We have them in our fleet at work and the mechanics say they are the most reliable cars we have ever owned.","Price, fuel mileage",More stylish interior but only if it doesn't drive the price up
4.625,Awesome for the price,Chris ,07/07/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,3,"I bought my Cobalt last February.  I originally wanted a VW Rabbit but after a bit of sticker shock ($17,000) I decided to keep things basic. With incentives and deals, my Cobalt was $12,500 out the door. I have no options but CD/mp3/auxillary jack and air condition were standard. I just drove from Detroit to Chicago and averaged 37 mpg by going 65 and easing of the gas pedal when going up hill.  It's not as nice as the foreign competition, but I saved thousands on the car. The warranty is decent too. And I kept Americans employed with my purchase. Long live Detroit!",I love the auxilliary jack on the radio and the standard a/c does a good job. ,The cloth seats tend to stain very easily. One small spill and the mark will be there forever.

That car stunk, but this car is great so far. I love the handling and the acceleration, even for an automatic like mine. For a 4 popper, you simply cannot beat it. The car is stylish and bold with many nice features. The engine sounds like a Honda. What blew me away was, however, the performance. I thought that it would have decent acceleration and good handling, but this car, even being the basic LS model, has terrific performance. Driving home from the lot I wanted to try it out, and a guy in a tricked out 07 GTI wanted to go and he enjoyed a view of my tailpipe.","Instrument gauge features, performance, XM satellite. Again, bang for buck, you get a steal when it comes to performance. I can only imagine what the SS package would bring to the table. I also really like the cargo room in the back. In my opinion, it is plenty large. Averaging 34 mpg","Make power windows and door locks standard on all models.

I wish I would have known the Cobalt XFE was coming out. I would have waited because if I am getting 35 mpg on the highway with the reg Cobalt, the XFE has to be getting atleast 40 mpg on the highway. For around $12,500 you cant go wrong! ",,

MSRP Sticker was 16650 with transportation. I am pleased that side airbags were made standard for 2008 (antilock brakes should be too IMHO) The car is quiet compared with a Dodge Caliber I recently rented. Also the Cobalt shifts smoothly. The light grey interior will get dirty fast I think. Back seat is real tight. ,Acceleration is there when needed. Front seat has good legroom if no-one is in back. XM radio free preview is nice. Quiet Ride Price was awesome -- I feel like with the rebates I got that I would've been hard pressed to find a better deal on a comparable car.,Back seat room is crappy cupholders are not ideal 1LT package but still no cabin lights other than overhead and have to reach up to turn this on as opposed to optional control at the dimmer on dash like most cars. Gas mileage is as stated but still pretty crappy for an economy car. 
4.5,LT,Matt ,01/29/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,5,4,5,5,Loved the color of the vehicle and the radio. It has good acceleration and abs brakes grab smoothly. So far fuel economy has been great. The computer in dash is real nice. This car will make a nice commuter car ,Radio,Better exhaust pipe
5,America at its best-wave your flag,cragman1 ,01/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I suppose every car has a ""target market"". I'm not sure if they had me, a 52 yr old family guy who grew up in the 60's in mind, but Chevy won me over with this puppy. I had a lease coming to an end on a 2006 Saturn Ion (which I found to be ""acceptable"" like some reviews including the editor's note) , so with the incentives offered by GM - it was off to the internet and the pavement. First off, this is a nice car for the money. Saturn dosen't make a poor man's starter model car anymore so the divorce is final there. Chevy still makes a bang for the buck car here. And it kind of looks like a ""little Vette""   Drives great. Comfortable. Stylish. ",Great looks inside and out. Super comfort for a large driver. Feels expensive. Free 3 months of XM radio which finally solves my anger with commercial radio formats to boot! Great white color match from body to bumpers. Spoiler is right on the mark for setting off visual interest. ,Could use power windows as a standard base model feature like my wife's base model Mitsu 05 Lancer and power door locks. But I guess that's marketing stuff. I'll deal with the crank windows for such a modest pricetag. 
4.75,2008 Chevy Cobalt Coupe LT ,Pam ,01/24/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Even though I've only owned my Cobalt for 33 days, its performance and appearance(Revolution Edition Package) is outstanding. I'm 4'9"" and i have the seat all the way up, which puts me very close to the airbag should it go off I'll be in big trouble. The acceleration outdoes my previous vehicle, which was a 2005 Trailblazer LS 4-wheel drive. I own a 2.2L DOHC 4 speed automatic,not a 5M.","I love the white racing stripes on my black cCobalt. Also that it came with OnStar the rear spoiler, 16"" wheels, chrome exhaust tip","If you're going to produce a ""Special Edition"" really make it special, i.e. leather interior, sunroof, stylish wheels instead of factory stock, tint the windows, put performance tires on instead of standard one's(I bought new,better performance tires) at a reasonable price."
4.875,Sport ,JohnS ,01/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"So far, so good. Like other reviews, I am also pleased with the leg room in this car for the driver. The back seats have little room when the seat are all the way back though. However, this car ended up being perfect for me. Although the sport costs a bit more, it was well worth the upgrades: better stereo, wheels, tires, sunroof, auto-gnition, etc. Acceleration is great too.","Information controls, traction control, room for driver",Trunk control from inside vehicle
4.875,Great Car for the Money,Christian ,01/02/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The performance of the car is great. Handling is also great for an economy car, specially compared to the previous year and competitors.  This car will be excellent for autocross.",The pioneer sound system. Performance. Handling,"After GM changes on the Malibu, I think the Cobalt looks could definitely improve. Interior looks good except for the seats, again could be better."
4.25,Seems great so far,sdencar ,12/24/2007,,,4,5,4,4,,5,4,4,4,"Great car after only 2 days. I'm 6'3"" and this is the only car in the price class that I can comfortably fit in. Merges onto the highway very well, even from uphill on ramps. Very little room for rear seat passengers. Cheap plastics inside, but you get what you pay for in that area. I haven't ridden in the passenger seat, but my 5'10"" girlfriend said it's plenty comfortable.",2.2 liter engine with good acceleration. Good for a tall person.,Arm rest between the front seats in the manual transmission model.
4.875,Bang for the buck,Gregg ,12/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Excellent car for the price.  My son bought this vehicle to replace a 10 year old Saturn.  I was impressed with the performance, styling, and safety features of the Cobalt.  This may not be one of the ""in"" Japanese sport cars, but my son is getting a lot of comments about the car.  The best part is that he can afford it. ",Fit and finish is excellent.,"Move the inside door locks forward on the door.  You have to reach in front or behind the seat to unlock the door.  Lose the XM radio, not worth it. Wheel covers on LS model a bit cheap looking."
4.875,Amazing Car,Vilkacis ,12/10/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I absolutly love my 08 Cobalt LS, I know its the cheap version, not the sport but its a very nice and fun car, especially since mine is a 5 speed manaul.  Also very easy to work on and to mod.","The 2 doors, simple dash. Shows oil life and tire pressure. Built in XM radio. Huge trunk. Lots of leg room",Make the SS cheaper!
4.75,2008 Cobalt LT,Mike Nug ,11/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,I bought this over the Corrola and Civic. My last tank of gas averaged 34.2mpg. The dash layout at great and the storage bins are layed out well. This is not a speed demon but can handle highway merges fine. ,Left side dash compartment,Needs a dead man's pedal to for your left foot. 
4.875,Great Economy Car,Jerry Cote ,11/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"My Cobalt is an 2008 LS Coupe with a 5 speed. It is the base model that lists at $14,330 and I bought it new for $9989. It is a second car that I use just to get back and forth to work. It is very economical & fairly comfortable. It is quieter than I expected and the stereo sounds nice with the XM radio. Although there is a lot of plastic in the interior, the fit and finish is very good. Overall it is an excellent car. ","Stereo system is quite nice for such an inexpesive car. Fuel economy is good. The digital dash display with fuel mileage, tire pressures, etc. is surprising for the price.",Make a center console available with the 5 speed transmission
4.875,2008 Chevy Cobalt - Great Value,Andy ,09/19/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I chose the 2008 Cobalt LT based on its standard features, fuel economy, and low price. The Cobalt has nice sleek lines and a very simple aesthetic appeal. It's super peppy for a 2.2 liter and has an awesome turning radius. Highway noise is minimal and has a very smooth ride. I'm getting 34 MPG highway and about 26 MPG city.",XM radio - (Standard) Airbags everywhere (8 total) Standard! Fat cushy ergonomic steering wheel,Anti-Lock brakes should be standard on all models.
