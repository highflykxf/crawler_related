The V-6 was well worth the slight cost difference.

Kids enjoy the reclining rear seats and we like having a 3rd row seat when needed.

","Even with a set of Michelins on it it still has road noise.
Oh well, one day we'll add floor insulation to block the sound.

3.125,It's Different,sshadel ,12/13/2011,,,3,3,3,4,,3,4,2,3,"Pros: looks nice, Fairly good MileageMany cons:When excellerating from stop , can not do it smoothly. You have to push harder on the gas peddle and then the front wheel hop takes over and you are all over the road.Front wheels spin out all the time when starting from stop. Told this is normal with Outlander.I have gone thru 2 sets of tires now (Rotate every 6000 miles to try to save them), but 3rd set is needed and only have 70000 miles on Outlander. (Last SUV Santa Fe had70000 miles on 1st set of tires). I canÂ’t let my 17 year old drive it because of the wheel hop. Also radio is nuts.You turn on and 5 to 10 seconds later it comes on. You go from AM to FM or Vice versa,it takes 5 to 10 secondes to change over.(Was also told that is normal). As you ease into a turn and begin toaccelerate the steering wheel will not begin to return by itself you have to pull it back and sometimes jerk it back .(Also told this is normal).Will have to get rid of shortly to get soemthing My 17 yr old can drive.

4.75,Great Car,nagilbaz ,12/12/2011,,,5,5,3,5,,5,5,5,5,"We bought the Outlander in late 2007. The car has not had any problems so far despite the fact that it has been in major accident. I have read most of the reviews pointing to the fact that the interior has problems with the plastic parts and there is poor paint job, which is susceptible even to minor scratches and dents. Well it is absolutely true. Nevertheless, this is the great car and a great helper. We moved several times and overloaded it with furniture and other household items. It did well. Anyway the Outlander does not claim to be a luxurious SUV and saves you a lot of money over the time. ","I like driving with open windows to listen to the brutal sounds of its V6 engine. There is also CD changer for six CDs. I was disappointed with its hands-free system, however. B the way if you have kids, the upholstery will be ruined completely. It does not handle stains well. There are versions with leather seats. I would go with that. ",
3.5,Bad Paint on Mitsubishi Outlander!,kathy ,07/22/2010,,,3,3,3,4,,4,4,3,4,"I have had this car for 2 years and can accurately review it now. I have several complaints. 1-The paint and body quality is terrible.It looks like I've been in a hail storm from the side. I have had cars for 6 years that didn't have as many dings and marks as this car does. It's a mess. 2-I have found there to be large blind spots on the bottom front windshield corners. I have, on many occasions, just missed pedestrians or cars coming from the opposite corner. The corner joining metal and the rear view mirrors create too large of a blind spot. 3-The interior being black on the red model.  The other choice was light cream (on and SUV?). It is the hottest car I have ever been in.4-Gas mileage",Radio controls on steering wheel. 6 cyl. had good pick-up. Fold down tailgate. ,"Paint & body quality poor. Location of many things on interior, like gas cap release and mp3 port. Two choices for interior - cream and black. Cream demo was already very dirty so chose black - mistake - WAY too hot.

This car is not even 6 months old and it looks like every kid in the neighborhood has been throwing rocks at it. There also is a body shape design flaw that allows road debris to sand blast the front of the rear wheel fender.

I was hoping for a little better gas mileage than it gets in the winter but as the weather warms up, it seems to be improving and I have gotten up to 27 mpg on the highway in 2wd.

Wanted to stay under $30k fully loaded.  Walked out at $27,255 with 0% financing for 60 months (rather than another $2000 off) - approx. $1,500 below invoice.  Sticker on car was over $31,000 MSRP.

With the luxury, navigation and sun and sounds packages, the vehicle is simply awesome.  Even during the break-in period, the gas mileage has been impressive.

It doesn't lull you to sleep and since I drive a lot I need to be awake.  Gas mileage varies and so far best is 25 mpg in 2wd then 24 in 4wd.  My XLS drives fine especially in the messy snow, wet and ice we've had this winter in NJ.","The 220 hp and 204 lb of torque move this thing very nicely.  Comfortable on long trips, looks like it cost more, features both standard and optional let priced fairly.

I kept coming back to the Outlander for its combination of performance and utility, its value, and its unique features (hard drive nav, paddle shifters, tailgate). I am very happy with my choice.

Exhaust noise is nearly imperceptible. ","Smooth powertrain, looks, flexible 4WD system, paddle shifters, nice cargo space within reasonable vehicle size.

I own a 2003 CRV and let me tell you this one is a keeper, as soon as we are done paying for the outlander it's out of here.

I am not disappointed.  Although the 4 cylinder lacks initial get up and go power, once its going the Outlander provides a very smooth, sporty, fun drive.  Having driven a Landrover before, I am loving the fuel economy! I'm averaging about 24 mph in the city, on a recent 8 hour trip I averaged about 32 mpg/hwy.

3.75,2008 SE new car comments,Darrell ,09/06/2008,,,5,5,5,2,,3,3,3,4,As for the new 2008 SE Outlander this one is a disappointment. Sluggish off the line. Yes it is a 4 cyl. But no low end torque to speak of. The CVT is my first and am not impressed in one area. Slowing down it feels like the brakes are being applied.  My first Mitsubishi with mechanical problems from day one. Turning left a clank. Same for turning right. Rear end screech when backing. Knocking noise mid vehicle. The dealer said they could not hear the clanking so did nothing. How about putting it up on a rack and turning the wheels? Said the screeching was the brake rotors. Normal. A first for me on any Mitsubishi. Average fuel consumption is not what we want. We want exact MPG.,"Style of outside and inside. Impressive to look at. Gets noticed. Vast change from the prior Outlanders. Nice light display showing useful data. Appealing SUV that draws looks. The SE is very sporty but the 18"" tires take extra effort when turning. ",Seats are to hard. After 10 minutes a cushion is needed. Boster in the seats is badly needed. Loud roar of the 4 cyl. on my SE is very noticeable. Give it some low end torque. Yes I know a 4 cyl. is just that. But tweakng the next year's model will help. Power boost for steering would be very helpful.
5,Excellent SUV,cme4brain ,08/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I researched all similar SUV's- CR-V, RAV4, Forester, Santa Fe, and this is by far the best.  The closest SUV to the Outlander is the Subaru Forester, but it is nowhere near as sporty, and has only a 4-speed transmission!  I traded my Mercedes C240 and could not be happier. I am getting 26.3 mpg driving to work (mainly highway)- more than I got with my small Benz!  The CR-V is too econobox, the RAV4 has no nav nor shiftronic transmission, the Forester is too soccer mom/housewife.  Both the CR-V and RAV4 A/C is poor- can't cope with our heat!  Reliability of Mitsu is outstanding for this model, could not be happier.  As with my four prior Mitsubishis, your value for what you pay is incredible","Fuel economy, interior room, 3rd seat, six-speed paddle shifters, awesome Fosgate stereo, A/C is ice cold, fit and finish seem great.","Sun visors need to be lighted and not so cheap appearing, needs rain-sensing wipers, needs automatic-on-off headlights, NAV should be 3-D instead of 2-D."

It's a blast to drive, comfortable, great handling, sporty.  Lots and lots of car for the money. I got mine with all the features, 30GBHDD, DVD player/Nav system, sun roof, Rockford Fosgate sound system, Blue Tooth, and still payed thousands less than I would have for a RAV-4 or CR-V with comparable options. I'm very pleased with the gas mileage.  I actually got as much as 32mpg on a recent cross country trip.  I average between 25-30 mpg (most of my driving is highway miles).  I like the fact that I don't see many on the road.  It feels large (I feel safe driving it) but also sporty at the same time.","Just about everything! Sound system ROCKS! (you can crank it up as loud as your ears can stand it and there's still no sound distortion); tailgate; bluetooth, Nav system; 30GB/HDD, gas mileage; interior/exterior styling; tons of storage; handling.","Nothing worth mentioning.  I'm very, very happy! If it continues to perform as it has (and I suspect it will), I will become a loyal Mitsubishi customer."
4.625,A Very Good Car!,Stephen ,07/30/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I'm from the Philippines, where the xls is known as the ""gls sport"". It's a nice cuv, with good suspension. The roads here are not too great, but after a long drive, I don't feel beaten up. Also looks good, & people turn whenever I pass by. The car's sound system is also good, and I don't have to buy anything extra just to enjoy my cd's. A lot of new friends are impressed by the exterior & interior looks of this car. It was a toss-up between this and the forester, and i have not regretted my decision in choosing over this one. the fuel consumption is ok, esp on long drives.","the rockford fosgate sound system, the dashboard, the paddle shifts; and the way the back door opens.",gas mileage - i wish it could be more than 17 mpg/city. the Philippine market outlander doesn't have the 30 GB HDD - wish they can incorporate it here. how about h.i.d. for both high & low beams?

5,Special Edition means just that.,John Crocker ,07/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We have had our new Outlander SE 4WD for exactly one month and close to 2000 miles now with absolutely no problems.  The number one priority for ourselves, and many other drivers right now, is fuel efficiency. The Outlander has delivered just what it promised with a mixed city / local driving average of around 25 MPG. For a vehicle that size and weight, sometimes carrying 2 - 4 people, that figure is more than acceptable to me and I feel it may improve even more when the engine is completely broken in. Can't wait to check it out on an interstate road trip.  With good fuel mileage and the rest of the package working flawlessly, I'd rate the Outlander as a smart choice. ",I would say it's the keyless entry system. It may sound gimmicky but it's nice to just slip that remote in your pocket and not have to ever take it out to start or lock the vehicle.  Bluetooth hands free phone system is very nice also.  Top-notch radio and CD player system.,Not being an expert I can't really think of any offhand. As the car sits right now I'm totally happy with it.  Nice to have something a little different from the pack. Plus it's got a very good standard warranty package also.
5,Where have they been hiding this car?,Edward ,06/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Almost made a big mistake by looking at the CR-V, RAV-4, Kia Sportage, Hyundai SantaFe and making a decision then on which one to buy. Fortunately I drove by the Mitsubishi dealer and decided what the heck, I will see what they have. The Outlander is roomier, just as comfortable and has more standard features for a better price. Was equally surprised when I found out that Mitsubishi has the same 5yr/60K bumper to bumper warranty and 10yr/100K Powertrain as Kia and Hyundai do. ","Comfortable seats, plenty of room and loaded with high tech gadgets at a price that won't break your budget. Great 5/60 and 10/100 warranty",Some parts of owners manual are difficult to understand. I mentioned this to service adviser and he agreed. Apparently its the whole Japanese to English translation thing..
4.125,Keeps Locking UP,Donna ,06/29/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,I've had the OUTLANDER long enough to put 6500 miles on it. I love the getup and go it has. Love the handling and the comfort it offers. The center armrest isn't very workable and the driver's side cup holder next to the window broke the first time my knee hit it. I've had a big problem with the steering wheel locking up. This is Saturday night and I'm stuck at the house because the steering wheels locked and I cannot get it to unlock.,Sound system and power coming from the six cyl engine.,Arm rest and steering wheel locking mechanism.
4.875,Sleeper SUV of the year,DD ,06/27/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After gas hit $4+ we decided a big SUV was no longer an option for us and traded our Mitsubishi Montero Limited. After driving an Outlander demo for the weekend, we picked an XLS (need 3rd row seats) and had them add dealer installed leather.  This allowed us to forgo the forced combo pkgs and pick the primary features we wanted.  Having driven large SUVs for many years and having a Honda Accord for our ""other"" car the Outlander is a pleasant complement to our family's fleet.  We enjoy the overall stability, quality feel, and overall look of the car.  Before you buy an SUV you owe it to yourself to drive one of these.","Leather interior really dresses this up, great gas mileage, nice stereo, roomy interior, responsive feel, and the fact that's it's not as common like some other major SUVs.",Wish they would have painted the front lower valance to match the exterior paint.  Offer running boards as a factory option.   Needs a telescoping steering wheel.
4.5,So Far So Good,cbk2000 ,06/26/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,"Just bought a base XLS less than a week ago.  So far, I really like it.  Very roomy, drives and shifts very smoothly.  Very good handling.  Love the paddle shifters.  Good storage up front, too.  Waiting to see how gas mileage really is and whether I need to protect doors and rear fenders from front tire splashes.","Paddle shifters, FAST key system, Bluetooth phone system.","XLS should have the same upgraded cloth that SE trim has.  It's a lint and hair magnet.  Also, XLS should have power front seats standard.  A factory running board option would also be nice."
4.375,Great Car dont overlook it,cs ,06/25/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"So I drive a ton, and I mean a ton 25k per year.  This car is a daily commuter for me.  Why do I love it?  The car is just has everything I need.  Killer stereo, great seat comfort, easy to drive, even the stock tires have worn well.  Easy and affordable to maintain and it takes 87 gas with no issue.  I get 25 mph in my daily L.A. fwy/traffic commute which is pretty good. Great NAV sys, as well as a hard drive that records my cds automatically.  Environmental stats, and a calendar that reminds me of birthdays. Heated seats, solid control, good ac, wipers work well, brakes are solid.  For what you get this car is clearly the best value in the crossover SUV market.  Take a look, you wont be sorry.","6 speed transmission, gets great mileage an the paddle shifters are just awesome.

4.5,Best Features for the Price,Sean R ,06/02/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,5,4,"I've had my Outlander XLS for almost a week now.  I compared it to the Escape/Milan, Nitro, CX-7, and a few others.  For the price you pay, this truck has some nice features.  The FAST key is one of the coolest things.  It allows you to lock/unlock, and start your truck without ever pulling the key fob out of your pocket.  Great idea! The nav/stereo system is nice and easy to operate, and loud when you need it. Bluetooth hands free for the cell is a nice touch.  Rear seats not only slide forward and back, but also recline. Plenty of room all around, and I'm 6'3"", 240.  Engine power is just fine, and in-town mileage has been at 20 mpg so far.  No telescoping steering wheel, though.","-FAST key system -Navigation -Rockford Fosgate stereo has some kick to it -Hard drive on stereo stores a ton of songs -Very good MPG for a SUV -Sporty looks and interior-doesn't feel as stale as the Escape, or as cheesy as the Nitro. -Plenty of cup holders and storage","-Add telescoping steering wheel, a +/- speed button for cruise control.  -Advertising is misleading:  says fog lights are standard with XLS.  Be warned:  if you want the HID headlamps, this cancels out the fog lights."
4.625,Great Buy,Norsekid ,05/20/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This vehicle is a ""sleeper"". Very sophisticated drivetrain, did I mention a 6 speed transmission? Tight handling, pretty quiet tires, could be better. Killer upgraded stereo, heated leather seats and the rear hatch has a lower section that drops down if you unlatch it. Great for sitting down to take off you boots, etc. Gas mileage is ""foot"" sensitive. Still trying to figure where it is but seems to be around 20 mpg city and some highway. ","Drive train, stereo/Sirius for 6 months, rear hatch drop down, handling.",I would add a body side molding to help avoid parking lot dings. I am thinking of buying a second one.
5,Most bang for the buck,gopher ,05/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Most bang for the buck. Title says it all. I never thought I'd find an SUV with great towing power for such a budget price.

Had hesitation problems but service bulletin cured that. On road trip car is outstanding just sit back and put on Cruise and front wheel drive (28 mpg) around town not impressed with mpg or noisy motor, like all available features (best bang for buck). I have had no problems with this vehicle at all, what you see and hear when you purchase is what you get. I was rearended at 40 mph (car stops on a dime) and lower tailgate still opened, car took impact really well. My main pet peeve is the interior fit and finish are starting to look sloppy/lazy.

It has a lot of pick up for a 4 cylinder, like the braking, pretty smooth ride, like the big tires. Amazed at the gas mileage, I was used to driving an SL1 Saturn. Some days I average 30 miles to the gallon, never less than 25.  I really can't say enough good things about it.","Beautiful exterior, love sitting up high, fairly comfortable ride, great radio and CD.  Have the convenience package and I really like that.

5,Great compact SUV and great value!,cooljw ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I considered all the other compact SUVs out there including the RAV4 and CR-V before choosing the Outlander. The Outlander definitely has the others beat on price, styling and overall utility. Plus itÂ’s a great value and costs thousands less than a comparably equipped RAV4 or CR-V.

The 'Lander is a much more wieldy tool in traffic, goes and stops much better, and uses regular gas (the Montero needed premium). I've taken one thousand mile road trip, and the greater economy was much appreciated.

Everything about this car is exciting - the design, the way it drives, the technology - I simply don't have enough time to play with it all.  If you are searching for an off-brand CUV/SUV that has driving personality, utility AND techno-enhanced design, then the Outlander should be at the top of your list.
