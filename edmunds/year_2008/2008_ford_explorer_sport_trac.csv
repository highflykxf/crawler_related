3.625,Ford made this vehicle bland,jahfre ,01/15/2012,,,3,2,4,4,,5,4,4,3,"I bought a Sport Trac in 2001 and drove it for 9 years, putting 260,000 miles on it over the period.That truck was special. Little details and features were well designed and useful...from the tie-down cleats on the bed to the 'bump' feature on the rear sliding window. Dozens of things made those early model year Sport Trac attractive.When I finally wore out the first one I ran to the dealership to get another one. UGH. It is a totally different vehicle...so much worse in so many ways I cannot go into all of them.I use mine to haul rocks, firewood, gravel, etc. The bed was not designed to be used for these things. Awful.",Handling and performance. It feels heavy and lumbering on winding mountain roads where I live compared to the 2001 I had but it does drive nice around suburban neighborhoods and on highways.,Too late.
4.25,Primary Vehicle,J. Hines ,07/02/2010,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,3,4,"Pretty much satisfied with the vehicle.  Only drawbacks are fuel economy, of which I am getting close to 18 mpg around town, and the tire pressure indicator keeps going off.  Have had 2 dealerships look at the tire pressure indicator but no solution yet.","View from drivers seat, comfort, handling","Better location and quality workmanship of cup holders, overhead console storage compartments, and arm rest storage compartment."

Not much had changed on the interior including, entire front display panel and radio. I was disappointed with this until I test dove the Sport Trac.  It's like getting the inside comfort and styling of a luxury car, yet with the manly toughness and sporty styling of a truck. I get 23 mpg on the highway and 17 mpg in town. This is slightly better than my previous F-150. My family and I really enjoy going places in this remarkable vehicle. ","Performance,Overall Styling and Family Comfort","MPG & Truck was sold with GoodYear Fortera Tires. These tires now have nearly 20,000 miles on them and will need to be replaced in about 5,000 from now. These are suppose to be 50,000+ mile tires. This is the biggest disappointment so far.

4.75,goodbye bowtie,okie45 ,06/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5," Bought the last 2008 adrenalin the dealer had and so far i'm very impressed. Got every option and colorado red paint with 20'' wheels.  With only 1000 miles so far I really like the ride and handling of this truck. Its a little underpowered even with the v8 ( maybe thats because my other car is a z28 with an LT1) It looks alot faster than it is. A great looking truck that has everyone asking ""what model is that ??,,""did it come new like that?"". Smooth as silk ride and drive with decent milege from a 4500lb truck (16.9 mpg so far) definately a head turner. At 46 ive had a lot of cars and this one is up top of the list.",  the SYNC cool and love the adrenalin package,"  differant voice options for the sync, she sounds to much like my wife LOL"
4.875,We are impressed more each time we drive,FoggHornn ,02/21/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Got a fantastic deal on the adrenalin model at Christmas. Had Acuras since 1989, but they were not motivated to sell me a vehicle. Brand loyalty meant nothing to them. We enjoy sitting higher when driving. This truck provides a tremendous sense of security in winter driving situations. The 6-speed tranny is smooth and the V8 is very flexible. The independent rear suspension gives a much more impressive ride over rough roads compared to the Chevy Silverado I rented last year for a weekend. Fuel economy so far is acceptable at 15-20 mpg in winter driving. I'm expecting a seasonal improvement to 20-26 mpg when the weather warms up, like my Acura TL does. We enjoy driving this truck immensely. Recommend just adding sunny days and a favourite recreational activity. This truck has style, power and tremendous versatility. Big grins. It's a keeper.","Sunroof, V8, 6-speed auto,awesome stero package with Sirius Sstellite radio, SYNC with bluetooth phone, AWD, Adrenalin styling package with 20"" wheels & Pirelli tires, black leather interior, white suede exterior, electric rear window, hard tonneau cover, class 3 tow package, pickup box",Heated seats and mirrors were not available until 2009 model. 
4.5,So far so good,xero2099 ,02/07/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"Have had my Trac since August, have loved it so far. Had a Focus before this so  there was a little bit of an adjustment period but it's all been good. Love the rubberized floor. It's a breeze to clean. Could have done a lot better with the MPG though  ",The rubberized floor on the inside makes it a snap to clean after snow or if you were out in the mud. The bed even though on the small side has held up very well with all the stuff I toss into it,Most of this car is fiberglass. Would like  the shifter to be on the steering column. Would love to see different interior colors. The brown gets dirty too fast
2.5,Embarassment to America,scubajeff ,01/16/2009,,,1,4,2,4,,4,1,3,1,"What in the heck are they thinking in Detroit? Ford has been making trucks for well on 100 years. This is the most uncomfortable truck I have ever been in. This truck is provided as a work vehicle and I hate to get in the thing. The YukonXL I was in previously was by far a more comfortable, good riding truck. This SUV, while being a smaller body, has no excuse not to have a more comfortable and well designed seat at least. Then add the cheap cheap leather, and interior which looks like its a year old already, and I can see why the big three reps apologized for building cheap cars. This wasn't cheap, but it sure is built that way. Fit and finish? What a joke. Never again Ford. Never.",Power.,"Interior quality, seat design, r&d and get the thing out there to test it with real people and not computer models."
4.5,Adrenalin can't be beat & turns heads,DrDon ,12/30/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"I couldn't resist buying a brand new showroom leftover Adrenalin & taking advantage of Ford employee discounts. Traded in a 05 Silverado SE Special Edition Extended Cab and there's simply no comparison in quality - Ford wins hands down. The ride is tops, the look is...well, the Adrenalin turns heads everywhere I've gone. Definitely buy the Navigation option with Sync. Makes a world of difference. Black interior is nice but I would've enjoyed a two-color treatment. Still, this car/truck combination is versatile, sporty, smooth, cool & a real winner. Might be the best vehicle I've ever owned - and I've had many.","Navigation, smooth ride, ground effects treatment, sunroof, power rear window & 20"" wheels (it could also easily handle 22""). I like the full four door cab plus the advantage of a pickup bed, even if a short one.","Wish all Sports Tracs, incl. Adrenalin, had the rear back up camera which is being put into the F150s. But nothing in the world is perfect. The fancy, eye-catching Sport Trac Adrenalin is car-show ready, direct from the factory. Good show Ford!"
4.75,Perfect so far,PaCOP ,12/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I have this vehcle about a month and thus far it is great. The Sport Trac seems the perfect fit as I wanted something between a full size pick up and a compact. The bed's a little small but still capable of hauling 4x8 sheets when fitted with a couple 2x4 in the notches in the bed. The interior is roomy and comfortable. Not extravagant but I am still satisfied. MPG could be improved, so far getting 16mpg but would prefer if Ford could up that to 20. The V6 has been adequate and the 5 speed auto is smooth. satelite radio is nice. The molded bed w/ compartments and tiedowns is well designed. Overall look is very appealing.  ","I like the overall appearance as well as the interior room. Versatlity of having the bed is nice. Satellite radio is nice, rides good. Dark blue is nice color. ","MPG could be improved. I'm getting 16 mpg. Weird inside door handles. Side mirrors could be slightly larger. Console storage just a bit wider to fit a CD. Garage opener holder is wasted space. Tonneau cover should be easier to remove. Black cloth interior should be all black, not two tone with camel"
4.5,Ford Convert,WMcClure ,11/11/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"I've never been a Ford fan, always preferred GM or Toyota products. Test drove this and was impressed with how solid it felt and the quietness of the cabin. ","Quiet, solid, plenty of room, good power.","Better stereo, blue instead of green displays, and put on column shifter to free up space below."
5,Would've never thought it,rd2007 ,08/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was a Ford hater and never would have considered buying one. I was initially looking at the Avalanche and while reading reviews I noticed some positive ones for the SportTrac. I went to the dealership and was also looking at the Expedition, but they could not get me the numbers I wanted so I decided to try out the SportTrac. I took a drive in it and was amazed at how well it drove. It's quiet, smooth, and the V-8 has plenty of go in it. So far I have had it for two months and it's been perfect. My mileage has been about 15-16 overall, but that is mostly because I tend to have a little fun now and then. It's the same mileage my CX-7 got and that thing didn't have anywhere near the room.","V-8, tires, smooth suspension, rugged yet sophisticated looks.","There's a little bit of creaking, some of the plastic is cheap looking, and the cover for the bed should not be that expensive. I was thinking it would be about the same price as the option on the sticker, but it was almost double the cost."
5,Excellence From Ford,Willis ,06/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded in a 2004 F-150 and got 2008 Limited Sort Trac, V8,  4X4, limited chrome and electronics. Ford couldn't have done a better job of putting a vehicle together. Great power anywhere you need it, I am am happy with my mileage compared to my F-150 V8 5.4. Getting 22mph on highway. Very smooth ride, If you're looking for something like this no other manufacturer can even come close to the quality and comfort of the Sport Trac.","Bed cover, 6 speed trans,18"" standard tires on Limited.

4.875,Just the right size truck,Sam ,06/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I will always need some type of truck for hauling and have liked the Sport Trac since the first ones came out. The addition of the V8 and IRS on the latest model was the clincher. Truck has a very comfortable interior. Outstanding ride and handling. I love the excellent overall quality, it is very quiet with no rattles or squeaks. For someone that does not a 6' or 8' bed length, this truck fits the bill. Tows a 5000 boat very nice and with the traction control, goes up the slipperest ramp with ease. With the sales incentives and rebates, the price simply cant be beat for a fun full featured, loaded 4 door truck.","V8 power, Sync and overall styling",6 speed manual would be a very nice option on all models and a supercharger option for the 2008 Adrenalin.
4.875,Ford is moving forward,michael G ,05/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I had read a lot of reviews before I made a purchase. Allow me to say Ford had done a great job. I put black leather in this vehicle as well. Sync and convenience pack came with it along with the tow. First, I drove the kids to see family 3 hours away and it drove smooth. The passing issue with power-hey guys turn the OD switch off , that will give you more power, not that I had a problem. No carpet. Excellent, easier maintenance. Plastic inside. Great. Now I dont have to use ""Armor All""-easy to clean with warm water.  A sync syst-with Sirius. Let's roll!  A class 3 tow package-take the jet skis to the lake up to 5000lbs w/ elec. Come on! Gas, Ford could do better. ","Sync. No hands to talk. Tow. Great idea! Quality tires and suspension looks great with durability. 6 airbags, appreciate the safety you guys put into it. Good call!

2.75,SporTrac,Jared ,03/30/2008,,,2,4,4,4,,1,3,1,3,"Bought the vehicle out of necessity. We just had a new baby and needed bigger trunk space. Unfortunately, I traded quality for price and ended up paying for it in the end. Good power in the lower gears, so, you'll get going pretty quickly, but then the power drops off quickly once you get into the upper gears.  I always had an extremely hard time passing anyone above 50MPH without hammering down the gas pedal.  A lot of plastic interior, comfortable seats for short drives, but horrible on your lower back on drives of 3 hours or more. SYNC feature is horrible!  Even speaking slowly and clearly, I'd have to repeat myself 2-3 times for the system to recognize what I was trying to say.",Nice exterior body style. Tonneau cover is excellent ,"More powerful V6.

5,My Dream Truck,Woodchopper ,03/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had many vehicles, of all sorts.  I have been looking at the Sport Trac since it's debut in 2001, but wanted more than the 4.0 litre engine. Now with the V8 4.6 my dream truck is a reality, and the wait was worth it, more robust frame & suspension (IRS), better looks, plus overall refinements. I am over 6'1"", comfort is great. I like the door handles (placement, appearance) and have no issue with the door pulls, seats, or anything else. The rubber floor covering is much easier to clean than carpet would be. I trailer two large ATVs at ""highway speeds"", passing & handling is spot on. I am very pleased with my Sport Trac, and have recommended it to others, friends and family included.","The composite box with the three in floor storage compartments plus lockable tonneau cover and tailgate. The 2"" receiver hitch, with 4 & 7 wire connections. Interior comfort and storage, also flat folding rear seats are the best. There is nothing to dislike about the 2008 Sport Trac 4x4 IMHO",This is a four wheel drive truck. If I can get another 4 or 5 mpg out of it then I would gladly rate the 2008 Sport Trac at 10 across the board.
4.625,Ford best for the money,Craig Baber ,02/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"I have had lots of Fords over the years but this is one of the best. I traded a 2004 F150 Crew for this and I am as pleased as punch.  The 4.6 V8 is a power house and delivers basicly the same mpg as the 6.  It is so easy to park, garage friendly (takes less room) is great on the road. It is quiet, ride is outstanding, no need for rails as in and out access is great.  The new Sync by Microsoft and sirus radio makes it a intertainment wonder.  No need for cds as one 2mb in the usb will access hundreds of songs with out worry of storage or scratching of cd.  The vinyl floor is padded and the cab is quiet.  It is a well thought out suv and with current offer of 4000 cash back is a must have.","Sync! Sirius radio, v8 engine, and quality of product.  Standard features and safety features are truly outstanding.",Rear window difogger and link sync to sirus radio. Add options for bed use such as ladder to hitch rack for carring equipment Add abient lighting as available on focus which is real cool.

4.75,Just what I wanted...sort of.,K3 ,02/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"The 2008 Explorer pick-up is perfect for me and my high school aged daughter. I cannot complain about one thing other than gas mileage on the V6. I guess I would have purchased the V8 just to get the six speed transmission if I knew the mileage would not be all that different, although, my five speed seems fine for my purposes and the eight cylinder just added to the cost. My leather interior, the paint and trim are outstanding. Microsoft Sync and Sirius radio combined with the 6 disc changer gives me so much music through the truck's killer sound system that I don't know quite what to listne to sometimes. I love the handling, et. al. Really neat truck for a city boy.","Top to bottom, I like it all.",Gas mileage.

The '08 w/ 4.6LV8 is far superior and fuel economy is 1 mpg less in town than the 6; same on hi-way. The ride is like that of a much more expensive truck and the handling and noise levels are top-notch. Sync system can be a problem at times (mine has gotten stuck in a RING cycle that forced me to pull over, shut everything down and re-start the car.

I don't need to haul large or heavy objects very often, so the small bed works for me. The ride is comfortable and composed. The V6 has plenty of power and everything has been reliable. Ford needs to work on the fuel economy. I am not dissappointed with the mileage, but I think Ford could do better.","Truck bed, mp3 auxillary jack","Better fuel economy, parking brake release is too low on the dash"
4.875,Best of both worlds,Chuck ,01/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded in my '97 Ford F-150, which was the best vehicle I had ever owned.  Needed more family room though.  Drive alot off road so needed a 4WD.  The dealer installed skid plates from Ford and 265/70R17 BF Goodrich Longtrail tires.  Lifts the vehicle over an inch vs. stock tires.  Truck drives like a luxury ride on the road and has handled real off road trails here in Arizona desert thus far with no problems.  It is not the tallest frame for a 4WD, but take it careful and the truck will climb anywhere.  Mileage is okay at 18.5 mpg on highway, and 16.5 city.  ",Exterior design and hard tonneau cover with bed extender are both awesome.  Very quiet and smooth ride.  ,I would have Ford give the skid plates standard for 4WD and make large tires std also.

The Sport Trac did both. I have really enjoyed the ST. I think the 4.0 v6 handles it better than the 4.6 v8 handles the F150. Fuel mileage is avg. about 17, and, with the tailgate down, my Honda Foreman 4wheeler will fit in the back(the side tie downs come in very handy for this. Would definately recommend this vehicle.","Exterior and interior design. Center console mounted shifter, very quiet ride.","The door handles are in a wierd place, but ya get used to em pretty quick.
