2,Beware of numerous potential issues!,Paul Tucker ,10/11/2016,2,2,3,,,1,3,3,3,,,"Let me start by saying this car looks great. It even handles and accelerates great. It has decent interior room (even though the 3rd half-door is a joke). The problem is this car is a potential  money pit. I've spent over $5000 on repairs: timing chain, oil pump, water pump, low engine oil pressure etc...you name it. This Mini is not a durable car, and should never be purchase with more than 50,000 miles. I receive class-action lawsuit notices against Mini on all the issues I've had to deal with almost every three months. Obviously, I'm not the only owner dealing with these re-occurring issues.

Of the 3 the Mini offered the Get-Up-&-Go I was looking for with the ""S"" model.  I test drove both models on the AutoBahn here in Germany.  What really sold me was the turbo, in both 5th & 6th gear the pick up to get around other vehicles was very impressive.

Very comfortable for road trips, with firm seats and real lumbar support with the upgraded upholstery.  It does have a very firm ride, and the sport package is only for masochists.  I plan on switching out the run flats when they wear out with regular tires to ease the bumpiness.  The roads here in Minnesota are bad.  If you can find a twisty road it is sublime.  I test drove all the varieties, and I think the Auto base is a bit underpowered.  The Manual base is ok.  Obviously the S in either version rocks.  But switch the MPH over to the RPM gauge, as I hit 100 when passing without noticing.","The look and feel of the car.  It is a little rally car.  The torgue boost is quite impressive.  The cloth/leather seating is a great deal if you are building your own, as it includes color line and interior surface choice, usually running $500, so it is $500 over that.  And it has Lumbar support.",Choice of run flats or performance tires on S to smooth out the ride.  Put HiFi stereo back in performance package.  Put On/Volume button on the stereo instead of down below.  Make the controls a bit more intuitive.  It needs more storage in center console.  None of these are deal breakers. Love it.

It handles snow really well in Toronto even with stock run-flats. Road feel is great just the way a performance car should be.

The car is very well engineered but had some minor defects when delivered (not a surprise), which are still being fixed after 5 weeks (a surprise).

Sport mode adds to the fun to have ready on power.   Through daily commuting of 75%/25% highway to city, I have averaged 32 MPG with the automatic.  ","Love the performance to fuel milage ratio, 32 MPG average.  Cool rear doors opening, duel sunroofs, and BMW quality through out.   ","My only grip would be the placement of the seatbelt.  Makes it hard to get in and out of rear, and also hard to pull forward at times, as it gets hung up between door and seat. "
5,Clubman worth the extra space!,Tony ,04/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great vehicle. I always wanted a Mini but needed to be able to transport my two boys in the back. The Clubman was the answer. Excellent pick-up; excellent grip; great 6 speed tranny; and you gotta love the barn doors in back. Gas mileage is, of course, great; 28 city and 33 highway. The ride is also much more secure and settled on the hwy with the longer wheelbase vs the Cooper coupe. ","The sport package/S engine combo; slick 6 spd; the looks (lightning blue with silver C pillars); cool barn doors; helpful 3rd door; Double pane sunroof; the MINI experience, tough to describe unless you're an owner!",More storage space (I'm having the center armrest installed next week)
