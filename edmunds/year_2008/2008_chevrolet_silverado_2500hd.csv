It has a 6 year, 100,000 rust / corosion warranty. But the service manager, Bill, decided they wouldn't cover it - no reason, just wouldn't. I called Chevrolet and was told its the dealers choice to cover warranty stuff or not - the company rely's on them! Really!

In one year of use the bed is pushing out and cracking along the sides at the end of the tool box. I've own two Dodge 2500's and never had the problem, dealer states the problem as having to much weight. I think Chevy needs to build a better bed for the 2500's for guys  who use their trucks for work. Also took the truck in three times to have interior tighten up do to rattles.

5,Great truck,Neil ,09/24/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I chose this model as it could be converted to also use CNG and now I get about 20 mpg (CNG) on the freeway at 65 - 70 mph. With gasoline it would be 3 mpg better but CNG is $1.53/gal I use it in the mountains (+9000 feet) and it just goes anywhere.  Upgraded to 285/75/16 tires for a snowplow (clearance) - Plow works fine with the 160 amp alternator.  Replaced the catalytic converter in first year but otherwise no problems and I now have 34K miles and 2 years on it. I enjoy driving this truck. Its comfortable and rides easy.

Everything rattles, ride is so rough and loud.  My 02 1500 5.3 L had more power and got same mpg pulling as 08 2500hd but way less empty.

I have not had any major problems with this truck what so ever. Minor problems I have had are the belt noise due to the power steering pulley misalignment and the rear tire wear due to factory door sticker calling for 70psi for the rear tires. Dealer took care of all and installed two new tires on my truck. Dropped rear tire pressure to 60psi. No more wear, Love the 6.6 Duramax with the Allison. What a combination. Tons of torque, great performance for a diesel, and quite. Average fuel mileage 18.5 back and forth to work and 22.4 on my last road trip.(12/09).

I'm towing a lot more now and I needed something with a little more umph.  This truck has it.  I thought about the diesel for this truck but I opted for the 6.0 because you never know when the prices are going to sky rocket again.,"I love the fact that the trailer brake box is built into the dash.  So, no ugly box hanging down to knock your knee on.  The second fact is the six speed automatic.  I like you can put it into manual mode to shift it like a manual for the steep hills.

2.375,What a piece of junk,nick barta ,03/09/2009,,,2,2,1,1,,4,3,2,4,This is by far the worst vehicle I have ever owned.  The interior started rattling after 2500 miles. The chrome on the grill peeled after one winter in Montana.  The new exhaust system is a joke. I had this truck in the dealership eight times in the first six months of which two required towing it there.  The tranny fails to shift out of 5th gear after busting through heavy  snow drifts.  Off road traction is terrible this truck won't drive through 3 inches of snow without putting it in 4wd. Fuel economy is decent when it's empty. It gets 14 to 18mpg at 75mph.  A light 16ft interstate cargo trailer will bring that down to about 9mpg.  My truck is for sale and you couldn't give me another one,love the power! Integrated trailer brakes-  why was this not done years ago?,Build a truck! this is a 4wd luxury car with an 8ft bed not a truck.

Did my Consumer review research and found Chevy diesel rated the best all round of the Big 3 for 08'! Can't even complain about the mileage. Adverage of 18 mpg, 21 mpg at 55-60 crusing the interstate (unloaded). Love how the Alison tranny grabs hold of the engine when the tow mode is turned on and sounds awesome.

I traded in my 07 1500 LS Crew Cab with a 4.8L because it didn't tow my trailer as good as I wanted. After dirving this truck for a week it flat out performs my 07, in every aspect. You can feel the power difference in the 08. Gas mileage has been good for me as well. I averaged 18.3 on the highway last night going 75-80 for 300 miles round trip. I guess with some mods it should get better. Not a fan of the smaller looking tires on this truck. As big as this truck is you would expect tires that fill the wheel wells. Again this is an excellent truck all around Great job GM.","Power! Interior is not too shabby, have a little better than a 2LT but not as much as an LTZ",Tire size this truck demands bigger tires. Seats hurt my back but I guess I just need to adjust them to me (same as the 07 1500 was). OnStar offers hands free phone for a fee.

Sunroof definitely better too. My only complaint is the new emmissions equipment really chokes this thing and kills mileage; I get 14 in town and 18 highway with some modifications. For those wanting a better ride, try a front leveling kit with longer shocks; it helps tremendously. Also try a cold air intake and bigger exhaust; helped my mileage alot. ","LTZ interior, navigation, sunroof, Duramax/Allison combo unbeatable. ","Figure out a newer, better emission system. Front fender openings too small for those wanting to add a larger tire size. Maybe offer rubber floor with LTZ package. "

Mileage has been OK so far, well within my expectations. Also, very pleased with the looks of the truck.",The interior and ride was what sold me. The diesel can pull more than anything I will ever need to pull. And it's a very queit motor once warmed up.,"Being picky, the truck should come standard with running boards/steps. I've put on some after markets that look great. The bed rails should also have protection. Again, after markets look great. Also, the interior door panels are just a little plasticy.

I get 14 mpg city A/C on (with lots of idling and sitting at lights), 19.5 highway (70 to 75 mph).  Not bad for a vehicle that weighs this much and can tow 15,400 lbs. Can't imagine feeding the old gas big block! Ride is a little rough on bad roads because of the heavy duty nature. I'm researching how to change that (airbags, different springs/shocks). With a load, it's perfect.",Without a doubt: Duramax/Allison. This is by far the best light diesel drivetrain on the market. Test drive them all; you'll see. I still have respect for Cummins. None for Powerstroke. My interior is very nice. Wish it had the LT2 cloth but could not live without bench seat in extended cab.,"Wicked quick truck needs better brakes.
