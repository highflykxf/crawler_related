1,Worse car I've ever owned,Tim G ,09/23/2016,2,2,3,,,1,3,1,3,,,So many problems I hope I can remember them all.At 33k miles I started having problems with the vehicle shutting off when trying to accelerate from a complete stop.Not a great problem to have when turning in front of oncoming traffic.After many days Hyundai finally found a pin loose under the dash and also a bad catalytic converter.At 45k the fuel level sensor went bad causing a inaccurate fuel gauge.At 49k a new stalling problem started.When slowing down all the engine and all electrical would shutdown forcing me to drift to the side of road and attempt to restart.That was the last straw in my Hyundai nightmare.I promptly traded the lemon in and couldn't be happier having something reliable now.Will never purchase a Hyundai ever again or suggest buying one to a friend or family member.,,

We had an easy time purchasing the auto from the dealer but the dealer once we went off the lot didn't care what happened after that.  We had two incidents happen as we drove off the lot and one has not been addressed yet by them...  yet they state that the autos go thru a 37 pt inspection.   Will probably not buy from this dealership again, but will definitely buy another Suv like this one as we are enjoying it.",,

I traded in my old 2005 Chevy Aveo for something large enough for my growing family and this car was the first one I saw. So far, we've had no problems. The only thing I noticed was the little skip in the car if you start breaking for a red light.

I purchased it used with 15K miles on it for $17500 and the dealership kept the 100K mile warranty on it. I just recently hit 110K miles on it in early 2016, and I've only had 2 problems with it since purchase. The CD player recently stopped working (stuck CD) and the coolant system blew out and required a complete replacement at 30K (warranty covered). Despite those 2 issues, I'm still in love with this car. I have been with it in Florida driving around the city and frequent tropical storms without problems, it has taken me to Virginia/DC/Connecticut and handled the snow/ice very well (despite being 2WD), and currently is enduring Texas weather without problems.It comfortably fits 4 people (5 if the person in the middle is small).",,

Within 2 weeks I had to spend over $1500 on repairs, and that wasn't the end. The windshield was not placed in properly (apparently a common problem with these cars), causing the passenger side to have a large leak any time it rains. The gas gauge does not read properly, and will say the tank is empty a day after it is filled up. The seat heaters do not work (the passenger button controls the driver seat, and the passenger heater does not work at all). The a/c and heat are on constantly at full blast, there is no way to turn it down or off. I could go on about the problems I have had with this car, and unfortunately Hyundai will  not cover any of the costs to repair these problems. I am counting down the days until I can buy a new one.

2,Nothing but problems,Tessa ,07/13/2015,2,,3,,,2,4,3,3,,,"We have had our 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe for seven years. In that time it has been a very costly car to maintain. Within the first two years we had two major fuel issues, the leather interior started to peel away in areas, a battery that didn't even make the 2 years before dying suddenly and tires that were done long before the warranty. The amount that we would have gotten on the pro-rate for the battery and tires was so minimal that we went outside of Hyundai to replace and got better warranties with longer life.  Within the past year we had a low fuel sensor issue that I have come to learn is not uncommon for Hyundai products and a high ticket repair (over $800). Now its the rack and pinion steering (over $1400).  I'm sure that some owners are fortunate and don't have the lemon issues that we have had.  We have a Honda that is 14 years old have never had these issues.  Having to deal with so many issues I know that I will never purchase another Hyundai automobile. Considering the price that we paid for it, one would think that the quality would be better.",,

A few recalls were taken care of warranty but one major repair expense outside of warranty was the rack and pinion ($1k/incld labor) since it was leaking heavily from the passenger side.  Also, there are traces of oil leaking from the head valve gaskets after 90k.  Regular oil maintenance for both engine and transmission have been done religiously according to recommended intervals.  I'm expecting to pay another $1k @100k for spark plug and valve cover gasket replacement work.

I have owned all types of vehicles and this is by far my favorite in terms of performance and luxury.  My girlfriend has a BMW X3 and the Hyundai compares in terms of luxury and performance.  In fact if you look at the specs the two vehicles are almost identical.  The only difference is the BMW feels ""tighter"" steering wise.  

Overall plenty of power and luxury.  The seats are comfortable and the ride is extremely smooth and quiet.  Getting about 20.7 mpg in primarily suburban driving and over 25 on a long trip to and from the Jersey shore.","The ride, performance, and luxury.  The leather seats are comfortable.

After the recalibration of the SRS PODS system, the Airbag (AIR) warning lamp in the dashboard remained on.The front seat belt tensioner was replaced free of charge, but 9 months later theAIR light came on again and the entire seat needs to be replaced at a cost of $2400 plus tax and labor.I never had any problems with the SRS system until after the recallibration of the SRS PODS system.Prior to this, the transmission and Hydraulic Brake Control Unit were replaced in 2009.

The cargo capacity is outstanding, including generous under-floor storage, the ride is very quiet, the mileage is surprisingly good (no worse than my previous Honda CR-V - a much smaller and noisier vehicle).

It looks great and we've had zero service issues with it thus far.  The only two small issues that we have with it would be the not-too-great gas mileage and a bizarre 'helicopter' type sound in the car if one rear window is open when there are no others open - strange problem, but we quickly learned not to do that!

Even told them that I don't feel safe driving the car, and all they could respond with was ""Well, you have roadside assistance available."" (Not exactly the most comforting thing to hear).

I've had a clunk in the front end going over bumps. I took  it to dealer and was told it was a bushing problem. The didn't seem to have a fix for it.

The interior is really the place of my frustration in terms of rattles (fixed one, but there are many), feedback noise issue (told me it's normal) and seat pocket tears (haven't heard back from dealer yet, it's been weeks) I am concerned that, regardless of the problem, the dealer will passively resist my concerns.

The selling dealer then exchanged all tires with tires from another new Sante Fe and the problem was solved after much time wasted by me. In my judgment, the car should not have been delivered to me with a shimmy which was noticeable. Don't they test drive cars before delivery to the customer?

5,Best Car I Ever Had in 28 Years Driving,satisfied ,07/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've been driving for 28 years and this is the best car I ever owned. It seats 4 comfortably and I can haul a lot of stuff when I put the seats down. Fuel mileage is excellent for a car with this much storage. After reading about terrible problems in the automatic gear shift from 1st to 2nd, I made sure to check this out repeatedly during the test drive. 10 months later, I have zero problems with that or anything else. I got all the upgrades except for the navigation system and the roof rack. I'm thinking of getting one for my wife and get the $3,500 gov't ""CARS"" plan since the MPG difference qualifies. Unless you get a rare lemon, this is really a great crossover.",Ratio of price to storage room and MPG while being able to convert to respectable passenger seating while driving around my baby boomer friends. My 20-something kids are no longer embarrassed by me driving round a Grand Marquis.,Wish I had a connection for an ipod. Probably doesn't so they can sell XM that comes with the sound system. I wouldn't mind having some padding for my left knee when leaning it against the door during long drives. This is an inconvenience with many cars.
4.75,First Hyundai Experience,Tiana ,07/14/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My first time riding in the Santa Fe was actually in a rental.. I'd never looked at Hyundai before but my experience was so nice I ended up purchasing one. It offers an extremely smooth ride, really comfortable, fun and peppy drive, and the console is very stylish! ",The blue lights and stereo...smooth sailing ride!,Better fuel economy. The Santa Fe is a nice looking car but Hyundai should definitely continue to enhance the exterior appearance to better match the inside.

Overall a great vehicle. It is comfortable, spacious, and tows anything I can put in a 4x8 utility trailer. Gas mileage has been about 18 mpg with mostly suburban driving, but I leave it idling a lot for my daughter in the summer. Highway is about 22, but would be a lot better if I could keep it below 80. My wife frequently gets 24-26 on the interstate when she drives. Power is adequate, but not breathtaking. Overall the best value in the 20K SUV price range.","XM, comfort, sunroof, headlights are superb. Silver Blue color. I'm not sure why it was discontinued, but it looks classy. ","Hyundai dealers are shady. I've bought two hyundai's and the dealers are usually the worst for trying take advantage of people. Hyundai should address this, it is a big turn off. Also, Hyundai seems to include less standard features each model year (painted light covers, exhaust tips, etc), bad idea"
5,BEST VEHICLE EVER!!!,Love my Santa Fe ,07/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is our 11th time buying a new vehicle and the first time buying a foreign vehicle.  The Santa Fe is our favorite vehicle ever.  It is fun to drive and very easy to handle.  Even though we live in snowy Minnesota, we opted for the FWD and have had no regrets.  The FWD handled beautifully in the snow and ice last winter.  This vehicle cannot be beat in terms of quality, safety, warranty, price value, and cost to insure.  An added bonus is the great dealership where we purchased it - St. Cloud Hyundai. We'll be back there the next time we need to buy a vehicle.

Also, Hyundai was recommended by other friends who have one. Only issue so far is pulling to left. After two alignments, seems to be okay. Although steering is pretty sensitive. Like all the features, styling, performance (little sluggish in shifting between 1st & 2nd gear) so far, after 2000 miles. CD player is only 1 CD capacity??

3.5,Navigation problematic,KF ,06/21/2009,,,4,4,3,3,,3,4,3,4,The Santa Fe handles very well in the snow and is much better than my other 4 wheel drive. After 8000 miles however the navigation/radio unit went out. Sent it to Hyundai dealer for warranty work and the part is back ordered indefinitely. Reportedly there are 50+ on back order ahead of me so apparently this is not an isolated incident. So I selected this vehicle because of the nav and other upgrades and they are unreliable.

They fixed it. Then this week the engine light and ESC light came on. Called for a tow. They said they'll town to nearest dealer who is 2 hrs away. Called dealer to discuss issue and car rental. Mechanic there treated me like dumb female told me the lights did not mean much. So scared they would not cover costs I canceled tow. Then car died on BUSY hwy 2 days later suffering from same issue.

We might not have ever considered it except we have a 2000 Hyundai Accent that has been fantastic.  This is pretty much my dream car.  It has 99% of the features I really wanted (leather, sunroof, wheel-mounted audio controls, CD/MP3 with changer, blue lights...just missing the auxiliary jack which I hear they now have on the 2009 model).  My husband and I actually mistook it for a Lexus in a Target parking lot a few months after we bought it.  The interior materials are top-notch and I actually like the firm ride.",See above.,"They have already added the auxiliary jack.

4.625,Very Good Vehicle For The Money,Dick Smith ,05/11/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,5,4,"We bought this 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe after a lot of looking at various SUV's.  Our first choice was the Highlander, but they are very high priced.  We ended up with the Santa Fe because it was a lot of vehicle for the money.  About $5,000 cheaper than  a comparable Highlander. We are very satisfied with it.  It is a very nice vehicle in all aspects.  We would highly recommend it to anyone.",Comfort and reliability great so far. Has a lot of pep. Sterio is great and all the features are very nice.,"Haven't found anything, so far, that we would change at this point. At 3,200 miles we are very satisfied."
4.375,Solid choice for the money,Dan ,04/23/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"Hyundai is obviously not Toyota or Honda..that being said the Santa Fe is our third Hyundai SUV and we have never had major issues with any of them.  The ride in this SUV is by far the quietest and most comfortable of other SUVs in ITS PRICE RANGE.  We also have a 2008 CRV and the Santa Fe is a much better pic for highway travel.  Gas mileage on the other hand has not improved from our older Santa Fe. I consistently get 21mpg mixed driving.  You will not get 24mpg on a tank,ever.  On a road trip I managed 23mpg going 70mph.  Our AWD CRV averages 25mpg...then again it's lighter and a 4cyl.  Fit and finish is great; front seat is not good for tall drivers..but acceptable. Trade-in is terrible","fit and finish, road composure and ride noise...or lack there of. blue lighing is different.

Just a months after owning it I had to have the carpet replaced twice and bumper repainted because paint was peeling off. Now after 20K miles the dash is peeling and the leather seats have rubbed down to nothing leaving a rip in the driver seat. I'm 5'4"", weigh 120lbs but they say it's not covered under warranty because I'm not entering my car the right way. The latches on the third row seat broke and had to be replaced.

I've never owned a Hyundai, but they sold me with the massive warranty and assurance program.  I looked at CR-Vs and Escapes, and I found this was a much better priced vehicle for the options I wanted.  It's comfortable and snazzy.  It drives more like an SUV than a zippy car.  Braking distance sometimes sneaks up on you-- I've taken to adding some following distance.  There's plenty of leg room.  I wish there was more headroom in the driver's side.  Anyone more than 6' tall will feel a bit scrunched by the vehicle roof when driving (my boyfriend is 6'2"" and feels the roof is uncomfortably close to his head).","Under-floor storage in cargo area, styling/looks are pleasing, comfortable seating, great seat heaters, reasonably priced, availability of seat heaters/premium features without leather package, 5-year/100K warranty, assurance program if you lose your job","Auto-up on driver's window, MP3 player input on radio, better braking distance (feels too long sometimes), more head room for driver's seat, telescoping steering wheel setting"

The door ajar beeper is way too loud and annoying, and beeps at every little thing. The tiny foot rest to the left of the break pedal is too low and out of the way to use.

4.875,2008 Hyundai Santa Fe Car review,santa fe ,03/27/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I have only had the car for 30 days thus I need more time to see how things work in the long term.  I am very impressed with the ride and the handling of the car thus far.  I have only driven around town but seem to be getting 22 MPG in town.  I am much impressed with the car so far.  The radio and Infinity sound system are the best part of the car.  I have had many compliments on the car in general from other people.,The Infinity sound system,None that I know of.
4.125,Not Impressed so far,JR_Colorado ,03/14/2009,,,5,5,4,4,,3,4,4,4,"With only 600 miles I am starting to feel like this was a bad decision.  Transmission is already acting strange.  It can't seem to find the right gear going up a hill.  Very frustrating.  Dealer says this may be a ""break in"" issue, but I have never had a transmission have a ""break in"" period, so I am skeptical.  installing the roof rack rails was VERY frustrating.  Broke one of the rail covers putting the rails on.  Poorly designed rail system.  What's up with the rear blinkers.  I do not feel safe with blinkers mostly on the side and not in the rear!!!!!  What were their engineers thinking.  I fell for the $3000 REBATE.  I just hope I am wrong about this vehicle.   ",The blue control lights are really cool!  Temp controls work great!  Heated sets are wonderful!  The ride in town is very comfortable.,Put rear turn signals in the REAR where they are suppose to be and make them amber.  Gas mileage could be better.  Transmission should shift better.

The transmission slips, there is a rattling noise coming from the engine, the wheel alignment does not stay in place, gas mileage sucked, and when the kids hooked up there dvd systems or game systems in the back it would cause a frying sound thru the speakers.

We got the premium package, mostly for the heated seats. Everything in the interior is well placed. Power is good enough with the 2.7, but I wouldn't mind a little more. The fact that my wife drives only 2 miles to work really hurts the MPG, but with more highway driving 20+ MPG is easy to do.

The Santa Fe was the absolute worse vehicle I have ever owned and Hyundai is the worse car company I ever dealt with. Transmission was defective and they would not recognize its problems or fix it.

4.75,Even better than I thought it would be!,fwc ,02/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Traded a 99 CR-V EX AWD for this model.  Came with Option Pkg 3, and everything I could have wanted.  Driving on long trips is perfect, good/bad weather makes no difference.  Unflappable road manners.  Hauls everything I want to carry and has more than adequate power.  Fun to drive and does well whether it's Manhattan traffic or cruising the turnpike.

On my trailblazer when I was doing 60 it felt like I was going 30mph Gas Mileage is between 18 and 19mpg and this is mostly all highway, so I am not to impressed with the mpg.

It handles very well in ice and snow with proper driving skills. The downsides are that the gas mileage is not as good as I had hoped, the front seats seam to have a lot of give as you are entering and exiting the car (and I am not a heavy person). I have two chips in the windshield within a year vs. no chips in the windshield of my old Dodge Caravan after taking many heavy hits, and driving the same routes as I do in the Hyundai.

4.625,OCD type absolutely impressed,rozyred8 ,01/15/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Needed a bigger vehicle.  Looked at Toyota Rav4 and Highlander.  Highlander with similar features is outrageously priced while Rav4 has to few features (no nav, etc.) and price too high in comparison of Santa Fe.  CRV too soccer mom-looking for us. I must say I smile every time I get into this car.  The entire dash and fit and finish is beautiful.  (we have black leather w/ black dash)  Blue lights contrast beautifully.  Sound system great, gas mileage similar to what everyone else says...but something to be noted that not everyone says is the quietness of the ride.  My mom has a Lexus 330 SUV and this is MUCH quieter than her car.  Solid ride that makes you feel good to be at the wheel.","Quiet cabin. Dash. Blue lighting. Elevated ride without feeling like you're riding in a ginormous vehicle. Visibility is great out all sides!  Aggressive front/headlights. Solidly built, you can hear it when you close the doors.

(only opinion) Would like to see the back hatch handle disappear up under the license plate like other SUV's. XM radio has a horrible high pitched background noise that needs fixing.

I'm averaging about 16.8 mpg (only 400 miles on the vehicle and nothing but city driving, no hwy miles really).  The torque and hp is a LITTLE low but all that does is teach me to accelerate without a sense of being in a race all the time.  That saves gas anyway so I think it's fine.

My last ride was a beloved 1996 Mazda MPV AWD with 178,000 miles. But blue smoke and electrical gremlins in wet weather required a change. I extensively researched the specs on Edmunds.com of similar vehicles. I wanted a boost in gas mileage over the 15 MPG of my Mazda, with better interior dimensions and comforts.

We liked how the Toyota Rav4 looks, and liked how the V6 handled.  But to get the same options as our SE Santa Fe, we would have had to get a Limited Rav4.  That was almost $6000 more.

It's spacious cabin provides plenty of room and added compartments for the person looking for the mid-size utility vehicle. Add to that, an assortment of models and options available for those looking to customize their vehicle.  It's a bit slow and sluggish on acceleration and could definitely stand to gain more horsepower. However, once up to speed it performs just fine. I'd rate the car an 8 out of 10.

I have only had it for about a month and keep discovering things that impress me. For instance, the gas mileage for highway. level road, 65 mph is up to 30.4 mpg.  And until I drove it in the dark, I did not realize how cool the dash lights and all other lighting on the console, steering wheel and armrests were this cool violet blue.

For a 30,000 auto, you would think they would have put the lights to stay on after you turn off your key. Nope not there ( I was told it did but no it does not) Does not auto lock the doors after you reach the 12 or 15 miles an hour like most cars do. After reading the manual I find out that when you lock in AWD it turns off at 19 miles an hour. I could not believe it so I call Hyundai and they told me yes that it does.  So what is the point in having AWD?  I have had it 5 days now and ready to trade it in. Rides good except the back seat vibrates more than it should.","Stereo, handles the curves wonderfully, even though I had to shift the auto into 3rd gear.

The only complaint I have is with the infinity sound system- I also have the high-pitched whine at lower volumes that others have alluded to. It gets very annoying and the dealer has replaced my entire system to no avail. They seem to think the amp is overpowered for the speakers and causing feedback. At high volume, the sound is great.

We tried the competitors - Rav, CRV, Forester - but the Santa Fe beat them all in our book.  We were hesitant to purchase because of the past unreliable reputation of Hyundai, but took a chance.

There is plenty of room in the second row for 2 adults to sit comfortably and the second row seat backs recline which adds more comfort.  The front seats are great with plenty of leg room and have a plush feeling.  Dash design is nice and the blue  lighting is not as distracting as a green or a red.

2.375,TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS,derrick ,03/19/2008,,,4,4,3,1,,1,4,1,1,"The transmission stinks... period. Going from first to second gear is whatever you want to call it, a slip, hesitation, pause, delay but it is not normal and Hyundai knows about and continues to put a vehicle on the market with this transmission. It ruins the entire driving experience because when its cold, the hesitation is horrible from first to second gear and continues, at a milder rate, even when its warms up. Shame on you Hyundai this is a lemon law issue. ",NONE because of the transmission.,Revamp the transmission and replace it in every 2007 & 2008  as you really did rip off consumers by using a faulty transmission. Hyundai also fabricated its mileage numbers. This car gets an average of 14. 
4.875,Impressed,Ken ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Switched over from a Passat.  Looked at numerous other midsize SUV's.  Santa Fe was the best for our needs at the right price.  No more paying for Premium gas.  Halleluyah!  I was concerned about the reputation of Hyundai.  Not any more.  This car is really a great ride and the exterior design is outstanding.  Handling is great as is roominess/cargo space.  Too bad Hyundai's leasing deals are awful.  I am confident this car would outproduce the Murano and CRV if Hyundai had favorable lease terms.,"Auto Dimming mirror with compass,  Dual AC/Heat controls,  Handling and Safety!","Rear vents should give off same heat as front vents, Bucket seats could be a tad longer for leg support."

4.875,Great Value ,DM126 ,02/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My wife and I spent 2-3 months researching the purchase of a new vehicle to replace our worn-out Mazda MPV minivan. Final decision came down to the Santa Fe and Toyota Rav4.The Santa Fe won primarily on the greater ""bang for our buck"". The Santa Fe has more than adequate power. The ride is smooth and quiet. The interior is well thought out and comfortable. The exterior styling is attractive, but not ""over-done"". This vehicle is a pleasure to drive. I will have to see how reliability will be over time, but Hyundai's great warranty helps with piece of mind in that area.","V-6 engine, Interior comfort. Available cargo room. Smooth  & quiet ride. Attractive (blue) interior lighting. XM Radio (promotional offer) Outstanding warranty",Slightly bigger engine (more horsepower).IPOD input. Brighter choice of colors. Roof rack cross bars standard instead of option. Better MPG rating.
4.5,Really nice car,Dave ,02/06/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"I just traded in a 2001 BMW X5 so once I got over the BMW/Hynudai issue, I was fine.  It's a great car for the money.  I originally purchased the GLS but went back the next day and got the SE.  I like the little extras, especially the on wheel audio controls, compass in the rear view mirror, trip computer, and more.","XM radio is cool.  Love the amount of storage space, great gas mileage, even with the larger engine, takes regular unleaded gas, lots of places to hide stuff ","Better location for the trip computer buttons, windshield wiper controls are a bit confusing, the alarm for the seat belts is ANNOYING.  Overall, very few complaints.  "
4.125,Satisfied mostly,zannan ,02/04/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,4,5,3,4,"Have found this vehicle a fun car to drive and own. This is our second Hyundai, the first being an 2003 Elantra. It is a comfortable car that travels well and is overall an excellent vehicle. The gas mileage is a little low, (22mpg)but not a spoiler. So far the only issue we have is a loud high frequency buffeting noise that only is noticable when the rear side door window is rolled down. It occurs at 60 mph and stays with you until you reach alomost 95. I am taking it to the dealer to see what is causing this and if it can be fixed. I hope that it can because we live in Florida and although the a/c works fine, we didn't spend that much money to be cooped up all the time. ",Instrumentation layout is fine. Seats are comfortable. It has an adequate stereo system. Power to weight is proportionate and responsive at all speeds,
4.875,AMAZING.,L.Murphy ,01/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Fuel economy not the greatest. But compared to a truck, its great. The only thing I'm not totally impressed by is the 2nd and 3rd row air ducts for heating. they don't blow as hard or as hot of air as the front do. Other than that it truly is the smartest and best buy I've done in a long time. Great job to Hyundai, and building vehicles that extremely reliable.",,
4.875,'08 Santa Fe SE FWD joins the family,wamba2000 ,01/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just added the SF to our group of cars.  We have had an '06 Azera for 1.5 years and it has been a trouble-free and enjoyable car to drive.  When adding a vehicle due to a teen driver coming of age, I passed my '04 Element to the kid and was looking for the right blend of space, comfort, performance and value.  I drove the Rogue, Murano, Pilot, Sequoia, Sportage, Tucson and Veracruz.   The Santa Fe offered me the best combination for the qualities I wanted.  The SE is very well put together, quiet, roomy and my first tank of spirited suburban driving returned 20mpg...surprised for sure at that.  Hyundai has gotten the build and materials issues handled.  We'll watch durability over time.","Ride, Noise level, V-6 performance, handling, reclingin rear seats.  Even the stock sound system is pretty good","Wanted to purchase the Limited due to the way content is packaged, but for 2008, all Limiteds come with a sunroof.  I have height issues so the sunroof made it a knock-out"
4.625,Excellent ,Sold ,12/15/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,3,5,Ex-owner of a Pontiac Grand Prix I was somewhat apprehensive about getting a Santa Fe.  However after 2 months I have no regrets at all in having purchased the Santa Fe.  The interior is spacious and well made.  The exterior is an eye opener compared to the previous models.  The drive is smooth and very comparible to the Grand Prix which was superb.  The handling is very good.  No regrets what so ever would recommend it to anybody.,The heated leather seats are excellent especially in winter months.  Drives very good in snow and hugs the road making you feel secure.,Leave as it is presently.
