I have owned mine for almost a year and put 8500 miles on it and the only issue was the motor mount and a thermostat (but thermostats go out on 99% of all cars) the sunroof motor was also loose and quit functioning but 3 screws fixed that and its worked just fine since then. the car handles great and feels rock solid driving down the road. it does have a minor amount of wind noise but nothing that makes it unbearable, just noticeable (and may just be because its 7 years old)simply put this car is fun and handles great it seems to be built well and has not given me any major issues. just like all small mazda cars its zippy and fun. test drive one thats been well maintained (as thats what all cars need) and you will be pleasantly surprised at how it handles and the amount of power it has.Well I must say the car held up well, through a wreck in the rear that was not my fault a 11,000 pound f350 hit me and it was still drivable, got that fixed. then it got totaled by a wreck that was my fault, but it did its job and protected me. so I bought a 2011 to replace this one. they are great cars",,

3,Beware of this Car,George R. ,07/09/2015,2,3,4,,,2,3,3,4,,,"Mazda claims they are a different type of car company but as I am dealing with an issue they have revealed they are no different than GM or any other big car company. I lost my power steering a month ago while driving on the highway. When I returned home to find out if anyone else had experienced this problem I was surprised to see that my supposedly very reliable Mazda 3 had major problems with power steering issues. There was a recall back in 2010 for this problem. When I called Mazda customer support to report this issue I was told my car (I am the 2nd owner)  was recalled and repaired back in November of 2010. When I mentioned to them that this repair obviously failed again they said they were not responsible to do this repair a 2nd time as per government guidelines. When I asked them if they had replaced the power steering pump and assorted pieces with upgraded pieces that insured this would not happen again they said this was the case. I mentioned to them this was my second Mazda and I would hope they would do something for me since this was obviously something they were aware of.  They said they could do nothing for me. When I continued to argue my case with them, they suggested I bring my car to my local Mazda dealer to confirm the  issue (The dealer did so $120 later for diagnosis, $1,293.00 for the repair).  They mentioned to me they do have a ""Out of Warranty"" policy for some repairs but made no promises.  When they finally called back after 2 weeks, they reiterated they could do nothing for me despite confirmation that the repair done back in 2010 reoccurred with the new parts. I then asked them to reimburse me for the diagnosis since they requested I have it done. They again said no. Great customer service! Needless to say I will never purchase another Mazda.",,

The car performed fine for the first 75k miles or so, then began having serious problems involving the suspension.  The front axle and related parts (CV joints, boots, etc.) were replaced several times and the problem was finally fixed.  Fortunately, I had an extended warranty on the car, so only paid a deductible.  The car now has 119k miles on it and is running well.The car's paint is of average quality.  There are numerous pin sized rust spots on the side panels, especially towards the rear of the vehicle.  These appear to be surface rust that has formed where the paint has chipped, and there is no rust-through.Aside from these issues, the car has performed about as expected.

I decided late in 2009 that I needed to have another one but the second generation 3 was already at Mazda dealerships, sporting a vapid grin that I hated. I needed to find another first generation 3. The search for a SGT variant took me four years to find a low mileage pristine example CA car. When a 5-sp manual, White Pearl with navigation surfaced I pounced on it. It was well worth the effort and the wait. This car consistently delivers in smiles per mile.
With the third generation 3, Mazda recovered the sexy face in a more capable and complete package that will be on my short list in the future. 
","The razor sharp driving dynamics of this car are characteristic of it's athletic prowess. The car is flat out fun to drive. It feels a whole lot like the ""3"" from Bavaria for less than half the price. This car is just a solid value and a joy to drive. I call my Mazda 3 ""the mailman"" because it always delivers.
The small manufacturer from Hiroshima really knocked this one out of the park. Bravo!
Handsome, chiseled styling and the richest interior in the compact segment are the frosting on the cake.","There are a couple of shortfalls in what is overall a pretty seamless execution.  The rear seat could benefit from a couple of inches of additional leg room.  The carpeting and sunvisors are dreadfully cheap, and a remote trunk release and heated mirrors should have been part of the SGT package. This is where a samll manufacturer like Mazda is really at a disadvantage where they lack the business scale to justify developing a full featured complement of trim levels. "

My ratings are based on expectations of the class, and not comparisons to my previous luxury car.   I'm quite pleased with the handling of this compact.  Though somewhat under-tired, it can stand up to a road like decker canyon blvd (23).  The clutch is light in feel, but gives you a good sense of it's action through your foot, gearbox is excellent.  Had the opportunity to test the brakes in a panic stop in my first week of driving, and they're probably in the top 10 of any car under $100k.","Aside from the fun of good grip, a manual transmission, and a free-reving engine, I really enjoy the heated seats: it's like having a back massager.  I'm a big fan of the xenon headlights for safety, as well as the stability control.  Interior is tasteful, and ergonomically efficient.","Turn signal sound is difficult to hear with the stereo on, minor, I know.

Power when you need it, MPG's are adequate enough, Stops on a dime, Frontal chassis & great suspension provide a great ride. Interior features only lack cruise control, gps and a driver's seat with height position ajustment but the telescopic steering wheel make up for it.  The center arm rest and compartment console position you perfectly and even when the seat quality is less then the top model it extends on it's side to hold you in place. The sound system rocks, I especially like the dash design and everything to go with it, fit and finish is perfect. Passenger space is adequate for a car its size and I vehemently disagree with others the truck is big.","European slick styling sporty look, front and rear light design. This car is beautiful and performs marvelously. Mazda truly put their hearts and soul in effort into this masterpiece car at an incredibly affordable price.  Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla or Scion TC come close to this car.  ","Passenger door metal sheet needs to be thicker it's too thin, it's why the car's side crash test had problems. "

Until winter of 08 and it snowed. This is by far the worst front wheel drive car I have ever owned or driven in any type of slippery condition. The anti lock brakes are always on and off at every stop and go situation as wheels spin out of control. I love this car in good dry weather, but this is not a car for upstate NY. I spent $900 for snow tires, didn't make any change in performance or handling. This car will not make it to next winter of 09.",Heated leather seats. Cool auto lights on/off and wipers.

5,Love this car!,EAG ,01/28/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I spent forever researching cars to buy and I test drove a few (the VW Rabbit, the Civic and the Toyota Matrix) before I was definite on the 3. The test drives clinched it. My mechanic of 15 years was also enthusiastic about the Mazda and now I know why. I am in love with my car. It is so sporty  (looks and performance) and I couldn't be happier.  I have the 5 speed and the shifting is so smooth, I would swear it was a pricier model/brand. I love to drive but I was looking for fuel economy too and I definitely picked a winner. The acceleration is excellent, but so is the fuel economy. 25-27 in the city, in heavy traffic, and 32-35 on the highway. Nice! You won't be disappointed at all. I'm thinking of buying another for my husband. ",The best aspect is the style. I see my car and I almost can't believe how inexpensive it was. It appears and handles like a much more expensive car. The handling is sharp and the stereo w/the iPod adapter is also awesome. I recently drove an Accord and it confirmed that my car was the best choice!,"A little loud in urban setting (we're talking South Bronx here). Potholes are a bit rough, but other than that, no complaints here! You won't be disappointed at all. I'm thinking of buying another for my husband. "
4.125,Fun drive but....,CT driver ,01/22/2009,,,4,5,5,4,,4,3,3,5,"I got this car after my Toyota was involved in an accident. This car is fun to drive and solid. Has decent acceleration and excellent braking steering, cornering. I like the flexibility of the hatchback and it's look. The gas mileage is a disappointment only 25 mpg with combined driving (no lead foot). After my Toyota I note too much road noise and feel every seam in the road. Pricing and multiplicity of trim levels is somewhat dubious/confusing.","Steering braking, cornering,hatchback & style. Consumer reports says it has been reliable.","Need to tweak engine to get better mpg (hopefully will be done on new 2010). Regular headlights too dim, road noise too pronounced, seats not comfortable on long drives. Re-do center dash display and D/C the orange light.

All with oxygen sensor problems which the service manager told me doesn't happen often. Well it's happened 3 times with me and it sucks. Worried about how reliable this car will be down the road. I had planned on keeping this car for a long time now I'm already looking for a replacement.,Love the 6 disc changer and connection for my iPod. Like the hatchback and ability to put the seats down and fit all my gear. Golf clubs & skis,I don't know maybe figure out how to build and fix oxygen sensors?

My only inconvenience with this model is that the headrests block the rear view mirror's view and the side window design makes it challenging to see cars in either lane when changing lanes.  Took a little bit of adjustment to turn my head more to the sides before changing lanes to catch the blind spot.  Can't say enough good about his car.  I've had Honda Civics and Toyota Corollas and the Protege before, and this car is by far the best for handing, acceleration, and just pure fun. The other did however have better fuel economy.",Nimble handling and power to accelerate when you need it.,Smaller head rests.

This is an awesome car. The ride is smooth, and it's really fun to drive! It gets average fuel economy for its class, but the power from the 2.0 liter 4 cylinder engine is much better than you would expect! This car can definitely take off, and the manumatic shifting on the 4 speed automatic transmission is a nice touch. Kudos to the people responsible for this design! It just goes to show you that you don't have to sacrifice style for your money! This car is beautiful! From the halogen headlights, to the black-out tail lights, and the optional 17-inch alloys - this is a sporty car!","Sporty styling, nice interior, long list of options, gas mileage, performance, and value.","Interior plastic could be upgraded a little bit, but it's really hard to think of any other improvements that Mazda could have made.

Very sporty car with lots of interior space.  Surprisingly agile handling and a high fun to drive factor.  It's not an Audi interior (what else is?), but it's miles above the competition at this price point (and higher).  No repair issues at all.",MP3 compatibility (great location).  Dashboard lighting.

The dealership checked every box, including navigation, sunroof, and the Bose multi-changer cd.  The fit and finish in this car is hard to beat in the class and price range.  Everything about this car is high quality.  So far, in my first 500 miles, I haven't found anything to dislike.  I was worried about ""trading down"" from a sports car, but I think I've really come out on the winning end with performance, economy, and an upscale interior with all of the amenities one could want.","So many! Okay, the heated leather seats are a blessing right now in the cold Missouri mornings. The rain- sensing wipers make me smile. The five- speed manual is velvety smooth and supremely easy to use.  Great headlights! And the looks, inside and out, I am really impressed all the way around","The radio controls are a little bit fussy.  The Bose stereo, with plenty of bass thump, needs more tweeters.  Voice recognition on the navi would be nice.  I'm getting about 27-30mpg, but better fuel economy would be nice.

Proper layout in the interior; Shifter placement is superb, and the tunnel nestles next to your right leg in perfect position as a rest spot on long journeys.  Pedals light and user friendly. Exterior design is that of 'form equivalent function', meaning there is enough emotion but all of it is usable.  Of course the chassis is up to snuff, ready to drive your any and every mood.","It's a 'put it in your back pocket' kind of car that grows not on you but with you.  Super sound and reliable, I'm looking forward to actually keeping this car for quite a while.

4.5,Easy choice,Mike ,12/21/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,4,5,The Mazda3 is hands down the best car to buy out of all the compacts if you're looking for value and maybe a little respect on the road.  I test drove every car in this class trying to find a car that wouldn't bust my bank and was still fun to drive.  Nothing compared to the Mazda 3 when it comes to the fun to drive factor and the amount of options for the price. If you like driving a manual transmission make sure you test drive this car.  Nothing else compares when it comes to 5 speed manuals at this price.  I've been nothing but impressed with my Mazda 3 so far. Mazda has done a great job of reinventing themselves.  ,Performance and styling. European styling inside and out make the car look like a lot more than a budget compact.  The suspension is amazing and the engine is geared just right.  There is virtually no lag when shifting unlike its competitors (Much better than the VW Jetta I test drove).,More trunk space would be nice.
4.5,6 months later!,Melissa  ,12/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,I wrote a review about a month after I bought the car. I was overall happy with the car and still am. I just notice lots of engine noise. I inquired about Sirius radio and it's $715 to install and for parts that is insane. If they put the SAT button on my dash it should have already come installed and only needed activation. The paint chips ever so easily thankfully the touch up paint was only 8 bucks. I think it may be the alloys but when you hit a bump or pot whole the tire feels likes it about to fall off. I drove one with reg hubcaps and didnt feel that! I love everything else about the car and still dont regret trading my Cavalier...although sometimes I do miss her!,The ipod hook up.

I would have preferred a stick but had to compromise with the Mrs and opt for the auto - I've been very pleased with it though and have zero regrets with this choice of transmission.

It's fun to drive, quick, handles like it's on rails & never below 30 MPH. Mine is Copper Red, the interior is Beige & Black, very sharp. I have seen only a couple like mine in Indy.

They contacted the Mazda rep, and he came to the dealer in Ottawa IL., but they didn't even show him my car, and I was told Mazda would pay one third of the cost to replace the tires, if they were replaced at the dealer.

4.75,Very glad I bought this car!,JoanC ,09/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This is one snappy little car and I'm very pleased with it. I've had it about a week and traded a loaded 2002 Jetta turbo for it (hooray, no more premium gas!). The cars that got great mileage (e.g. the Honda Fit) didn't have the power I need for a local highway where certain onramps force you to merge from a standing stop, so the Mazda was a compromise between mileage and power. It handles and drives beautifully, is well-equipped and well-designed with excellent fit and finish.  Cons: there's more road noise than I'm used to and the sporty ride is stiff/bouncy.  Also, the automatic transmission shift gates take some getting used to. These are just nits--I highly recommend this car.","Dash layout and lighting, steering wheel audio controls, handling, power, looks. Cupholders everywhere. Covered rear hatch has plenty of room.  60/40 folding back seats that an adult can actually sit in.","Need to do something about road noise, stiff suspension.

I am surprised it doesn't get better gas mileage though considering it's size. The fit and finish of the interior is surprisingly nice for the price. The exterior style is far more trendy than others in its class like the Sentra, Corolla, or Civic. ",The lights on the dash are really a nice touch. The standard wheels are nicer than some standard wheels on higher end cars. ,"A trunk release on the key fob would be handy. I didn't realize it didn't have it before I purchased. It's not even an option. The auto-down on the driver's window is nice, but adding the auto-up feature would be nice too.

I added a spoiler and tinted the windows, and I have a nice little sports car for less than 19k.  It's attractive, fun, roomy, and very practical.  I only wish the gas mileage would be a little higher, but I guess Mazda didn't want to compromise the horsepower.  I'm surprised they didn't add a remote trunk opener to the keyless entry, a minor annoyance, but the other positives like 17"" alloys, steering wheel radio controls, outside temp, moonroof, and fog lamps more than make up for anything it's lacking.

I'm a big guy 6'3"" and after checking out all of the competition (focus, matrix, versa, astra, etc) I found the Mazda 3 by far the most comfortable.  It looks great, good price, and has been averaging 29 mpg at 75% commute, 25% interstate.  While the instruments, controls and displays are well laid out, the back lit orange display leaves something to be desired.  The radio display is hard to read in many lighting situations, and is almost impossible to see with sunglasses on. It would have been really nice to see an MPG readout.  ",Driver comfort for a large guy is great. I can ride 5 hrs straight with no problem. With the seat folded down its got almost as much room in the back as my old Escape.  I'm getting great mileage on my daily commute averaging 28-29 mpg.  ,"Right in the middle of the center dial is a giant digit showing the gear the automatic trans is in.

I really want to buy an electric car, so this car is to get me through the next few years.  Other than being 20th century technology, it seems like a solid, nice car.  I would have preferred to buy a hatchback but did not want to bump up to the wagon with its heavier weight and bigger engine.  I've had a difficult time getting accustomed to the clutch -- it seems to engage much higher on the pedal than I'm used to.  I've also noticed the air conditioner seems to place a lot of drag on the engine; this can make judging the gas/clutch mixture a little tricky sometimes.  Overall, I'd recommend it for the price.","Seats - the comfortable seats sealed the deal (wow, those Rabbit seats were horrible); exterior styling; solid feel -- good zoom-zoom-to-price ratio; OK mileage; huge ""glove"" box; full complement of air bags/curtains","Trunk release on fob!!!; gauges are not readable in the daytime if the lights are on; better mileage; make a hatchback option (other than the wagon); better speakers/stereo; automatic lights; tire pressure readout; instant and average fuel consumption readout; at least a ""mild"" hybrid option"

Handles very well even if you do feel the body roll a bit more than say a mini but a lot less than the civic.  Acceleration isn't great off the line but acceleration in the 40-70 MPH driving band is very adequate for passing.  In short the gearing to HP gives you the acceleration where your likely to need it more often than not.  Mileage varies based on how sporty I'm driving it.

As far as the suspension and brakes are conserned they exceed my expectations by far.  For a fwd you can't beat the handling.  Overall this car is definitely worth the money.","Handling, MPG I am getting between 27-31 mpg and only 3300 miles on the odo! So it will only get better!

I find the mpg is a bit lower than I had hoped for, but it might be that I just can't go slow in this car! So far my best mpg is about 28 when I keep it on cruise control 70mph.

It drives like a sports car, the engine sound is clean during acceleration and almost silent when cruising. It has a massive trunk for a small car. The car looks bigger than it is, and I am 6'2'' and I find the front spacious and the back tolerable but tight. Interior lights are red and dash has cool blue shine.

If you are looking for a car with style, interior and exterior beauty, performance and even good gas mileage for under 20,000 dollars look no further, this is the car you are going to get. Mazda compares this car to the honda civic and toyota corolla. First of all, bad comparison, the mazda3 surpasses both these cars by far. The mazda3 offers more bang for the buck in every single possible way. You get far more features then both other cars can offer, and these features are included standard, not for extra money.  22/29 is what they say, I've been getting 24.5 miles per gallon,50/50 streets/highway.

Bought the ""3"" to be used by my college-age daughters while Mazda was offering the 0% APR deal (and to avoid the  stupid No. VA transportation tax).  As with all my Mazda vehicles, the driving position, design, and sporting nature have been retained even in the base model i Sport I purchased.  I liked the fact that finding one with ABS and side curtain airbags was not impossible in the base model.  My only complaint would be the colors on the instruments.  There's just not enough contrast for my 50+ year old eyes.","Styling, handling, smooth engine, crisp 5-speed shifting and very smooth clutch (good for newbies).

Glove box is huge and trunk is good size for car. I am getting around 25-28 miles to the gallon, that's with mixed freeway city driving.

I purposely chose the ""S"" model as side air impact bags were standard.  Unfortunately we had the opportunity to test the SRS system in a recent accident which leads me to this review so others are not taken in by the false safety ratings that Mazda publishes.  The car suffered significant damage on both passenger side doors and in my case the air bags did not deploy.  I suffered serious injuries that could have been prevented if they had.

I have no complaints at all and recommend this vehicle entirely.

However, I will say I am not pleased with the silly horn, it sounds like it belongs on a small scooter, maybe a motorized bicycle.  The bird chirping horn does not match the quality of the car.  And I can't say I am all that pleased with the heater, it takes 15 minutes or better to attain comfort, at which time I am usually at my destination, freezing from the cold.  Also, the panic button on the switch fob has a range of about 20 feet.  My previous car panic button had a much greater range, helping me find where I parked the car on occasion.

Consider if you can tolerate these: 1. factory speakers are horrible.  Replaced all 4 with cheapo $26 speakers, for a major improvement.  2. Even understanding that performance uses gas, mileage is less than expected (26- 29 mpg).  3. Stock tires flat spot after sitting and need to warm up before the tiny thumping goes away. Otherwise stock tire performance and noise is fine so far.  No need to slow down and brake for corners.  That makes it very fun to drive!","Mp3 input gets used a lot. Dash layout and steering wheel controls all work well.  Styling is dead on.  Hatch space is big enough for a family of 4 to all go to the grocery.  I like the sporty handling.

I needed to get a new car and heavily researched the Mazda3 in addition to the Honda Civic Si, Honda Accord Coupe, Mitsubishi Lancer, Subaru Impreza WRX and BMW 328. As you can tell, price was not so much of a issue for me as getting a car I really liked.  I was worried that the Mazda3 was underpowered and too ""economy"" (i.e. cheap and mundane) for my tastes, but after driving all of the cars mentioned above I was left with little doubts. Without exaggeration, this car drives and handles like a BMW. I could not be happier with the purchase.","The interior build quality far surpasses all my other choices with the exception of the Accord and BMW. I can't believe I'm driving a sub $20K car.  Also, I would highly recommend the manual transmission.

The Zoom-Zoom of this 3 really differentiates it from all others.  The 2.3L loves to be revved and the manual transmission definitely helps squeeze every ounce of power from the four-banger.  I was debating whether or not to get the navigation system but decided against it as is not worth the $1500 price tag because it does not even have the touchscreen like the CX-7. At the end of the day, this car is near perfect for the price at around $20K!","The GT trim (seats and door) for a more luxurious feel, Bose sound system, Xenon headlights that definitely light up the whole road, the utility and versatility of the cargo area, heated front seats, and the confidence that it has the same chassis as the Volvo with safety written all over it.","Leather a bit hard, road noise prominent at highways speeds, no rear hatch release on the key fob, gas and brake pedal too close together, plastics get scuff marks really easily, MPG was a little disappointing (Averaged 28MPG) but I guess that what you get for the Zoom-Zoom!"

I have nearly 700 miles on it in 2 weeks and each day it continues to amaze me I'm not driving a German car.","Xenon lights (nice and bright), auto wipers, auto climate control. Handling is fantastic.","Power driver seat, extend leather to headrests instead of pleather, visor extensions when using on sides, automatic leveling for xenon lights."
4.875,"Don't hesitate, just get one!",gishapir ,09/06/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I couldn't be happier with the car so far and I've only done a few hundred miles.  The AC works beautifully (I know some people have complained with the '07 model). The back seat area, although small, fits 3 people in the back rather comfortably.  When only 2 are in the back, there is a rather wide seat separator with two cup holders.  Even the doors have cup holders on the sides!  The car is a 4 cyl. car so don't expect crazy acceleration, but it does an amazing job of taking off and accelerating via the manual control from 3 to 4th gears. The car takes turns amazingly. The car is virtually silent while idling.  There is also amazing room in the glove comp. I'm very pleased so far!","Dashboard lights. 6-CD dash loading. Moonroof protector gives a virtually silent ride. The leather seats are comfortable and very adjustable. Every passenger has a handle to hold on to, except the driver of course. Leather steering wheel feels really good.  Cargo tray is a must in the back.","Road noise (largely due to factory tires). Built-in blind spot mirror. Cheap sun visors. A lock for the gear shift because when it's in drive, it's too easy to throw it into manual mode by mistake. "
4.875,More bang for your buck!,Bps1977 ,09/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is my second Mazda 3, I previously owned an 04 4 door and while the car remains mostly unchanged, it's excitement keeps rising.  The included dynamic stability and traction control with this model will be sure to help in the ice and snow, while the moon roof will comfort during the warmer months. The car is absolutely a work of art and I could not think of a better car to get, even for my second go around with it.","Integrated audio in the steering wheel, MP3 jack with extra power outlet, dash lighting, handling!  ",Still need remote trunk/hatch release. Slightly better stock speakers.
4.5,My Mazda 3 S Touring,William Schwarz ,08/18/2007,,,5,5,4,4,,5,4,4,5,"I have only about 300 miles on the Mazda.  It is fun to drive and handles very well.  The steering and suspension is crisp, the brakes are responsive and smooth. My first tank of gas, mostly local suburban driving, was over 28 MPG.  The engine runs slightly rough idling while stopped.  I was told this is characteristic of a four cylinder engine.  It is surprisingly quick off the line. The only other comment I have is that the key fob does not have a button to open the trunk. All doors may be locked and unlocked from the key fob but for some reason they did not include a trunk release which seems like an oversight.  The body panels have good fit, finish and integrity. So far I am very pleased.","I like the moon roof and 6 CD in dash sound system, also the instrumentation and lighting therein. The telescoping tilt wheel is a nice adjustment for varied driving positions.  ",The ability to open the trunk from the key fob.  I would like to see illuminated automatic door lock buttons and power window switches as well.
4.875,Zoom zoom,rob ,08/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just got home from the dealership, I really love this car. It's got a sweet interior. I test drove an 07 Civic LX sedan and this had more power, not much by horsepower, but I think the Mazda3 is also lighter, so it has a higher power to weight ratio. Really like the 16"" rims and 4 wheel disk brakes. Real fun to drive.","I love the instrument panel, the red is very nice.  All the features are easy to use. Its acceleration and handling are great.  Love the exterior design.  I love this car.","the keyring should have a trunk release and maybe just a little better mpg, but it's still not bad."
5,Wow!,Jay ,08/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is truly the best available vehicle retailing under 20k. It has all of the benefits of a Civic with supperior styling. The interrior is even on the lower trim models is nicer than many more expensive vehicles. If you test drive an compare it to a Civic, Jetta, or Sentra you will be blown away. The car is flat out awesome.",Interior design. Sound system. Moon roof.,
