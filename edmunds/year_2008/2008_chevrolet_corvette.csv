5,Z06 compresses time and space.,Sonderklasse ,10/14/2016,5,,3,,,,,5,3,,,"With 500 or so horsepower in a 3200-lb. car, things happen a lot faster than you expect, and you get from point A to point B a lot faster than you expected.  And this isn't the first fast car I've owned.  But I'd love the Z06 if it had half the power--the Corvette team ""added lightness"" (aluminum, titanium, magnesium and carbon fiber) and the car feels alive.  Yet the Z06 isn't particularly punishing, except for the gas bill.  The handling is sharp, up to a point.  I've never tracked it, and the car's limits are so high that it's difficult or impossible to explore them on the street, but my sense, based on some ""spirited"" driving in the hills, is that you take a Z06 past 8/10s at your peril.  It's extremely easy to get the car out of shape with a little too much throttle, even at low speeds.  Whether there's too much power for the chassis, or the chassis doesn't give enough feedback for the car to inspire confidence at or near the limit, I don't know.  Probably both.  The unpredictability is part of the thrill, of course, but I'd think twice before turning off the traction control.  Anyway, it's the first car in 46 years of driving that hasn't ended up boring me.  Tremendous bang for the buck, as long as you can keep it pointed straight.",,
5,Sexy and fun,Dale Bogle ,04/26/2016,5,3,4,,,5,4,5,4,,,"Make sure you get the paddle shift and NPP exhaust options.  More fun shifting with paddles and NPP exhaust gives you the loud rumble a Corvette should have.  The 2008 mods to the C6 line are welcome, handling much improved, but I would get the Z51option next time.",,
5,Always an eye-catcher,Dominick Lacovara ,01/26/2016,5,4,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"My wife and I have absolutely loved this car from the day we purchased it. The comfort, performance and reliability can't be beat, especially for the price. You could pay twice as much and still not get a car of this quality. We drove it on a 9,000 mile road trip around the United States in the fall of 2008 and averaged 27 mpg. The navigation was a huge aid. Don't believe the car magazine criticisms of the seats, but ask any C6 owner or try them yourself to realize how comfortable and supportive they are. The 430 horsepower is all you could desire and more. The Corsa Sport exhaust I installed added 12 additional horses and 13 lbs of torque and an aggressive throaty sound on acceleration and quiet cruising. While I aspire to eventually purchase a C7, I will have difficulty parting with this C6, the lines of which I actually prefer.",,
5,Well Pleased,Rob Joyner ,01/20/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,5,5,,,"I purchased my 2008 Base model, 3LT, Z51, NPP 3 years ago with 29,000mi. on the clock. I have been very pleased with it. I have done only oil changes; everything has been completely reliable. The car is easy to learn, very driver friendly. My partner (girlfriend) enjoys it very much (definitely a plus). I have put 14,000mi. on it since getting it and have absolutely no complaints. Some have commented that the interior is a little drab but I am very satisfied with it. The engine is ""leggy"" with good torque and hp throughout a broad rpm range, I don't have to be constantly changing gears although I like the engine sound with the NPP defeated so I find myself shifting almost unnecessarily just hear the exhaust note. I have the NPP bypass remote (came with the car) and that enhances the driving a great deal as I can hear the exhaust when I want and I can return it to normal mode when I want less sound so I can listen to music (I really like this feature). The roof panel is fairly easy to remove/replace with no particular awkwardness although care must be used when doing so, and it stows in the trunk area in the retaining brackets, only it does take up a lot of the available trunk area, but if I'm traveling with luggage I'm not going to be doing it with the roof panel off as I would likely get tired of that after couple hours. I scored the performance high but I'm sure I haven't tested the limits of the car (I'm a senior citizen, and I think it's a good idea for me to not push the car beyond my limits with the possible consequences of breakage, collision and higher insurance premiums; the car does everything I want it to. The leather on the seats is good quality and the fit/finish of the car overall is very good. I drive it year round here in the mountains of western NC, USA, and I have a set of summer tires on aftermarket wheels and change over to the all-season tires on the factory wheels when winter comes. This is an extra expense but I really don't like the idea of the car sitting in the garage thru the winter and my not being able to enjoy it, but to each his own. I chose to go this route with the tires since these cars come with summer tires and it's not recommended they be used below 50 degrees F, and since the all-season tires are twice the price of summer tires I think I'm saving money in the long run, and again, I get to enjoy the car year-round. A lot of people (who are true car people) do look at the car with interest/admiration and I have to admit that's a pretty cool feeling, although that's not the reason I bought it. I bought it to drive and enjoy the technology/performance/style, and it's a car I could afford where I could get that. Overall, the fuel economy is good, surprising that 430hp could still result in such figures (average 23mpg). If I had $110k to spend, I'd probably get a 2016 ZO6. I toured the Bowling Green Assy. plant a couple years ago and was impressed with the dedication that goes into these cars.",,

After 1 week the glove box latch fell apart.  In less than a year the rear end started clunking around corners, replaced the fluid. At year 1 the clutch pedal started squeaking every time it was released, replaced the position sensor.  At year 1.5 a cam position sensor failed.  After 2 years the water pump failed.

No other manufacturer can give you the performance, reliability, comfort, fuel economy, design and value that Chevrolet provides.  I've owned my 'Vette for ~ 1 yr and can't be happier with the experiences thus far.  The car has unbelievable amounts of HP and torque.  The ride is quite comfortable too; on par with most sports sedans / coupes.  The interior is a little sub par when taking into consideration the MSRP when new, but I'd recommend not purchasing new if you want to save some considerable money.  The seats are a little flimsy, but for daily driving or simply cruising, the seats are more than adequate.

Children all grown now with their own children, so I love my machine silver 2008 LT3 convertible with titanium interior and gray top.  My wife never liked Vettes, but now she's a fan too!  Nearing 16,000 miles and only one small issue - the cheap plastic glove box latch broke and was replaced under warranty.   NPP option is nice.

Awesome acceleration! Service - Chevy dealers everywhere","More supportive seats. Handling on a par with it's European competition - you can do this, Chevy!

Car was purchased new but I took it to a body shop to see if it was ever hit and repainted. Seams don't line up, door doesn't close flush. Worst stereo I have ever heard. Cheap interior. Center console was put on incorrectly. Window indexing mechanism was defective. Brakes continued to squeak even after service addressed issue. Loud and embarrassing buzzing/humming sound coming from the dash when car goes over 70mph. Too many other problems to list.",The exterior of this car is a work of art (from a distance). Great gas mileage. OnStar is a nice feature.,How this car made it through the quality control part of production line is beyond me. Hire people that actually care about the quality of their work.
5,No car better!,Conrad ,12/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I'm a mechanical engineer and I love this car, my first Corvette! Acceleration, fuel economy, fun to drive. It's much more than I thought a Corvette could be. The engineers who worked on this car should be very proud. I test drove what I thought was my dream car, a BMW Z coupe, M series (my daily driver is a 5 series) and it did not compare. Only two options; Z51 and dual mode exhaust. I removed the fuse from the exhaust so it's open all the time. At 58 years old, this car makes me feel the same way I did when I was 23. I drive it on day long trips through the Ozark mountains, simply wonderful. A pure expression of freedom and individuality. It's magic!","Acceleration, it's breathtaking.

5,What a beast!,Cokernut ,12/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I finally pulled the trigger when Chevy had the employee pricing. I couldn't be happier with the car. The acceleration is breathtaking. The lines of the car are sharp and a real eye catcher. My only complaint on this beast is the stereo sound system. For $70K put a good sound system in. I purchased the atomic orange Z06 and it accelerates like an atomic bomb and the roar of the exhaust is better than the stereo anyways. I have owned a 1990 Vette and the technology now is just unbelievable especially the Z06. Am I happy with the car, heck yes.",The engine and the beautiful color. Heads up display is so cool.

I test drove TT,335I, IS350, G35. The power of this car with NPP,Z51 and 6 speed manual is a rush. Nothing compares in this price range. I do think the seats could be more comfortable and I will replace the run flats with Pilot Sports when worn out. The targa top ""pops"" over large bumps. I've been told that is a common issue but easy to fix.  When driving aggressively I sometimes have troulbe finding 3rd gear. Bought the Mild to Wild dual mode exhaust controller and run it open all the time. The sound is awesome. Overall very happy with it and can't wait to get back in it.","6 speed, NPP exhaust and Z51. New rims for 08. Push button start.  Being able to select competitive mode or turn off traction control. It does make a difference in acceleration. Be careful though!",Lose the run flats.

I thought seriously about buying a Nissan GTR, but after seeing the GTR  in person, I felt it remined me of a fancy Nissan Altima with new fenders. The engine sounded tame and boring. It just didnt excite me much. In contrast, just standing near the Z06 Corvete and looking at it, makes your heart race. I fell in love with this sexy beast from the moment it rumbled to life with a push of the button. The car looks twice in good in person as it does in pictures and sounds beautiful. It's incredibly fun to drive, and I have to beat the girls away from it. I absolutly love it.","Beautiful color, full leather interior. Comfort of the seats, the HUD display.

With GM reporting a sales decrease of 45% for October, I knew now was the time to pull the trigger. I bought the machine silver 2008 convertible with titanium interior and a black top. It looks great in the garage and I smile everytime I open the garage door. Absolutely no buyer's remorse. The only reason I gave the interior design a 9 is because I can't plug my MP3 into the stereo... what's that all about?

2.375,An Elephant in the Alps,Bill ,09/03/2008,,,1,1,1,3,,5,3,4,1,"I got this car in place of a Porsche 911 S and believe me, this car is no Porsche. It's huge for a ""sports car"". A sports car is supposed to be small, powerful and nimble. The Vette's handling is comparable to an elephant trying to perform on the balance beam at the Olympics. Sure, I like the power under the hood.  30 horses with the dual mode exhaust sounds great, but that's about the only thing that's great on this car. After driving BMW's, Z cars, Porsche's and even my Mercedes E350, I am very disappointed in the way this car's handing and appointments are for the money. Can't anyone in the U.S. build a ""sports car"" at least in the league of the afore mentioned. Pitiful.    ",The power.,Downsize the car (baby elephant walk comes to mind). Build the car so tires that are 2 miles wide don't have to make up for the car's poor handling. The Bose sound system is a joke. The interior quality is a joke along with the cheap convertible top.

Thank you Chevrolet!","The 505hp LS7 is a modern marvel of  old fashion, but highly modernized push rod V8 engine techology, with 3"" exhausts, is music to my ears.

This car looks incredible and has the performance to match the looks. Complete strangers tell me they love it, and even my wife saw it and said it was the best looking Vette she had ever seen. I bought it 48 hours later. It graces my garage parked next to my 02 vette (7,200 miles) which I am saving for my only daughter who was born in 2002. The license plates have her name and 02. At 5 years old she is already a Vette fanatic, she has good taste like her dad and mom.","The sound of that motor is music to my ears, so much so that I do not even listen to the radio at all. It screams power from start to shut down,and oh what a feeling.

In 2004 I bought a beautiful black 2002 convertible and I really loved it, then I began reading about the 2008 and the new engine, and I figured since I had just turned 60 I would by a new Corvette. I ordered a Crystal red convertible, ebony interior, dual mode exhaust and LT3 package. I have not been disappointed, it handles like a dream, it feels so tight and manageable and when you just step on the gas, not floor it, you are doing 70 before you know it, but the best part is that almost every time I take it out, strangers will stop and tell me that is the ""best looking car I've ever seen"".

So spending 45K on this car was a huge gamble for me. If Toyota or Honda made a real supercar then there would be no Vette in my garage. But I have to say, without a doubt this is one of the best cars in America today.  Built with quality and not one problem so far. Very happy with the performance, 26+MPG on the highway and the fit and finish that will match anything from Japan. The 08 is much more than the 07 model.  Hold out for a 08, you will be glad you did. Excellent ride and performance for the money. Much nicer dash layout than any other year Vette. I'm just so happy the fit and finish is as nice as it is. Also, Chevy is finally after all these years making the dash layout worth looking at. Seeing the same dash components in the Vette as the Chevette is one reason I waited so long to get one. Much better dash/interior than the previous years. Go and get one.",6 speed manual is fun. Dual mode exhaust is a must have. Z51 is a must have.

Ggreat handling, great brakes, fat tires, low to the ground, super wide, etc. The looks of this car is just unbelievable. The regular Vette looks so plain and simple compared to the fat fender z06. This car is a real challenge for Ferrari, Porsches, Lamborghinis, you name it. This car screams on the highway, the sound of the engine is spectacular. It makes you want to go to the garage and just start up the car so that you can hear the engine.

The 6 speed auto works well for high traffic cities while the paddles allow for manual pleasures when desired.

The automatic shift from 1st to 4th light does not comes on and off whether I am actually shifting from 1st to 4th. Sometimes the vehicle will not let me fill a full tank instead it only allows me to fill 1/2 a tank. My traction light comes on and off whenever it wants and it seems the rear end is slipping. When I make wide slow turns the steering wheel gets rock hard and I have to really hold it tight as if I didnt have power steering. When I pull my vehicle up to my drive way I hear the roof of the car crackling as if the roof is shifting. My power seat control went out the first week of owership and they had to replace it.,I really do like the performance of the engine and how much power it has. I fell in love with the car when I saw the exterior of the vehicle.,I think for a car this expensive the interior of the vehicle could need some vamping. I thought the seats were all made of leather but I found out part was leather and other vinyl. I thought the carbon fiber dash parts were real but rather it was imitation.

We both decided we weren't ready for the a Caddy, so we got a new Vette. The only comment I can make that says it all is that it is everything I dreamed it would be and more. We got the Z51 package, which is a little bit stiffer suspension. I was worried it might be a little rough riding, but it isn't.  It's smooth as glass. I reccomend the Z51. The one option I didn't get and wish I had is the dual mode exhaust.  Even without it, it still has a pretty good sound to it.  If you take it easy on the highway, you can get pretty close to 30mpg, which is amazing for 430 HP.  It's a rocket on wheels.",The seats wrap around you for a really good feel.

In highway driving I can easily get 26 or 27 MPG, this is incredible for a 500 HP car. The seats are very comfortable as is the driving position. The car is hard to get in and out because it is very low to the ground. The suspension is very stiff which does not bother me but could be to much for some owners.

Obviously, it is a sportscar and no one can deny it's performance (even not considering it's price).  I shopped several european vehicles and looked at a couple of Asian models. The only thing close of US manufacturer's are the Viper (not civil enough for me) and the Cadillac, which is a heavier underpowered Corvette. Nothing compared.

Dual mode exhaust sounds simply awesome when you punch it in the guts, and adds a bit more power to boot.  And who knew that a car capable of nearly 190 mph could get 25-30 mpg when driven normally.

I got another all Black version with the LT3 package, 6sp manual, Navigation system, Z-51 handling package with dual exhaust system. I must be a masochist for getting black a third time but when clean nothing looks better. By far this is the best Corvette I have ever owned. The vehicle now really has the horse power to be called a Corvette. The handing is crisp and precise and the acceleration is enough to cause whiplash. I have installed some additions; mesh grill, wild to mild exhaust controller, CAGS eliminator, iPod interface with HD radio and better rear speakers (Focals). Other than that I can see nothing else to change.","Acceleration, improved interior, clean exterior and the slightly smaller dimensions that the C5.

I am ussually a M-6 guy but this A-6 is plenty quick. The paddle shifters are way too slow and if you pull down instead of up you will overrev the engine quick.

The looks and performance of the C6 got my attention and the 08 improvements really got me thinking.  I finally took the plunge and bought an 08 JSB/Cashmere car w/ 6sp and 2LT. You can't help but smile when you nail the throttle, hear that big V8 scream, and feel the tires fighting for traction. I came from Porsches mostly but I have owned something from about every sports car manufacturer. My most recent was an 02 911 Cabrio.  I have to say that this is my favorite of anything I've owned. GM has done a magnificent job and no excuses are necessary. Drive one and you'll understand!","LS3 Power (feels like a much bigger bump from the LS2 than GM claims). Styling, good stereo, sound, good ride, did I mention power?",I find the center console cover hard on the elbow but they make a leather replacement for about $150 that should fix that.  Shifter action could be more crisp. High hoodline makes it difficult to place the front of the car but I understand the front engine V8 nature. Nothing big really.

A portable nav is easier to operate and less expensive, save the money and get the nicer wheels. The (npp) bi-modal exhaust is very cool and with the wild to mild aftermarket kit, you can select it whenever you want to. Paddleshift aut is nice, but again I'd probably save the money next time and get the 6 spd manual.

The American auto industry is raising the bar with this car. I was shopping between all the new cars and I am very happy with my decision.

Even my wife, who has no interest in cars, likes it. The interior has just had some minor upgrades and seems fine to me. The seats are comfortable and the controls come to hand nicely. Very little noise gets inside the car either. Unfortunately this also makes the car's occasional squeeks from the roof latches stand out more. I guess GM has a fix coming soon for this problem. Another niggle is the occasional nanny warnings from the computer. You can't open the doors with the engine running and it'll even warn you if you leave the turn signal on too long.","Power, handling.  Reasonably comfortable to live with daily.

I love this car. I had many new cars over the years but this car is special. The ride is very good. It is surprisingly comfortable as a daily driver. The coupe has lots of cargo space. The handling is excellent. With 430 hp the power is endless. No trouble hitting holes in traffic. The looks are amazing. I get so many compliments on this car. I've heard complaints about cheap interior but I think it looks and feels great. The heated leather sport seat are comfortable. I have no regrets just sorry I didn't buy it sooner. It is amazing!","The power, ride quality, handling, looks, comfort",GM needs to install lifter arms on the rear hatch.

Having owned the car less than two weeks I can say this is absolutely the best automobile I have owned. The performance and acceleration is superb. The looks are unmatched and pricing for this American supercar is right on. The Z06 is not an economy car but highway mileage in the mid 20's is not disappointing.",My favorite features of this supercar are styling and performance. The Z06 gives me the feeling of complete control and safety in traffic environment.

I love the Nav System. The Z51 package is a must. Chrome wheels. The 3LT PEG gives you all you need (headsup display, heated seats, memory pkg, Bose). Six-Speed Paddle Shift w Auto modes, you have a standard without a clutch and an automatic. Remove the Roof Panel and you really improve the looks, more folks turn their heads as you drive past. With premium gas the cost to drive is less than my F150. The cost of insurance is also less than my truck.","Dual mode exhaust gives this Vette 436 hp. Floor it from a stop or while moving 20-40mph - the wheels spin very little and the sound. You have to be there. The C6 design is the best Vette produced. Never cared for the pop up headlights, and when they went away I knew I was going to buy one.","Learning about the tires was a little scary. 1 nail repair, half of the life of the tire was gone. 2 repairs  replace the tire ($400 ea).

Best new feature is the LS3 v8 engine. 436 hp and sooooo silky smooth! Glad I made the upgrade from a 05 C6 coupe.

I use to say that the best build quality was the 67 until I purchased the 1999 and the most aggressive looking body style and bay far the best bass sound from the bose stereo was the 95. However, the 2008 coupe is by far the best overall corvette I have ever owned. My 99 was a great car with the z51 handling package but I picked up my 2008 and drove it 800 miles in 2 days and it hands down has the best ride and driver seat comfort.

It is no Porsche but it no longer a fancy or more powerful mustang or camaro either. Try it you will love it. I sold my E500 for this I am am thrilled with it the new 6.2 is breathtaking and the optional exhaust can't be described must be heard.

The new c6 has a much nicer interior, much tighter and quiter ride, much better shifting and steering and last, but not least, the power of the new engine.

I love that car.""  He's a really good kid so I gave it to him (he's very happy), then started looking.  I didn't know much about the C6, got a recommended dealer to send me a brochure, decided going from Z06 to base is not cool.  He had a red one with 2LZ and a black one with 3LZ coming in within the next two months and I bought the red one.  He took pictures of it being unloaded.  It is awesome.  I ran out of space in Suggested Improvements, so will add:  Be sure you know what you get in 3LZ before you order it.  I'm not too sure about that one for $3500.",The fender flares and the styling generally.  I like the styling better than that of the C5. They seem to go angular-round-angular. I like angular. The performance was expected. The handling is better than adequate. The technology inside is like day and night relative to the 2004. ,The paint still shows orange peel. Another reviewer mentioned the deck closing issue.  It's best to open a door.  Big soft pads will deposit a lot of dust but they have made a big improvement in the inner wheel surface material.

From a new Jetstream Blue exterior, a revamped upscale interior, 36HP increase, and a new exhast system the new feature enhancements are extraordinary. The new Jetstream Blue exterior really stands out in the crowd. The 4LT interior (Linen & Ebony) finally puts Corvette in the luxury realm. The 436 HP puts the Vette way above any other car in the price range. The optional Z06 style butterfly exhaust makes the car really sound like a Vette should right from the start.

Feedback response is not as crisp as the S2000, but its good enough to instill confidence. The interior is so much better now, it feels like a luxury sports car (on-star, turn-by- turn navigation, radio frequency keyless entry/start, coach-like leather, and tactile sensation of each dial/button, phone).
