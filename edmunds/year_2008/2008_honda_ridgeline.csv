Additionally, Hondas are very reliable and the build quality on this truck is amazing. I expect, like my 2000 Accord, it will run for a long time with out serious repairs. The handling and comfort are excellent in all weather. This truck will handle all road conditions with confidence. I recently took it off road through some very rugged trails near the ANF and it got me there and back with ease. It is big and heavy and you pay for that in gas mileage. I consistently get 20 mpg on the highway, however I don't mind as the view, safety and comfort while driving are worth it.

It handled beautifully, too.  Interior was spacious in the front and the back, plenty of room for 4 adults, and 5 if necessary. The rear seat swinging up came in handy.  The inbed trunk is huge and was great for storing various items, including a golf bag.  The only negative I can give this is that I live in Philadelphia and it got a little less than 15 mpg.

My feet were freezing, mechanic said you can either have warm feet and not much windshield defrost or vise versa. Second problem, steering box under the left front wheel broke at about 7,000 miles. Next, the rear left lens cover let water in the tail light, and now, heat/ac completely gone at 26,000. I didnt realize I would become best friends with my mechanic.

4,"Solid, but not great.",Loyal Honda Man ,12/15/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,3,4,3,4,"Purchased Ridgeline to be the ""family car,"" and in that function, it has performed satisfactorily.  After almost 30,000 miles, it has been perfectly reliable, and has been a solid all-around-family-vehicle.  Fuel econ has been 15-16 in town, 18-20 on highways.  The engine is adequate if underwhelming for normal use but simply inadequate for towing much of anything.  I towed a mid-sized trailer of approx. 2,500 lbs on level ground and the engine worked very hard and with mileage of only 9-10mpg.  It is, however, very functional and the interior cabin space is efficiently maximized.  LOVE the in-bed trunk, built-in bed cleats, as well as the built-in lighting for the truck bed.","EVERYTHING about the bed: trunk, tie- down cleats, lighting, built-in liner, etc.  The cabin is near perfect.  Being able to fold up the rear seats for tall objects is great.  It is a good utility vehicle that will fit in your garage.",Having a more powerful engine would make this vehicle perfect.

No, it is not overly powerful, but it does have enough power to do what I need it to.  No, it is not overly roomy, but it does have a lot of functional space when configured that way.  No, it is not a looker, but there are worse.  You WILL be able to fit it in a garage, move moderate sized trailers easily at 55-60 mph. You will also get about an average of 16 miles/gal overall.  I have gotten up to 23 (once) and as low as 12 (many times) in the winter.  You can fit 5 smaller people comfortably.  Not if they are over 200 lbs and 6 ft tall.

The in bed storage is a large plus. Overall, I'd buy something else if I had it to do over, I want a better hp/weight ratio which would also help fuel mileage.

If you switch the button off the truck will launch hard indicating Honda should rethink the programming.

The engine is powerful, but seems to strain just a little when trying to pass with a cab full of people or a load being towed.

I find the front seats are not comfortable on long drives and my back ends up very sore. My truck has been to two different dealerships a total of 7 times for tailgate issues and the problem is still not fixed correctly. After a year, the driver door seal wore out and had to be replaced. The paint is very soft and scratches very easily so I do not recommend a dark color (mine is a dark red).",The in bed trunk is very cool.

You can comfortably sit 3 across the back, or fit a 4x8 sheet of plywood in the bed. A lot has been written about this truck, so I really will only add that I am more impressed with this truck after owning it for a year than I was when I first bought it!

The storage spaces are very well designed from the sunglass holder to the pull forward center console that reveals additional CD storage to under seat storage in the rear.

It ended up being the rear differential that was locking. It only happens in 30 degree or less weather. I live in Charlotte, NC it usually doesn't get cold here, but it has. So if you experience this locking of wheels you now know what it is.Thanks warranty",Entire truck especially truck for the summer. It takes 6 bags of ice to fill it up.,Make Honda check problems when owners first bring vehicles in.

Granted, people told me the Ridgeline wasn't a ""true"" truck, well that's all right with me! Drives like my Accord V6 - but with loads of space to haul or tow things. Super comfortable, super styling, and Honda reliability - how can you go wrong??","All the storage features - inside and out! Plus, to be able to take my family (two kids under 3), and stow strollers and diaper bags - without even having to leave exposed in the truck bed - awesome!",An iPod jack and bluetooth without the needed navigation.

I have towed boats and trailers with no problems. Brakes work well while towing but fuel mileage drops to 10 MPG or less. Shifts a lot even without a trailer - very annoying. I think the engine could handle it if the tranny would wait to drop out of high gear. I noticed torque steer when passing, it surprised me and made me swerve. Trunk is awesome. Drives and parks like a car. Fuel mileage is only so-so. Averaging 17-18 and 19-20 on hwy. Functionally the truck is great. It's kind of ugly and my buddies make lots of fun but it's really practical and does what I need it to do.","Trunk is GREAT!

Friends and family tried to steer me towards purchasing a new (08 or 09) Chevy/GM Truck with their current low prices.  I drove and tried to make a deal on both GM products along with a new F-150, but the sales folks couldn't quite get me to where I wanted to be.  The first time I test drove a Ridgeline, I knew this was the vehicle for me.  I don't require the services of a full size truck, so the Honda is the perfect fit for me.

I really wanted a Tacoma, but even with the low car sales plaguing the industry, Toyota didn't want to play.  Honda immediately offered me an incredible deal on this 08 RTS that I didn't need any more incentive- I snatched it up.  This is an incredibly smart truck- all space is usable; seats are comfortable, even in the back where I was concerned most because this often overlooked space is easiest to get cheapest attention (Chevy Colorado). Absolutely the smartest design in this category (if you're looking for heavy hauling, look to full size trucks); fits me like a glove. LUV IT!",Pure genius in their design.  Every nook and cranny wisely used; more comfortable than any other truck in this class; I can see just fine out all windows; only tuck in this class with a three headrests in the back; three fit comfortably in the back- try that with some of the others (Dodge excluded),"Add lights to dash compartments (ash tray); add 12v outlet that stays on without the key; maybe some more horsepower for the vehicle's weight, but not necessary; minor cabin road noise; gear shift lever a bit awkward- I have found myself shifting into 2nd instead of D- duh on my part."

Fog-lights should certainly be standard on the RTL. The front passenger seat is heated, but only the bottom cushion ""due to the side-impact airbags""??

I have been delighted with all aspects of the truck with the exception of the mileage. Although it is not horrible, I would really like to see 25 mpg on the highway. The design features are well thought out and everything is easy to use. Ride comfort is outstanding, although cabin noise could be less. I went to a different tire and noise dropped, but body insulation improvement needs to be worked on by Honda engineers.

Engine could use more low end to reduce shifts. Great upper end power. Seats seem to stain easily. Interior storage is nice. Have noticed some torque steer trying to pass.

However after our first 3 or 4 months we have nothing but good things to say about the vehicle and the service from Honda. Our other vehicle had always been a Toyota so it was nice to see good service at Honda as well. GMC and Especially Ford could learn a lot on how to service customers.

Gas mileage has been exactly as advertised and better.  I routinely get 16-17 in town in the winter and 17-19 in the summer.  Highway mileage has been better than expected, almost always between 21-23 mpg.  Fully loaded with 4 people and 500-600 lbs of camping gear, the truck averaged 22 mpg @ 65-70 mph in varied terrain.

Overall, a very satisfying purchase!","Functional storage areas, great handling, smooth engine and ride quality, solid and dependable.","I have a whistle coming from the driver's side mirror which is really annoying, and I struggle to get comfortable in the front seat."
4.75,Great vehicle for the family,Sparkland ,06/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I've owned my 2008 Ridgeline for about 3 months now and appreciate it more than ever.  It is a great vehicle for the family--lots of room for people and cargo.  The storage is substantial. The swing out tail gate makes it much easier to reach the load in the bed. Rear seating is more comfortable than the competition.  The MSRP is expensive, but the discounts make it affordable. Fuel economy is normal for a 4X4 truck. I am consistently getting 17 mpg in daily city driving. Very nice vehicle for a combination of uses.","Hidden trunk, rear seat comfort, traction in snow and on ice. Swing out tailgate makes reaching items in the bed so much easier.  Storage under the rear seats is substantial.",Accessories are high dollar from Honda.

Great in the snow!  The gas mileage will remind you that it is still a truck, but it is better than most trucks out there!  I am getting about 18-20 mpg, compared to 11-12 on the Durango that I previously owned.  I don't have as much power, but I don't need all of that anyway, especially with $4/gallon gas!  I am very happy with my purchase, and I anticipate that Honda may change the styling a bit by the time my 36 month lease ends.  I definitely plan to purchase another one!","I love the dual action tailgate, swing open, or swing down.  For a truck, it rides extremely well.  The fold up seats in the rear are nice options.  I love the trunk space in the bed...nice option!","Nothing significant.  It would be nice to have a cost-friendlier option for a tailgate cover from the dealer...I am finding that all Honda accessories are expensive!  I could have purchased an after-market cover, but none was as sturdy as the dealer-option.  "

I was pleased with the ride quality and build quality of the Ridge.  This vehicle is very versatile and handles great in poor weather conditions.

A very nice truck and easy to get in and out of and my wife who is 5'1"" tall had no difficulty stepping up and out of the truck.  She said no running boards required for this truck. The truck is very quite and the engine is smooth.  Didn't quite have the get up and go as my 2005 Honda Accord which has a 4 cylinder but still adequate power.  The fuel economy is rated 15 mph for city and 20 mph for highway.  The salesman said the one that he had he averaged about 24 mph highway.  Whether that is true or not I don't know.  The cornering ability was impressive. Overall I think it's a very nice truck and I might just buy one if the price is right.","The seats are comfortable, the composite bed and locking storage is a very nice feature.  I need the lumbar support and really like the electronic seat adjustments.  The tailgate that opens 2 ways, that is nice.  The electric rear window that slides open is a nice feature as well.  Storage is good.","Accessories for this truck from Honda are pricey.  Here's some options that should be standard: telescoping steering column, fog lamps, rear mud flaps, and a much larger rear view mirror with compass and automatic dimming feature for when those bright lights come up behind you.

We actually were looking at replacing our 2005 CR-V with a new one, but discovered we could get the Ridgeline at a much cheaper lease rate. After considering the gas mileage, we went for it and don't regret it. This truck is fantastic, great ride, excellent interior design and the trunk below the box is wonderful. We have used it to haul items from Lowe's and bring other things to the dump and forgot how nice it was to have a truck.

We use our truck basically to take trash to the dump and, occasionally, to get building supplies. We were pleased with the comfort and great ride in the Base RT model, and, since it's not our regular car, decided to get it. I LOVE THIS TRUCK...best we have ever owned. As a Honda/Acura loyal family, we finally got the truck we wanted, too!","Trunk, ride, sound system great for a base truck, back seat features, all the cubbies, fit and finish, standard features","We would have liked the towing package, though we don't tow, just in case."

It's economical for a truck with all wheel drive yet feels more sturdy and rugged than other crew cabs such as the Colorado and Frontier. The leather seats are very comfortable with adjustable lumbar. Sticker was 36,002, invoice was 32,401 and I got mine for 28,285. That did not even count the 7,000 trade in I got. I'm moving to Oregon next month so we'll see how it does in the snow. They are great trucks and now at unbeatable prices. ",The fact that its front wheel drive until it senses traction loss then all wheel drive kicks in seamlessly. Quiet cabin even at 80 mph. Very smooth ride.,The only thing I found that was odd for me is the angle of the steering wheel. The top is angled towards the dashboard.

I read from some that the RTL has a large turning radius. Every try to turn a Taco around on a regular street? Can you say 3 pointer!! The Taco was a great truck, reliable, rock solid, but it no creature comforts standard. Manual seats, absolutely no storage in the cab, cramped rear seats, a crappy ride and over all cramped feeling, wimpy A/C and expensive to maintain. The Taco also got 17 MPG, uphill, downhill, city and hi-way! The Ridgeline beats the Taco in all areas, hand down. Plus it's cheaper from the get-go. Honda got it right! Ford/GM not even close!","Rear trunk, comfort, fit and finish second to none. Heated leather seats. Honda reliability at a good price.

I'm a 60 year young guy doing outside sales. My truck is basically my office. In the past I've owned two s-10's one GMC Sonoma and a Ford ranger. The Ridgeline puts them all to shame. Fuel mileage of the Ridgeline was my biggest concern but my fears were for naught as I am averaging 19 mpg combined city/hwy. I can only assume that my mileage will go up as the engine gets broken in.

5,Truck that rides like a car,Mike ,04/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have always been a truck owner and have never been a fan of foreign made trucks.  With gas prices on the rise and every year fewer and fewer trips to Home Depot for home and yard repair, I started looking at something more economic.  I did all of my homework because I needed a crew cab for my family.  I went with the Honda because it offered more for my money.  It was about 5000 cheaper than the Toyota, it has a high resale value, better gas economy, cheaper insurance, and was more comfortable.   I also would note that I do not haul trailers, boats, etc...  for the average Joe this is a vehicle that is family friendly, rides like a car, and looks like a truck!!!","All of the comfort features, nice design for a big man, fits family of four easily, and the hidden storage/cooler/trunk.",Still won't attract most Truck Owners unless it offers a bigger bed and more power.

An easy choice..another Ridgeline. I upgraded to the RTL with navigation. Honda was (maybe still is) having a $3500.00 cash back on new ones. I was able to upgrade from a 2 year old RTS for only 1K more. If you haven't driven one, due yourself a favor and try it before you go and buy another GM clunker. Compare the fit & finish, quality of materials, and the drivetrain refinement. I use a Chevy Silverado for a work vehicle that has a 6 cylinder in it. No comparison! The Chevy revs high and sounds like its going to explode. Chevy also makes the cheapest looking dashboards with hard plastics. Go Honda!","Heated seats & mirrors, Nav, flat floors, flip up seats, voice control, dual climate control, dashboard lighting, pwr rear slider, in bed trunk (of course), hidden wipers, no ugly cheap stick antenna like GM, and never having to go under the hood to fix it.","Bluetooth, HID's, standard trailer hitch included, and the nav should have the text to speech option like my Garmin.

We got a six inch snow the day that I bought the Ridgeline.  The 4WD with vehicle stability assist (VSA) is an excellent performer.

I owned trucks (Frontier, Tacoma), cars (Forester, Matrix), and have finally settled on a Ridgeline.  I chose the base model and is has plenty of equipment. I am one who likes vehicles loaded. This one is not loaded, but for a truck is equipped well enough for me. The ride is the best part.  It rides like a car and is extremely quiet inside. My wife loves it in the snow. We had some snow in PA and she bragged about how she was in the passing lane while 4X4 full sized trucks were fishtailing in the slow lane. I chose the base model to try it.

I have had them all and this Ridgeline is by far the best of the group.  It can only tow about 6000 pounds, but that is not my primary use.  It has been getting 21-22 hwy, 18ish mixed and 15-17 around town in pure stop-go traffic.  Every time I drive it, I like it even more.  The things they think of and incorporated in this vehicle are amazing.  I wondered in the beginning why they made some things the way they did, and over time, everything makes perfect sense.

I wanted a SUV or truck that has 4WD/AWD, that is more fuel efficient than the Tahoe and priced closer to $30K than $40K.  In the end, the vehicle that fit me (6'-4"")and my criteria best was the Ridgeline.  Now that I've had it for a couple of weeks I am confused with the two most common complaints that I read during my pre- purchase research - gas mileage and power.  To the issue of gas mileage, it compares very well with every other 6 cylinder powered vehicle out there.  As to power, it is very capable in town and on the highway, but again, it's a 6.  In the end, the Ridgeline is great at being what it is.","Cabin space, storage features and the navigation system with voice control (you can use verbal commands to operate the navigation, audio and climate control systems) are all well thought out.

Second the interior, because of Honda's flat floor design fits 5 people better than a Toyota Camry.  Then there is the fact that you get all wheel drive.  So while the big rear wheel drive trucks are sliding around in the snow the Ridgeline hugs the road.  I live in a marine community and 5000lbs towing is enough for pulling boats.

I love being able to flip the seats up for extra space and being able to fit five adults if need be.  I cannot stress how well this truck handles and how comfortable this truck is to drive. We've had some snow in the north east recently, and the AWD worked exceptionally well.  There are a few design quirks (placement of cruise control on/off switch, cavernous space below wipers for snow to gather), this is a great vehicle overall.","Ride comfort, versatility, under bed lockable/weather proof storage, reliability, and overall enjoyable driving experience.

It feels better than my wifes Lexus 470 and that's no knock on the 470.
