It goes through brakes but it has otherwise been faultless.  Still love driving it.  Same great ride, no rattles and no issues.

Interior is top notch and I even prefer it to the 2012 loaner A6 I am driving this week.Fuel economy is outstanding and the car just glides at 90mph.However, the CVT transmission is quirky and I would opt for the Quattro next time around.Car is sluggish off the mark and much of that is around the CVT. I had it in twice this year for rough idle and jerky driving when cold. Also, Audi refuses to update their software in a timely manner for the Media Center and is behind the curve of technology despite what the commercials tell you. Remote doesn't roll down windows and no streaming music from your phone to Bluetooth.","Ride, trunk space, quietness and quality of cabin interior.","Get rid of the CVT and provide media software updates for your current loyal owners (its called building affinity in the marketing business).

4.25,Frustrating,johnc8551 ,01/14/2011,,,4,5,5,3,,4,5,4,4,"This is my first experience wiuth Audi after owning Volvos, SAABs, and BMWs. I bought the car this past summer with 32K miles on the Audi CPO program. The brakes are touchy/grabby, but I've learned that's a common trait with the A6, and I've learned to live with it and adjust. At 36K miles, the engine quit in traffic, and I had to have it towed to the dealer for repair. It turned out to be a faulty low fuel pressure sensor, and this was repaired under warranty. The following week, a simple daylight running light bulb went out, and this an only be repaired at the dealer! ","MMI, not a Mercedes or BMW, heated seats, Nav system. Very roomy and comfortable interior. Wood trim and interior accent lighting.",Make simple things like changing a common light bulb so it can be done by the owner OR extend the warranty on bulbs to 5 years/50K miles. Paying an hour or more labor to change a light bulb is expensive and should not be necessary. Move the MMI controls more into the driver's vision. 
5,Bought New - My 3rd and best A-6,Douglas ,11/22/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my third Audi A-6 (had a 2000 and 2004 A-6 turbo 2.7 models). I thoroughly enjoy the car. It is by far the best vehicle I've owned. Drove it down to Virginia and back two weeks ago moving with traffic at 75+ and averaged 28 mpg on the highway. It accelerates nicely in Sport mode, has lots of room. The only real annoying problem I had occurred at 46,000 miles - the starter relay switch went - the car just wouldn't start one rainy evening. I had to have the car towed, however Audi gave me a loaner, paid for the tow and repaired it quickly. It has more interior room than the Mercedes E  and BMW 5 series. I highly recommend this car.","The Iphone integrated blue tooth navigation and I-Pod system works very nicely. Lots of leg room front and back. Great overall performance with 4 wheel 'Quatro' drive - great on the snow, water and gravel surfaces. I like the summer sunscreens package and key less entry.",The turning radius at 39 is too big for comfortable maneuverability in tight spaces - decrease it to 36'. Adaptive Cruise control and lane change warning systems would be great along with a Remote Starter. Add the A-8 seat massager and air cooled seats and you will need nothing more.
4.875,Bought used,Lane O. ,09/22/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought from Schaumburg Audi with 75k.  Dealer and their service area have been awesome.  Haven't seen service levels like theirs in any commercial area for a long, long time.  LOVE the style of the '08 and '09 A6s.  Preferred the turbo engine in the '09, but I was too cheap.

3.75,Not sure if it's worth it,audiowner ,09/19/2010,,,4,5,2,1,,4,5,4,5,"Amazing car to drive in the winter. The car looks great and is subtle but still turns heads. Great sound system and love the rear heated seats. But, the reliability on this car is horrible. I've never been to a dealership this many times. The check engine light has come on today for the 7th time in the last two years. I don't care what the excuse is, a new 50k car should not have these kind of problems this early on with this few miles. I'm getting annoyed with this car, despite it's capabilities during the winter. I wish Honda could just buy out their quattro awd system. It'd be the perfect marriage.","Great AWD system, comfortable interior and great styling.",Engine reliability. It's pathetic how many times this car has had to be in the shop. 
3.875,Poor Audi Quality,JWW ,09/16/2010,,,5,4,3,3,,4,4,4,4,"I am not impressed with Audi build quality or reliability.  In the first month of ownership, I had to have the dealer replace a howling power steering pump.  The car has a sunroof water leak that the dealer can't fix.  The floor gets wet in a hard rain storm. Otherwise, performance and handling are quite good as are the electronics on the car.","Vehicle dynamics(steering and handling are excellent. I like the electronics integration of the navigation, voice command and overall information display.  The interior is very high quality.","Improve the build quality.  Everything I feared about buying a German car is coming true.  Having had numerous Lexus and Infiniti, I will go Japanese again on my next car.  Lexus dealer experience is far superior to Audi."
4.75,"So far, so good",Mark ,05/27/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"First luxury car I have owned and very pleased after two years; lots of bells and whistles, even on the standard model (only option was i-pod interface).  Build quality excellent - solid as a bank vault.  Only complaints are touchy brakes, accelerator lag, and annoying buzzes and rattles that I mostly fixed by stuffing cracks with felt.  Great gas mileage 22-37 mpg. ",Blaupunkt stereo best I ever had.  12- way power seat very comfortable for a tall guy with back problems.  S-line trim and five-spoke wheels very attractive,
3.75,Not what I was expecting,goodmaj ,04/10/2010,,,5,4,4,4,,3,4,4,2,"I sold my M3 because my kids were getting too big for the back seat and my wife couldn't drive a stick.  I owned a 2004 Allroad at one point and loved it so I thought it'd be cool to come back to Audi.  Well, now it's three weeks later and I just sold it for a BMW 535.  The seats, while nice, offer very little support when going through hard turns.  The headroom is terrible - I'm 6' 3"" and my hair brushed the headliner every time.  The car is very smooth - almost too smooth.  I felt like I was driving a luxury yacht.  Performance of the V8 is pretty good and with good mileage.  If you like to float in luxury, this is your car, but if you're looking for a little better driving experience, pass.","V8, interior design (no one, but no one beats an Audi interior), MMI easy to figure out quickly and use, center dashboard display (vs. always having to look at the MMI screen).  Bose Surround is very nice.",Tighten up the suspension on the base model.  Beef up the seats and make them more adjustable.  Shrink and fatten the steering wheel so you don't feel like you're steering the Titanic.
4,Annoying quirks,chicagotiger ,03/30/2010,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Our Audi for the most part has been fabulous. However in the 2 years we've owned the car, we've only put 7,500 on it and our check engine light has come on 3 times.  Perhaps its dishonest gas pumps, but we always use the premium gas.  Its very annoying to have to take it in for service, get no real details,  a couple of dings on the car and not even a car wash at our local dealership.  Even though its been a nice ride for the most part,  I'd like to get rid of it before something major blows.",,
4.25,Not happy!,Robert ,03/12/2010,,,5,5,4,3,,4,5,4,4,"Well have had my a6 for just 2 yrs now and 40,000 miles and the problems just keep on coming. First was the seat controls separating from the seat at 17,000 and not covered under warranty charged $40 to tighten bolt. Next was the xenon headlight going on and off, dealer said it was what they do when they are about to go bad $350. Then car started to run rough and engine light on told computer issue but that did not fix it. Then back to shop to find out it was carbon build up. Major engine work, fixed under warranty this time otherwise over $1,000 to fix. Dealer said that its because the gas today is not high enough octane to work with audis new engine design. Whats next? My last Audi.",comfort of the ride and looks,Audi needs to work on the quality issues and stop blaming their problems on low octane gas for their new poor engine design
4,Plagued with problems,RNayar ,01/26/2010,,,5,5,3,3,,4,4,4,4,My A6 continues to be plagued with problems. Spent 10 days in the shop over thanksgiving. Oil seals on all 6 cylinders had to be replaced. A major job on a car with only 12k miles. The carbon buildup issue which was initially attributed to a computer reprogram turned out to be failing seals. I also mentioned a rattle/squeak from the front left suspension; dealer greased the suspension per Audi directives but to no avail. Car was in the shop for 1 week. Now it turns out that it may be a bushing problem (a known issue amongst Audis) and I am being asked to take the car back again.  BTW - JDPower only gives the A6 a 6 rating which is on the cusp of below average. ,"When its out of the shop and firing on all cylinders, the A6 is an exciting, enjoyable car to drive. ","Reliability, reliability, reliability."
5,Better than Expected,Corey ,01/12/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"For a large car, the A6 handles very well. I come from a smaller sports car so driving the A6 took some getting used to. The steering is soft, but responsive. Starts are slow, but once she's up to speed, the power is awesome! Passing slower vehicles is not a problem. The interior is plush and comfortable and there's nothing better when driving at night with all the lights on. Having the controls on the console was awkward at first since it is difficult to change settings while driving. I don't suggest it! However, once set up, voice activation is the key to easy and safe operation. Although difficult to comprehend at first, once learned, the MMI and navigation system is a cinch to use.",The Bose stereo is awesome!  I've never enjoyed listening to music in any car I've owned as much as I do in the A6. Having multiple screens for on- board information is great. It allows the driver to see the radio stations while having the navigation system displayed.,Improve torque for quicker starts. The sluggish start-off can be a problem when starting off from a full stop.

I know that there are cars that are quicker, better handling, flashier, more powerful, etc, but no other car, taken as a package, does it all better than this A6.  Can't beat quattro in the snow and rain.  After 17K miles:  NO PROBLEMS AT ALL, just changing the oil every 5K (not the factory recommended 10K).","V8 power, acceleration, interior design.

3.5,1st Audi A6 review,rnayar ,10/26/2009,,,4,5,3,2,,3,4,3,4,"Beautifully designed inside and out. Great drive. BOSE sound system is incredible.  My A6 performed flawlessly the 1st year but then problems started. At 9k miles the # 5 cylinder coil had to be completely replaced. At 10k miles, carbon buildup caused the check engine light to come on again. The on-board computer had to be reprogrammed. In addition to all this, Audi's consume oil like no other car I've ever owned. I literally have to drive around with a quart of oil in my trunk because it needs to be constantly topped up. 5 times this year alone.  Finally, the front suspension is starting to creak on rough roads and it's getting progressively louder.  Disappointing for a car this new.","Bose sound system, MMI interface and IPOD connectivity.",Overall engine reliability and perhaps an attempt to design an engine that consumes less synthetic oil.
4.875,She's beautiful,Wes ,09/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I'll agree with the editor's reviews that the low-end torque is an issue. She's just a bit slow off the starting line, but she shines once she's on the road. There's plenty of pedal when you need it, and I think she runs the best slightly above the recommended speed limit. I've owned Toyota's, BMW's and of course American cars. The Audi is my favorite to date. You won't be sorry, if you go this direction. I'm always getting compliments on this car, yet you don't feel too ""cocky"" driving it.",The MMI is awesome. Passing power on the highway is terrific. Highway mileage has been much better than expected. I had a 6 hour drive recently and was getting 31 MPG!!,"Low-end torque.

The car is beautify, spacious, and has more gadgets than we need but the kids love it. The ride is spectacular. However, in just 14 months we have had to take the car back 5 times for check engine light. One of the Cylinders (#5) they tell us is bad. The car has stalled on my wife stranding her and my daughter at the side of the road. We are delighted with their road-side assistance and loaner program but frankly miffed that we've had to use it about every other month. At this time we are not happy with our decision.

However the jury is still out on the handling. The car seem to have a lot of play in the steering and very poor weight distribution, also I find the car to have poor visibility.  The Navigation System and Blue Tooth leaves a lot to be desired.  (German car engineers should take note of Japanese technology). The S line looks great with its wider tires, but has very stiff seats.

About 6 weeks later we have no regrets. It's styling and build easily surpass its competitors. The MMI is not that difficult to learn. My wife, no techie, but has mastered it and is now a big fan of the system. It just takes a little patience to learn a new way of doing things. iPod interface is excellent and the NAV system is very well implemented. Lane assist is a great safety feature and works well. I much prefer the Audi to BMW, MB or Lexus. For us, the runner up was the Infinity M35.","Quattro, MMI, great iPod interface, 2 screen NAV system, exterior and especially interior styling and finish, really quiet and smooth on highway, MPG is excellent with V6, lane assist, keyless entry, rearview camera and sensors, great trunk. lighting accents in cabin at night","Front distance sensors should be added, automatic steering wheel should retract both up and in on exiting car (not just up).

Although this car is fantastic in so many ways,the lack of road feel and poor wieght distribution is very unsettling. I can't understand why they would build a great car, but which lacks basic handling characteristics.  My daughter's '06 Accord has much better road feel and handling characteristics than this car. I would even go so far as to say this car is quite dangerous if you try to drive it on a curvy road at high speed. The V8 is too much power for the poor handling.

5,Perfect Car,Black Audi ,05/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We have had the car for about 6 months and it is a perfect family wagon. It has plenty of room for a family of four and a dog. It gets about 25 mpg in mixed driving and 29 on a recent highway trip. I have been a Japanese car fan for the last 10 years after several BMWs left me wanting something with less maint. down time. I saw that the Audi reliability ratings were getting to a point that I felt comfortable giving an Audi a try. It's only been 6 months, but so far not one problem. We also live in New England and wanted all wheel drive, but we didn't want a truck. It was great in the snow and handles like a sports car on the dry pavement.","All wheel drive, MPG, performance, fit and finish, and reliability. ",None
5,A Fine German Piece of Engineering,Tom M ,05/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was in the market for an all-wheel drive german executive car, so my choices were the MB E350 4Matic, BMW 535xi, or the Audi A6 3.2, and I went with the Audi. And I really think I made the right choice. I don't like the idea that underneath it's a Passat, but the interior styling is unmatched and look nothing alike. The Quattro system works beautifully in all conditions. I'm getting about 31MPG average, which is great for this sized car. I'm just slightly disapointed with the acceleration. When merging on a highway(especially in NJ!), it's somewhat lazy and throttle response isn't as immediate as I hoped for. Like all Audi.s, the ride is firm, so beware of long trips. ",Audi SatNav is wondeful. Heated seats can melt your bottom in minutes. Quattro system. Solid ride and feel. Roomy back seats. Large trunk. Fuel comsumption. Nice engine sound (when it feels its ready to rev) Great handling. Hasn't gone wrong once. ,"Some VW features should be changed, even though very little is wrong. Things like having the same key as a VW Beetle, the cheap VW feeling seats, the same gear shift column as a VW all should be slightly modified. Maybe next year a facelift would be warrented. "
5,Close to a 10,Steve ,04/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My third A6 offers loads of improvements over its earlier siblings. Ride is significantly more solid. Handling is so precise it's like a vacuum sucking the backtop. Engine performance is powerful and at least 10% more economical than the 3.0 in my previous 2003 A6. Views are stimulating from approaching the vehicle to behind the wheel. Several minor cost cutting steps should be noted: more narrow seats and thinner cushions than the previous models, door pockets are ""cheaper,"" manual fuel filler door replaces and automatic release, head restrants no- longer swivel. I also miss oil temp. and volt gauges. ",MultiMedia Interface (MMI) which allows customization of passive vehicle features and controls radio and bluetooth/telephone functions are in easy reach and easy to learn. Cruise is more intuitive. Design and assembly details both in and out beats everything else in its class.,With the 6-CD changer in the glove box there is no handy storage for items that need to be out of sight. Bring back swivel head restrants.
4.875,Amazing Vehicle,Awesome! ,04/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"This is my second Audi A6 and this is an entirely new vehicle that was redesigned from the bottom up. On a 350 mile trip at avg speed of 75mph I got 30 MPG!  Quiet cabin, great ergonomics,and the NAV is the best I have ever seen. The sound system is fantastic. Headlights are improved. I did find the sunroof to be a little small but it is not as important compared to all the positives.",Navigation. Stereo. Awesome headlights. Cruise control features are much improved. Heated steering wheel is very nice. ,Slightly wider seats would be nice. The performance could be improved. I miss the old turbos!
5,2008 Audi A6,Gary ,01/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Driving dynamics are brilliant. The car rides like a train on the rails. There is no slipping nor sliding. Quattro system makes sure of that. Every mechanical component works in total harmony with each other. The interior appointments must be an envy of every other automaker. From the incredible ergonomics to the impeccable attention to the slightest details, this car clearly is a winner.","Warm cabin environment combined with easy and intuitive use of every accessory make this car stand out from the crowd. MMI, heated steering wheel, Interior lighting, keyless entry & start, navigation system, rear electric sunshade are among my favorites. ","Transmission downshifts are rather rough but contribute to the dynamic braking effort. Ventilated seats would be useful addition and should be offered, at least as an option in this price range."
5,Top Notch Performance - All Year Round!,MMMPower!!! ,10/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have owned Lexus, BMW, Volvo, Jaguar, Acura and this is my second Audi.  Living in Canada with the relatively harsh winters and hot/humid summers I have found that the Quattro system in the Audi is by far the best I have ever driven for all year driving.  Interior fit and finish and the intuitive design/layout make it something that I haven't had to this extent in any of the previously owned or tested cars.  Each time my lease is up I go out and test each of the previously mentioned manufacturers, plus Infiniti, and go through all the pros and cons, including cost, performance, all year maintenance, and passion for the car.  Service has been top notch! Great car all around.","MMI, comfortable seats, all year drivability with the amazing Quattro system, interior fit and finish.","All my previous model issues have been resolved with the new car.  Length, it just fits in my garage, haha."
5,The Beast ,Marcus ,09/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"With this car I am fully in control and it grabs the ground like an ice pick to ice, the growl of the engine just makes you wanna go faster and faster, this car is by far better than any BMW out there, with its AWD platform you can make curves like they were straight lines.",My favorite feature is that if you go without satellite service the navigation will be within 3 inches from where you left off.,Offer an RS6.
5,The Manufacturer to Follow!,Little League Umpire ,08/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We researched, watched and waited for just the right sedan to come to market.  I compared features, performance, comfort and reliability for all sedans in the A6 category and there is no other car that would rank higher than 8.5 now or in the next years model.  The steering capability with the S-Line sports suspension is what makes driving this car so much fun yet comfortable.  I love the unique color (Daytona Grey) in a time when almost everything on the road is the same.  The ability to power hard into your corners smoothly will never make you feel like you purchased something second rate.  The MMI is fabulous and intuitive.  My wife went from the A4 to this and just loves it immensely.","You feel like you're driving an A8 without paying for one.  The right amount of acceleration, size and sportiness while enjoying maximum comfort.  The MMI w/ navigation, bluetooth, Bose sound is easy to use.  The exterior color changes depending on the time of day.  It makes my wife happy.",More interior color choices.
5,2008 Audi A6 4.2 - The Perfect Car,bofam ,08/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My previous car was a Porsche Cayenne S, a 350 hp nimble beast of an SUV. It was a blast to drive. I thought I would never find a replacement. The Porsche is a distant memory now that I am driving the Audi A6 4.2. It is nice to be driving a sedan instead of an SUV. The ride is super smooth, quiet and with 350 hp this car can really take off. Audi has done a fantastic job with the fit and finish as well as integrating state of the art technology without overloading the instrument bay. The outside of the car is elegant and tasteful. The 2008 A6 4.2 comes standard with the S-Line font grille and bumpers which add a nice flare to the body.","I love the push button start, Bose sound system, navigation system, the bluetooth phone integration and voice commands.",It is hard to find anything wrong with this car but if I have to find something to complain about it would be a desire to have easier access to the second cup holder. It is located underneath the center arm rest so you have to lift the arm rest when you want to use it. I think I can live with that.
