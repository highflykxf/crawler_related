5,Great car!,LoveMyRio! ,08/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my Rio to use as a commuter car to/from work.  I wasn't sure I would like it but when I test drove it, I was pleasantly surprised.  After 2 months, I just hit 3000 miles and I usually get 33-35 mpg. but did get 38.3 last week on a 3 hr. trip!! I love the way the car handles and it is so much fun to drive. Love the way the rear seats fold down too, so much room.  Also, love the way they laid out the instrument panel/radio.  Very easy to reach and use, much more than any other car I have owned.  I LOVE this car and look forward to it lasting a long time.  Highly recommend it!","MPG, Instrument panel, comfort, roominess, fun to drive, handling, ",
4.75,New Rio 5 LX,Peter ,07/29/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,5,5,"We got the 2008 Rio 5 LX with 5-speed manual.  We are very pleased with our choice so far.  The car is attractive, fun to drive, and it is good enough power-, handling-, and feature-wise for us.  Shortly after break-in, we took the car to TX (1800+ miles each way).  Never dawdling, with two adults and two kids, fully loaded with toys and gear, we got 33 mpg.  Not bad!  It would do better, though, if Kia put a 6-speed in this model.  3500+ revs in 5th for typical Southern and Western U.S. interstate driving is too much.  If I often drove on Southern or Western interstates, I would be less pleased with the car.  But in the hilly, trafficky Northeast, where I live, I highly recommend it!","The overall combination of price, space, performance, safety, and economy are hard to beat!  We'll see about reliability, mine's only two months old.","Give this a 6-speed, for heaven's sake!  I understand that it takes low gearing to get good performance from a 1.6cc engine. But give us a 6th gear to make up the difference.  It's so absurd that the auto gets better highway mileage than the manual that it counts as a tranny design flaw in my book."

4.5,Keen on Kia,Garret ,07/05/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,5,5,I just recently bought this vehicle as my daily commuter to work and school in an effort to save on gas and help the environment. I'm very pleased with my purchase. The car drives very well for what it is and the motor is surprisingly efficient. The only change that I made is I replaced the air filter with a K&N unit. Would recommend this vehicle to others.,"I like the fact that the car is so small, and very easy to pilot. ","The addition of a little more power would go a long way, possibly a turbo charged option for even better gas mileage."
4.75,Rio5  not well known but a good car,rs ,06/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I bought this car as a commuter car. It is great. I get 34 mpg combined driving. It is cute, the girls love it. I did not buy it for that though. It made sense to me a good value in a nice package. I drive a lot and was driving a big truck, the monthly payment and gas for this car is cheaper than the gas for my truck. I read many reviews on the internet and reliability is up there too. For a sub compact it is quiet. Lots of features for the money. It has a small engine but has enough power to get me up hills at the speed limit. I'm very happy with it.","Roomy interior, well made, gas sipping not guzzling, comfortable, 5/4 star crash rating, I got the power package option.","better crash rating for back seat (3 star), a few more factory options, better stereo, alarm, adjustable passenger seat like drivers. overall though no big complaints."
5,Excellent gas sipper,Glenn ,06/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"If you're looking for an inexpensive ride that's great on gas, the Kia Rio is all you need! I bought the 4 door base to use as my ""run around"" car and I am getting 39 MPG based on about a 60% stop-and-go and 40% highway driving ratio. It's the best no frills car out there, easily the best bang for the buck. I never thought I'd buy a Kia/Hyundai, but with gas prices being what they are and just needing some basic wheels, this car hits the target dead on! ","GAS MILEAGE!!! Also, the seats are comfortable, even for a 6' 4"" guy like me. I have plenty of leg and head room.","5 speed manual shifts a little hard, especially into third. I'd like to have power steering. "
4.875,Rio5 SX Wagon,Giancarlo ,06/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I traded in my Hyundai Tucson for a car I could use for my working commute. Rio5 SX was a straightforward choice. The car is compact but surprisingly comfortable and spacious. The engine is up to the task considering is a 1.6 L and the car is very fun to drive. In my first tank of gas I've got a good 33 mpg in mix condition (traffic/highway) typical in a commute scenario. Very, very satisfied with this choice that I recommend to anybody in need of a good, reliable commuting car. ","I love the design. I went for a SX model with full optional and I think made the difference. The 18"" alloy tire, the interiors, the power windows, fog lights, the tire pressure system, the heated mirrors, etc. are all optionals worthy the $1,200 price tag. However the gas mileage is the main feature",

The difference in gas price alone amounted to over $200/Mo. which is a good portion of the payment. Nimble, sure, and attractive lines (IN my opinion). I could not be more pleased. I like the fact that I did not have to pay for a useless car alarm either. (I think we quit listening to them about a year after they came out). No bloody power this or that to break either and I can reach the passenger window crank without causing a crash on the freeway","Sunset Orange! Style is sweet. Passes gas (Stations).

5,Better than I expected,Aaron Salinas Jr ,05/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I bought the car for my wife to drive to work and save money in gas.  Best thing I ever did we went from 12 to 14 miles to the gallon in the city to 26 to 28 to the gallon in the city.  We cut our gas bill from $75 to $30 per week.  I cannot wait to get it on the highway to see how many miles I can get.  I also bought the car because I am not a small guy and when I first sat in the Rio I was able to get in and out with out hitting my head on the roof.  The space was also a factor and the Rio was a perfect size for wife and me.  The interior has enough space to place the 3 kids in the back seat and stuff in the trunk.,"Body design and the interior, looks sporty and not cheap.",none for me.

I've been told it will improve after the first 5000 miles, but already I'm getting 32 mpg around town, so I am quite happy with it. My mom drove it and she is used to bigger cars liked its handling, but said she couldn't ride in it on a long trip. She bought an Optima and loves it. She and I both have more leg room than you could ever want, its very surprising. My dad is 6'4 and he couldn't believe it.

It cost her about half to fill the gas tank than it did before and she can drive for almost twice as long. The interior is very sporty with black and red stitched seating.

I average 3-500 mi. a week and this great little car gets 29 in rush hour, and 33+ on the open road.  I like manual transmissions and it was pretty hard to find the one I wanted. This little car has some spunk and I really enjoy driving it around. Seats are nice and the controls are well placed.","The manual transmission.

I haven't taken a long trip yet but hope to get 35 as the sticker says. I had those gawd awful skinny Kumho tires replaced immediately with some more aggressive BF Goodrich T/As.

It's very pleasant at all speeds (never taken it over 80 mpg).  What an amazing value!  I wish I had purchased a car like this sooner.  I listed ""Performance"" as only a 7 because it's not designed to be a race car.  It's a 4-cylinder, therefore performance should be a little sub- par.  That said, I've never had a problem keeping pace at a light, or going uphill.","It's minimalist, simplistic style.  No fluff, no gee-whiz features, no built in GPS.  It's just a car.

On the lot where I bought my Rio were signs on some of the Rios stating 44 mpg.  Now, I know that is highway miles, and the sticker only said 27 city, 34 highway, but something is amiss here.  I am thinking, if I get 44 highway, then I think I should get at least 35 city.  And driving it slower than two thirds of other vehicles, I think that should have been accomplished.
