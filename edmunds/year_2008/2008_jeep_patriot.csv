5,The little Jeep That Could,RWFORD ,09/12/2015,5,3,5,,,5,5,5,4,,,"I bought this car new in 2008 when they offered the lifetime warranty. I also purchased an extended lifetime warranty to cover the non powertrain components. 1st brake job at 95,000 miles. 2nd brake job at 179,000 miles. Runs great nd is a little work horse. 80 foot tree fell on house and this little jeep pulled it off the roof and down the driveway to be cut up. Gas mileage has been as high as 30 mpg in summer months on the highway but always in the 25 mpg combined unless towing. Right now the issue is who's lifetime is going to be the longest the Jeep or mine. The only complaint that I have ever had is the noise during acceleration. As far a being sluggish, I think being able to hit 90 + mph on a freeway entrance is more than acceptable. The real problem is the driver's that think you should enter at 45mph. At this writing I have185,000 + miles and does not use any between oil changes. I have used synthetic since the 1st 1000 miles.",,
4,130k and going strong!,Brian C ,08/28/2015,4,4,3,,,5,4,4,3,,,"Reading some other reviews on here I felt inclined to share my story.I bought my 08 Patriot Limited through a friend who worked at Chrysler.  It was an employee lessee vehicle and had just under 20k miles on it.  It was my first vehicle and I wanted something 4WD as I lived in MI at the time and wanted something that could handle the snow.  I feel this SUV delivers on points that a small SUV should, it handles well and gets good gas mileage(I average 22 on any day).  It is not the prettiest Jeep ever made when it comes to in interior, its cheap plastic dash and instrument panels leave something to be desired, but as for the drive train it has not disappointed.  Other than keeping up with the Breaks and Oil changes not much has been needed as far as maintenance on my Jeep.  I did front breaks at 60k and then did all 4 breaks and rotors at 105k.  At around 90k I heard some clunking in the front end and my neighbor was a mechanic at a dealer who said that the Lower control Arm/Ball Joints tend to wear in the Patriot and I should have it looked at.  I did, and he was correct, they were wearing and needed to be replaced, my mechanic (not a dealer) quoted me ~$750 to do it, I decided to give it a shot myself and finished both sides in a few hours after getting the parts at Advanced.  Other than the listed items above my Jeep Patriot has been everything I wanted from a first Jeep.  The old adage is true, you get what you pay for, this is a lower cost Jeep when it comes to the Jeep family so they kept costs low on some luxury feature, but kept the money in the critical components.  It handles GREAT in the snow and I recently moved from Michigan to Texas and had to pull 5x8 trailer for the first time, and other than killing the gas mileage it got the job done without any issues (and she was at 120K at the time).  I would buy this car again if I needed another good running, affordable, 4wd, small SUV for my daily life.  My next one will most likely be a Grand Cherokee (unless Ford brings back the Bronco...)",,

3.5,Got Lucky I Guess,dandt1 ,08/19/2014,,,3,5,3,5,,3,3,3,3,"Why won't Edmunds let me select a Patriot Sport 4x4 CVT? After reading all the bad reviews on this car I thought I'd share my experience with our 2008 Jeep Patriot Sport 4x4 CVT.My wife purchased this car by herself brand new in December of 2007 and it currently has 93,000 miles.She wanted AWD and decent gas milage and liked that the Jeep Patriot came with a lifetime power-train warrantee. When I met my future wife, the car was a little over a year old so I've had a lot of experience driving it and dealing with the problems.","Honestly, I had very little expectations for this car.
In the past I had bad luck with a 1998 Jeep Cherokee and didn't think the brand or Chrysler were putting out good products at the time.
However, we've had very few problems with this car and I have to say that it has been very reliable so far.
The exterior styling is probably my favorite feature.
It also is comfortable on long trips and has good freeway manners.
","Like others have said we had to replace both left and right front lower control arms (ball joints). This was done at the dealer and was $$$$$. (700?)

The sunroof leaked a couple times, but I cleaned out the drain tubes and it's been fine since (we live in Seattle). 

The front right wheel speed sensor failed but was covered under warrantee. (the part is only $25) 

The ESIM (evaporative system integrity monitor) broke and threw a check engine light code (gas cap) but was an easy fix for me to do. The part was expensive about $$80.00 on ebay. 

That's it in nearly 100,000 miles. (besides new brakes, battery) So I think it's pretty good."

1.625,Highly Defective Substandard Suv,truth1hurts ,03/08/2014,,,2,2,1,1,,2,3,1,1,"We bought the 2008 Patriot new for $25k and within a few months endured unjustifiable anxiety for unrelenting warranty repairs on an inferior made cheap product. First and last time Jeep buyers, the 5-speed manual transmission went through 4+ major warranty repairs: clutch, transmission, defects, gear box, ball bearings, etc. It had to be towed a few times to the car lot. We lost value and money in a headache suv that was highly defective and unreliable and dismissed trips too. Very poor car, dealership, head office and managers. Stacks of warranty repair files amplifies our deserved poor rating of the car and all involved. ","The only positive things was the government rebate. Otherwise, it fell short of meeting our needs and expections with poor value. If you examine ratings of former owners and experts you'll see many unhappy folks. The negatives far exceed the positives. This driver would not recommend the 2008 Patriot. The manager wrote a letter on our behalf; years later and too late, and HQ rubber stamped everything the franchise did as following warranty protocols. They tried to get more money from us to buy another off their lot. I wouldn't buy from them if you paid me! The best day was when we traded it off and now are trouble-free for 2.5 years with a superior Suv in our view, a Ford Escape...","This car was cheaply made and the company spent about $13,000.00 on labour, parts and warranty repairs for years; a band-aid on a deep wound - we both lost money but us more! The transmission needs overhauling because it was shameful and indefensible. The back rear window is a poor for tall drivers who have to slouch to see behind them and the engine's power is sluggish on hills and good logging roads. Overall poor quality and deserved low ratings. The vehicle should be higher like a Ford Escape and better power, quality of tires and visibility. Maybe Jeep owners with automatics were lucky but others echoed the same stress. The whole design needs to be revamped and better training for all."
2.25,Terrible with a dash of confusion,buckleyjohn ,02/20/2014,,,2,3,2,3,,2,3,1,2,"First off, I have to agree with everyone here that this is a terrible Jeep.Now, I bought my 2008 Patriot 4x4 Sport with the automatic CVT and 2.4L in New Mexico used in 2010 with about 40k on it.Two days after I bought it, the transmission overheated. They tried to blame it on the fact that the tires didnt match. The front and rear were different profile sized. So, I called them retarded and made them service the transmission by changing the fluid and filter and give me a set of new tires.About 3 months went by. Same thing transmission overheated at 70mph on the highway in the middle of no where. Had to sit in the hot sun for about 3 hours for it to cool down.","No favorite features.

117,000 miles, no body damage, no accidents, minor chips in the paint and minor wear and tear on the inside. I keep my vehicles really nice, have owned a few show cars. Trade in value here in the great state of Alaska. $4000 in 2014. So needless to say, I lost a great deal of money and will never buy another Jeep product again. I traded it in for a Toyota 4 Runner and I am over come with joy.","Transmission: huge issue with overheating and if it does, its about $400 just for a fluid and filter change.

Power: Absolutely none, I could feel the difference when I put my two kids in the back seat.

Alternator: I am on my fourth one in 4 years. They are hard to swap because of the AC system in the way. They sit way low on the engine, get wet and get fried. 

Fuel efficiency: Terrible! The best I ever got was 23mpg on the highway doing 40 in a construction zone. Every day driver here in Alaska, 17mpg. Full size V8 trucks do better.

With all that said, it is still running. If the maintenance is done, it runs. But it has to be precise to the degree of F1 mechanics."

(Just out of curiosity I checked the Jeep dealer in my town and they quoted me 755 dollars!!!!!!! for the 60k servicing.) My advice is ask around. It cant hurt. ,Love the Jeep so far. Its not a race car by any means but Ive never had problems merging or passing or going up hills. CVT performs satisfactory for my needs. Love the great gas mileage! Storage is above average.,The exhaust configuration in the rear of the vehicle gives it a squat appearance. Merely an aesthetic complaint as it doesn't seem to affect the ground clearance.

We discovered both tie rods and ball joints were bad.Estimated repairs were over $1000.Then a ringing noise in the transmission began to get louder. So we decided to trade in.Dealers were not willing to give us a decent trade because the CVT transmission was starting to go bad.Apparently this is a major issue in the Jeeps especially when it reaches around 60,000 miles.Jeep is not willing to warranty this issue.

","I like my Jeep dealer and suggest you go to a dealer versus Tires Plus, Midas, etc.
those sorts of places always seem to find stuff wrong and the dealer confirms the repair is not all that needed.
And when I get quotes the dealer is less.
I think dealers just have more incentive for you to be happy and keep you coming back.
They want you to buy another car.
Wheras the Tires Plus of the world just want to make as much as they can on that one visit.
My advise, if one of those places says you need new shocks, get a second opinion. Yeah there may have been a slight leak but the dealer told me to wait till I noticed it in my ride.
And when I do the dealers quote was half.
","They should do a better job of attaching the windshield molding,
any strong car wash dryer system has blown mine right off.
I did have it all glued down and it has not been a problem since.

It is agile on the highways, gets great mpg, does amazing in snow, sand traction is good too, and it looks great.

On the highway it ""a dream""  I thought that the small engine would sputter, but it's ""smooth as silk"", no hesitation in front of any vehicle!!  Once friends and family see the style and learn about the package they are impressed, and want to drive my "" Flaming Red Beauty""!","Sunroof, sirus radio, navigator, speakers in the rear door, visibility completely around the vehicle.

It is a Jeep so the creature comforts are prioritized a hair lower - fine by me. Love the look, the practicality and the affordabilty. Great size for commuting- rides higher than a sedan and fits in any parking space with ease. This 4 cylinder has plenty of power (see favorite features). I question anyone complaining about the power - this from a man who learned to drive in a '73 Malibu with a 350 V8.  If the long term reliability is any good this will be my best new car purchase ever.","The 4cylinder and CVRT blew me away on trips through the mountains of WV, VA, PA & NC. Never any hesitation or drag, just strong acceleration throughout. Best performance I have had on these roads.

Since purchasing it, I have had it during two ice storms, one in early 2008, and the horrific one here in Kentucky in 2009. And during both storms, there was one constant: this Jeep just can't get stuck! No matter where I was driving, even without being the trail-rated version, it handled everything, including hills that full-sized trucks with off-road packages couldn't even come close to handling. The fuel economy is great, but it's not sluggish. Acceleration is great, and the auto-stick is a lot of fun, and helps with city MPGs. The interior isn't luxurious, but it's a great utility interior.","Cherokee styling, comfortable seats, 4WD mode is amazing, acceleration is great, and the standard stock speakers are quite nice. I manage to get 30MPG highway. The CVT, once used to it, offers so much control to control acceleration.","The armrest really needs improvement, as does the location of the cupholders in relation to the armrest. Also, a full-sized spare would really be nice. It would also be nice to have tow hooks standard. Even a CVT2 (not L) can help pull somebody out."

I really hate the small 13.5 gallon tank for gas, the Honda CRV's tank is 2 gallons bigger! The CVT makes some noise during hard acceleration but overall fairly quiet. The car pulls pretty well around 4K RPMs (torque curve). I don't drive like a grandma which could also point to the less than standard gas mileage. ","Sunroof, Ipod jack, 17"" wheels, boxy design and small size. ","well they fixed the interior on the 09's. I didn't like all of the plastic that scratches really easy.

Have had bmw, benz, jag before so first American vehicle and very surprised and amazed. This Jeep does have some engineering from Benz though which is a bonus! I believe this is the lightest CUV out there and handles beautifully around corners. Salesman said there is not much get up and go from start, only highway speeds was great but I found out both to be great! The lightweight really comes through here and CVT tranny does a great job at keeping shifts very smooth. Dynamics of vehicle is very balanced. Outside size is deceiving to how roomy it is inside.","Height adjustable front YES seats, reclining rear seats, 110 power outlet, CVT transmission, great styling, quiet, comfy ride, quiet engine compared to others, great rear leg room (more than my previous Jag XJ8), best of all - FUN, FUN, FUN TO DRIVE!!!!",up the styling on interior but after all this is a Jeep - rugged looks and inside to match.

They were in the process of buying it back when they went bankrupt. Now i have no jeep and i'm still making payments. Until that point that point it worked great.

I have put 9700 miles on it, probably 70% city driving and 30% towing my fishing boat, a 16-foot boat weighing about 900 lbs. During this time, my grand average MPG has been 28.3. I have only driven out of the city twice without the boat in tow, and both times my MPG has been over 30. My worst tank of gas was in December during near-record snowfall when I was running a lot of third gear, and got 25.9 MPG. There have been no automotive problems with the vehicle. It has good heat and good A/C. The underside of the car looks very good after one winter. ","Very comfortable and solid front seat. Non-tinted glass, good visibility. Good ground clearance.

Outer Banks and drove through the thick sand like spreading butter without taking a pound of pressure out of any tires (It's recommended to lower tire PSI to 20 before attempting to traverse through the thick sandy beaches).  In my opinion all I can say regarding the Jeep Patriot 4X4 off roading capability is that all 4X4's are limited by physics; however, the Pat's 4X4 off roading capability is up to Jeep standards and is limited by the drivers capability/expertise.

You're not going to break any land speed records, but it has enough power loaded down to get over both passes from western Colorado to Denver without being stuck behind the semis. The patriot is a great value for the money especially with all the options and the safety features. The only downfalls have been having to take it in to repair a the left turn signal that stopped canceling itself, as well as it being a little hesitant to engage in reverse while facing downhill. Cons are outweighed by the pros if it lasts.","Favorite features are great gas mileage, folding down seats, sound system, four wheel drive options, safety features ie side curtain airbags, tire pressure monitoring,stability control, position of stick shift, plastic cargo area, back seat space, comfortable seats, removable flashlight, and 110 plg","Improvements should include more cushiony armrests, better cup holder placement, better utilization of up front storage space, sturdier cargo floor, more insulated cabin if it doesn't add too much to cost and weight ratio for gas mileage, back window that flips open, and another power plug in."

The Equinox was a little too large for my needs, and the Caliber was a little too small, but the Patriot is just right!

5,Why Buy A Small Compact?,Ted ,07/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Here are the facts. I am a Jeep Patriot owner. I do not represent Chrysler or any other car company. I am a retired independent sales rep. I have owned this Patriot for two months. I bought the Sport 5-speed manual transmission. MSRP 18,800, purchase price 15,300. This is by far the best vehicle for the money anywhere on the planet. I consistently get 31.5 MPG on the highway and 26 MPG city and all around driving. It has plenty of power, plenty of comfort and the E-package gives plenty of options for an unbelievable price of 2,200 bucks. I can't believe Jeep and Chrysler aren't pushing this car more than they are. Beats any other SUV or import compact by a long shot.","MPG is absolutely what they say it is, and better. I'm 6'1"" and there is more than ample room to drive or ride. Performance is amazing for a 4-cyl engine and the car is rock solid like a Jeep should be.",Perhaps a little fancier exterior trim on the Sport. 
4.875,Jeep Patriot for a Patriotic American,zulu45 ,07/01/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this to replace a Ford F150, and have NOT been disappointed. I average about 27 mpg with mixed driving out in the country. The acceleration is great, although not really outstanding, it is much more than I need. Overtaking is easy with the Patriot going from 45 to 75+ in almost a blink of an eye. The CVT really does a great job of giving the power when it's needed. And though I don't have the Trail-Rated version, even during a major ice storm this past Winter, the Jeep handled inclines and roads that even pickups with off-road packages couldn't handle. It's nimble, and very comfortable.","My favorite features are the 4wd capabilities, how it handles when driving, it's off-road capabilities, and definitely the fuel economy. In these times, driving the Jeep Patriot seems like the patriotic thing to do, to reduce fuel consumption.","While I like the pure-utility design of the interior, I don't care for how the center console slides forward to have an armrest. I also would prefer that the cup holder and the shift knob have switched places."
5,Realistically the BEST SUV out there,patrioticNORTH ,07/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"'08 North Edition 4x4  It's fuel economical, you get $1000 back from the Canadian gov't under the ecoAUTO Rebate Program for 2007-2008 models (4x2 or 4x4 5spd only)... pretty much the only non-hybrid 4x4 SUV eligible under that program (along with the Compass).  It looks rugged and it's sharp.  It was not love at first sight for me at all, until I decided to buy it because of the great deals that I couldn't resist. I've always been a fullsize type of guy - was looking at a Dodge Ram 4x4.   It's still too new for the engine to break in to get the best fuel mileage and to see it's true reliability down the road.  But so far, I could not be happier with this Jeep -  and I am in love with it.  ",The whole thing... you just can't beat it with its price and its available options.  Just wish there was a Trail Rated 5 spd out there.

I researched buying a car for about 8 months, reading all the reviews, going on test drives, etc. Nothing else could compare to the low cost and great gas mileage: 24 mpg combined average fuel economy in a 4x4 at under 17K. You can't beat that anywhere.   Overall, the Patriot is really for people like me who would prefer a no frills, basic car at a great price. If you like more comfort and  amenities and are willing to pay for it, obviously this SUV isn't for you.  ",Great acceleration / handling with the 5 speed.  Pull out rear cargo floor for easy cleaning.  Front passenger fold down seat.  And the number 1 favorite thing: 24 mpg average for a 4x4!!!!!,"Windshield is too far forward. It's awkward, difficult to see traffic lights above.  More cargo space is needed.  Move some of the lights/ wiper controls onto the dashboard. Everything is put on the levers behind the wheel.

I drive 120 miles a day to and from work, all highway. My average MPG is 23, not the 27 or better. The armrest that the driver and passenger are to share could be larger. Overall, I like my Patriot. It reminds me of the Cherokee, just smaller. I will add my children ages 6 and 9 commonly refer to our new car as a ""box on wheels"".  Unfortunately it's too early to tell what problems will be in our future.

Service said it did not do this for them but other buyers had experienced the problem on a national level. One month later the sound got louder, including a vibration on the floorboard. We are waiting to hear what can be done. We loved the car at first but we never got the good gas mileage and believe it has something to do with that intermittent sound. It happens in all types of driving situations, stepping on the gas, breaking, turning. You might drive a few miles before hearing it or just out the driveway. We wonder if anyone else has had this happen? ",We are so disappointed it is hard to think of a favorite feature. We have owned plenty of Jeeps and this is the first one with a problem but all have been gas hogs.,We believe there will be a recall for this binding sound. We think the car was pushed out with lax quality control because it offered higher gas mileage.

My Patriot comes with 158 HP and I can't wait to add an intake and performance chip. It handles well and surprisingly superior on curves. I'm an SUV person and all the previous SUVs I've had have been gas consuming and poor handlers. The Jeep Patriot is stable enough with a wonderful ground clearance.

I plan to take it up to Michigan over July fourth weekend. I have the base model with the smaller engine. The Patriot is not fast, but handles nicely after about 20 mph. It is slow to start off the line. The CVT is neat, different is good. The engine does produce an incredible amount of noise, but only when driving aggressively. I can cruise in complete silence at 75 mph, but then the tires from the factory start screaming. I've read that changing tires can eliminate the noise. This is my second new vehicle, and third vehicle over all and it's the best.","I like that the vinyl seats look like leather.

Set the cruise at 75 mph, the CVT was smooth and able to maintain 70 mph.  My old 4.0 Cherokee had trouble maintaining 70 up this hill so I am now a believer in the CVT.

So, I figured I would see if there was a ""steal"" out there in the mass exodus/hype to leave SUVs. And, I found one.  I got my Patriot (a complete base model that now in 2008 at least has AC standard) for $12,400 after rebates, incentives and military discount.  Just drove it 220 miles across parts of Carolina and got 33 MPG highway going 65 mph. It's manual transmission, which is fine with me. Windows, locks are manual -- again, OK with me.  The best thing is the larger engine (4.2) gets better MPG with manual transmission  The only complaint is that options add up FAST, which is why I kept it basic.","Styling is classic old-school Jeep Cherokee. The size overall is perfect --  not too big or too small. It doesn't look wimpy like the Compass or, ahem, ""metrosexual"" as the Liberty is (not that there's anything wrong with that).

Also use of a timing belt rather than a timing chain like Suzuki is an expense at 60,000 miles that could cost $$$.

4.875,Jeep Fundamentals,Ryan ,05/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Having traded a supercharged Grand Prix for a 4 cyl. 1.5 ton vehicle, I was a little weary about losing the performance I enjoyed.  I was shocked with the performance of the Jeep and bought the vehicle after further review of reliability and economy.  It won't be setting any land speed records; however, buying a 4X4 setting speed records should be of least concern.  The Patriot has 600 miles now and averages 24-26 mpg including 4X4 use from a recent snow.  All controls are easily located and the steering wheel controls are very handy since my GP had a similar set up.  The Patriot handles like a car, but strong winds can push the Jeep.  Chose the Patriot for the traditional Jeep look. A+ Jeep","Steering wheel controls, 4X4 lock, Sat radio, 9 Speaker Boston Stereo, Reclining rear seats, built in/rechargeable flashlight, autostick transmission, CVT... just a beginning of a long list of great features on the Patriot.","Locking glove box, Premium 6 disc stereo does not have an aux jack, remote start, 17"" wheels fill up with snow easily and cause wheels to off balance making for a miserable ride.  Cleaning snow out of wheels brings back the excellent ride of the Patriot.  Not many complaints. Excellent buy."
5,Surprising Value,msrngtp2002 ,05/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality, comfort and performance of this vehicle.  Mileage in town is about 23.5 mpg and highway hovers around 29.5.  In full automatic mode the car accelerates at a moderate pace, but using the auto-stick really kicks it in gear. Adequate in-car capacity (although I would recommend covering the seat backs if you haul anything that may snag them).  Seat comfort and adjustability offer enough range for just about anyone.

They are draining tank & I hope to be going soon. However, I remain concerned.    ",,
4.5,Almost perfect,Jim ,05/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,2,4,5,"If the front seats were built better, this would be the perfect vehicle.  It is the perfect size, gets about 25 mpg which is good for a 4wd, has great visibility, and well designed flexibility in loading the interior.  It is a real blast to drive, and getting used to the CVT transmission didn't take as long as I expected.  So far, I have not discovered any factory defects and this Jeep really seems tight - no squeaks or rattles.  This is built much better than other Chrysler products that I have owned.  However, the front seats are thinly padded over a hard shell.  There are no springs and, consequently, no give in the seats.  Bumps telescope directly to your spine through your tail bone.

The heated leather seats, moon roof, and standard Sirius Radio on the Limited Edition, it was love at first test drive!

Good driving position, handles better than entry-level sedan. Easily holds surfboard/dog.  Negatives: Crappy Chrysler paint job, lots of orange peel. Weirdly -- can anyone explain this? -- when mine hits 68mph the engine emits a high-pitched frequency sound. Not good ... Engine noise is moderate apart from that. I got mine with 0 miles on clock.  Would recommend it to anyone. Love its looks in bad-boy black, I shoulda got the 17"" rims tho ...","MP3 input, removable hose-able cargo floor. Quality of seat materials.

The engine is still breaking in,getting 22 to 23 mpg mostly around town  If you don't need a rock crawler or a super sized suv,and you'd rather put your hard earned money in the bank rather than your tank, this is your vehicle.With gas approaching $4/gallon, I applaud Jeep for thinking ahead.","Both awd and 4wd, CVT works beautifully, autostick is nice so you don't have to ride brakes downhill or twisty roads.

You feel like you are in a bigger SUV, but its really compact and easy to handle. Not to mention that fuel efficiency is good.  Just one advice, make sure you get the 5-speed manual transmission. I test drove both the automatic and the manual. The automatic version its a hog!  Just what you would expect from a 2.4, 4 cyl- automatic tran combination.  The manual 5-speed tran. its just perfect! Fast pick up speed and much more fun to drive!  Plenty of room for the GF, fishing rods, ice chest and the dog!  This SUV is great for 14.4K including tax and title. Can't beat it!

Wanted another Cherokee, but with better mileage. After reading about everyone's complaints regarding power, I test drove a 5-speed manual Patriot. It seems whatever issues people have with lack of acceleration can be blamed on the CV-tranny, not the engine. ""But how can I talk on the phone and sip my latte and drive a manual transmission?"" You can't. Go buy a Kia. After two months, I am extremely pleased with this car. One of my initial reservations about buying it (it had everything I was looking for for less $) was that I wasn't seeing any on the roads.

4.875,Patriot a pleasant surprise!,Larry from Michigan ,04/02/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Have had the Patriot for two weeks now, and I am so far very pleased with this vehicle.  The five-speed transmission is forgiving and responsive. The ride is quiet (in fact, the first time I came to a stop sign, I thought the engine had killed). The suspension is perfect- firm but not brittle-feeling. Vinyl seats have been nice, firm and comfortable. The vehicle rolls very freely in neutral, and the resultant glide is nice if you like to coast in to stop signs for better gas mileage. My first tank of gas gave me 33 mpg in mixed suburban driving, no freeway. There is good visibility around the car.  I love driving it.","Good gas mileage, high ground clearance, quiet engine, solid feel, rugged good looks. ",Larger gas tank. Maybe squeeze another inch or so of space between the wheel wells in cargo area. Sun visor doesn't extend out far enough to cover driver's side window.

5,A Move Up As Far As I AM Concerned,GHW ,03/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I guess the performance is in the mind of the user.  I have owned a Cherokee Sport, a Grand Cherokee Laredo and a Liberty.  For value per dollar spent, I'll take the Patriot hands down.  I have the 4WD with the CVT and I don't experience the ""Performance-robbing"" attributes that are described by the reviewer.  If jumping on it to merge is your goal, you may want to think about souping up a Neon or Eclipse.  I didn't buy any of my Jeeps for their ability to go 0 - 60, that's absurd.  I drive them because they are sound and safe vehicles.  The ride in my Patriot is smooth as silk and surprisingly quiet.  I don't have any problems getting to 70 mph or maintaining it.

I feel larger than it really is, as I look over the long hood.  The handling is also great this thing turns on a dime!

Great interior room, and lots of headroom too.  You can sit real adults in the backseat, great Jeep looks, and all while getting great gas mileage.  We got some bells and whistles in ours and still got it out the door for 15600, don't know how jeep is selling these so cheap.  Don't listen to complaints about cheap interior quality, Jeep made it that way so it's easy to clean, it's all wipe off surfaces, cargo area too.  Congrats to Jeep, they did a great job on this.","Lifetime engine, great headroom, good on gas, fold-flat seats - you can fit 8 ft 2x4's in this thing!","Rear liftgate seems designed to bang your head on when loading/unloading, roof racks only go along the roof sides, need cross racks too.

I have not heard the so called screaming red line engine noise to get up to speed on the highway, in fact I feel a better performance than my Toyota did.  Yes it has the Jeep look and interior, but really not that bad at all. It does feel safe on the road with a good view of what is around you, a problem I had with the Toyota blind spots to the side rear. All in all, I am glad I made the change.","Love the view you get, and the simple interior design makes it easy to use the controls. Plenty of space for your needs, being the owner of 5 dogs in the 80 pound range I find it easy to take 2-3 at a time out to the beach."," Only fault I see is they could put a bit more work on the interior.

Friends of his thought the seats were leather (they're vinyl), the ride is smooth, and he gets 28-29K on the highway.  He still has the outside temp guage, low tire pressure sensor, and Lifetime Powertrain warrentee","Manual transmission, outside temp guage, vinyl, easy to clean seats, milage, lifetime powertrain warrentee, comfortable ride, nice stock radio.",Make the removable flashlight in the back standard-it really comes in handy. It's really a great value for the money-and you get 4WD!
5,Neat Jeep,VOR ,12/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought this after checking out the Escape and Outback. The Patriot is a much better value and a much better off road and winter vehicle. I special ordered the Sport 4x4 with a manual shift and have been driving in snow pretty much since I got it. The combination of 4WD, stick-shift, and anti-skid mechanism is great - especially for the price I paid. It also has a quiet smooth ride with comfortable front seats. The reason I sold my truck for it though was because I needed better gas mileage. It's great.","I really think this is the best value in a smaller 4x4. It shifts very smoothly, rides great and holds the road in all kinds of weather. I also like the fact that it gets about the best safety ratings in its class. ",The Sport model (which looks better in my opinion) should come with fog lights and the option of the blue tooth system as does the Limited model.
5,Very Impressive SUV,teebyrd86 ,12/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded in my 05' Toyota Corolla S for my new '08 Patriot with upgraded rims, tinted windows, keyless ect. (everything the limited has but those cheap looking leather seats!) I do miss things about my Toyota but the Patriot suites me a lot more. It has plenty of room for my frame (6'4) and it very comfortable. The best thing about my Patriot was the price. I totally recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a nice SUV at a great price. Going from a Toyota to a Jeep is a big difference but I am glad I made the transition back to Jeep (my first car was a Wrangler!) You definitely get more for money with Jeep.",Style and comfort at a great price! Great MPG!,A little bit more fit and finish on the interior. With out a doubt my Toyota Corolla's fit and finish made the car feel more expensive. Other than that nothing more to say!
5,Patriot Update Bought a Second one...,NewJeepGirl ,12/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We've had 4 winter storms to date. Last storm dumped 10 inches. Drove home with no problems-slight slip in the intersections, but even our 97 Expedition slipped in that too.  Very capable in the snow! Used 4WD lock to get in the driveway-works great! My husband loves mine so much, we just got him one yesterday-stripper for $17K-how can you beat that for the milage and 4WD? Even the vinyl seats don't feel cheap-looks like leather. Still has side impact airbags, ABS, electronic stablility control, tire pressure alarm light and outside temp guage.  A lot of bang for the buck- plus it's a nice Marine blue-very sharp! Looking forward to better milage. Trading 96 RAV 4 that's only getting 20MPG.","Lots of bang for the buck-unlimited powertrain warrentee. Nice seats, easy clean up. Roominess made us choose this over a Compass-better headroom and far larger trunk space. Ease of getting in and out of. Our second Patriot-just got mine last month. Great ride, smooth manual tranny (such a plus!) ","Rear floor mats that stay in place- they need anchors or something. My kids easily slip the all weather floor mats out of place. I think it's great that Jeep gives people the option of getting a manual tranny truck with nice options, not like other companies that shove you into an auto transmission."
5,Go Patriot!,urban dog ,12/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was looking to replace my 2003 Toyota Matrix XRS and I happened upon the Patriot reviews on this site. I checked out the specs, ratings, and comparisons and really liked what i saw. I jumped on to the Jeep site, built my own, and submitted my request. Next day, a nice lady from the dealer called me and to make a long story short, I'm a proud owner of an 08 Patriot sport 5sp 2x4. (w/ a few bells and whistles) What can I say..Good looking retro Cherokee looks, nice ride, peppy 4 banger w/ good mileage, roomy, great safety features, auxilary jack on the radio is awsome, and the insurance was cheaper than the Matrix. The Patriot is not God's gift to man, but it sure make me happy.","Looks, value, quality, standard safety features, fun to drive.","Drivers side dash storage compartment, daytime driving lights, the storage compartment under the radio needs a ledge or grip liner to hold your stuff in place when you step on the gas, full size spare on tailgate to get extra storage space, removable cup holders so can wash out the spilled crud..."
4.75,I like it,Mike Lowery ,12/10/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I'm in the military and bought this through the on post car sales and I've only been driving it about a month and some change. But so far I really enjoy the vehicle like said earlier dosen't have a lot of off the line power but it has more HP than the average 4 banger, especially considering the last 4 banger I drove was in 94. Anyway all around I personally think its a great deal and the test drive is what took me to this over the Dodge Nitro. Not as flashy but rides smoother and dosen't have a huge parking brake right beside your thigh, that's just my opinion though go test drive it yourself see how you like it versus these reviews","Good mileage, able to transit friends comfortably, decent radio and speakers surprised me especially for a stock system","A little more cargo room, brakes on the test drive model made a funny clink noise but mine dosent not sure if its the vehicle or just that specific one, a larger gas tank maybe?"
5,Very Happy So Far,NewJeepGirl ,12/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded in my 05 Xterra for this Patriot. Wanted better gas mileage and better quality-Xterra leaked oil at 23K and ABS computer quit at 400miles. Just had our first snow fall-Patriot is sure footed and secure. Like the 5 star crash rating and side curtain airbags. 5spd manual shifts very smoothly. My family can get in and out of the car much easier than the X. I like driving it much more than I anticipated. Get a lot of bang for the buck-Lifetime powertrain warrenty, plus moonroof, outside thermometer, power windows, ABS, Stability control,etc. Glad Jeep still makes 5spd tranny's.  Milage 22 city 28 hwy plus roomy trunk & legroom made me choose this over Suzuki SX4.  Like it more every day","5 spd tranny, moonroof, outside temp guage, lifetime powertrain warrentee, available accessories galore, nicely laid out interior.  Very capable in the snow, side impact airbags, 5 star crash test rating, ease of entering/exiting the vehicle, roomy solid feel. Comfortable, capable feeling vehicle.",Can't think of any right now.  I'll write back later for a follow up review.
5,Really Impressed with this New Jeep,NewJeepGirl ,12/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just purchased a Patriot-traded my 05 Xterra after it started leaking oil at 23K. Really like the Patriot-great combo of family utility, 4WD, and roominess for a reasonable price.  Impressed with the sticker gas mileage. Was able to get a moonroof, outside temp guage and tire pressure monitor for under 21K. I'm really glad Jeep still offers a 5 speed. So tired of getting auto trannys crammed down my throat! Jeep offers a lot of bang for the buck-for those who want a roomy family friendly 4WD, take one for a test drive-you'll be suprised! I couldn't believe all of the features it has for the money. Can't beat the lifetime powertrain warrenttee. Extending the bumper 2 bumper isn't 2 expensive","Manual tranny, outside temp thermometer, moonroof, nice stock radio, ease of entry into the vehicle, roomy cabin, great all around vehicle- lifetime powertrain warrenttee, and a bumper to bumper warrentee upgrade that doesn't break the bank. Looking forward to the promised gas mileage- only have 170mi.","6 speed manual tranny, black paint on doors like the compass to resist fingerprints/scratches, body molding on outside of doors to resist dents from other cars. Utlity bin for space around spare tire for storage. "
4.875,Let me just tell you...,SJZ123 ,11/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Traded in a 2000 Cherokee Sport for an '08 Patriot, was unsure if I wanted to but after test driving it a few times I had to have one. The MPG is great usually runs me about $28-$33 to fill up (lot better then my gas chugging Cherokee which averaged about $50+ a fill up. The Patriot is comfortable, fun to drive, very roomy, feels like a cross between the Cherokee and the Commander. The CVT You have to wait about 1,500 miles for the electronic transmission to dial in to get the correct gear ratios but once it does the performance picks up.  I've had mine for about 2 months now and have racked up about 3,500 miles already. ","17 inch rims, reclining rear seat, 115 volt electrical outlet, front and side airbags, pretty decent factory stereo.","New placement for the front dome lights and sunroof buttons.  It has more horse power then your average 4 cylinder, I would suggest a little better power transfer setup so you can get it moving faster off the line.  Other then those two things I have no complaints about it."
4.875,Bargain 4x4,Dan ,10/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"This is the cheapest 4x4 suv you can find. I got 24 mpg on the first tank. Lots of options and it still was cheap. I can't see myself in a RAV4 or CRV, but this one feels like a real truck. ","4x4. MPG. Satellite radio and ipod hookups. Heated seats are nice. Looks cool, like a mini Cherokee.",None yet.
4.875,1st Jeep and Loving It,1st Jeep & Love It ,10/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Loving this Jeep. Hard to find the negatives about it. For those who want more power and complain that it's whimpy, go buy something bigger.  It's that simple.  But if you are looking for a smaller cheaper SUV and want to park in more places than bigger SUVs, then get this Jeep!  I recommend this to anyone.  Well, the limited version anyway.","Style is great, interior is good, realibilty is backed up because Jeep is offering a lifetime powertrain waranty. Enough said.",Hybrid version to bump the MPG way up because the tank is a little on the small side.
4.75,What a Jeep,ShadowRider ,10/24/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I bought the Patriot after much research starting at the time of its intro at the Frankfurt auto show.  I have driven Jeeps since '85 and this is the best one yet. I love the handling and spaciousness. The ride is much smoother than many of the midsized and fullsized suvs I have riden in.  The 4WD is easy to use and efficient. Bottom line is that I would recommend this vehicle to any of my friends. I love it, and have no intention of driving anything else, except my motorcycle.  ","Great gas mileage, lifetime bumper to bumper warranty option. Roomy interior, very comfortable ride; excellent vision front and rear; looks, feels, and is sturdy, yet very maneuverable. ",A rear cargo cover to hide packages or equipment and tools. 
4.25,Everything I expected,urbanshag ,10/15/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,We have a 2006 4cy Wrangler and the Patriot feels like a jet in comparison. With the manual transmission I can get the car moving right along. So far the gas mileage is around 27 with the miles being mostly freeway. I am going to put a trailer hitch on it and put it to work so I shall see what it can do then. I love the car. I began to look at them 2 weeks after hitting the dealership with the 2007 model. I finally found a deal (newspaper special on a 2008 for $14888) and I jumped on it. I have the very basic version they make and I seem to be missing nothing. Power this and that is always nice but for me not necessary. ,"mp3 jack, gas mileage, interior space ","Nicer wheels on the base model and wider tires, one more power outlet up front and maybe one in the back"
4.375,Works for us,Randy Fox ,09/27/2007,,,3,5,4,5,,4,5,4,5,"We bought this for the wife so she could have a safer vehicle for our winters. Winter isn't here yet but we sure love how it drives right now!  Nimble steering and great highway ride comfort are 2 big pluses in our book. Gas mileage is about what we expected so we can't complain.  (it's not even broke in yet!) So far, all we can say is: bring on the snow.","Exterior appearance is eye-catching. Tons of room on the interior, even for big and tall guys. The CVT seems to flow smooth as glass with no notable lag on the highway.",Slightly bland interior treatments. Could use a little more styling. Rear cargo door needs to extend up higher than it presently does. A 6-ft tall person can hit their head on this if they are not careful. 
4.5,Sport stick a must,intrade ,09/13/2007,,,4,5,4,4,,5,4,5,5,"Had the 2.0 with CVT and sport stick now for two weeks averaging over 26 mpg, trying. Sport stick is great and makes this a fun driving commuter that I'm not ashamed to be seen in.","Sport stick, Jeep styling",Better interior plastics
5,I love it,starz ,09/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I originally ordered a 2007, but due to backlog at the factory, I was bumped to a 2008.  I currently have 1200 miles in and I am getting 33.6mpg in a good mix of city and rural driving. I'm very happy about that. I am also impressed by the spunk it has with the 2.4L VVT engine. More than enough for me. It rides extremely smooth and quiet and handles well. Interior is well put together although somewhat outdated in style. I have the manual 5spd and it is probably the smoothest shift I have ever experienced.  I also love the idea of the lifetime powertrane warranty. I keep vehicles for at least 10 years.","Manual transmission, ESP, ABS, side airbags, side curtain airbags and 4 and 5 start crash ratings.  The cruise control is really easy to use as well. I wasn't thrilled with the YES upholstry to begin with, but it has grown on me and I am starting to appreciate it now.  I also prefer its firm seats.",I would like to see a 6spd manual and I would have purchased the CRD version in a heartbeat if it was available in the US.  So far only in Europe.
4.75,Jeep Got it Right,New Patriot Owner ,09/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I've always been loyal to Jeep and have owned two Wranglers, so when I say the Patriot feels like a luxury SUV keep in mind I don't have much to compare it to. But after just a few days zipping around in this wonderful SUV, I can't believe that some owners are giving it only so-so reviews. I bought the Limited Patriot because I was looking for several things:  4-cylinder, comfortable ride with lots of cool stuff (leather, sunroof, heated seats) and of course it has to be a ""real"" Jeep.  Give the folks at Jeep credit - if they didn't create the Patriot they would have lost me as a long-time customer.  I was looking at other small, gas-sipping SUV's like the RAV 4 and the CRV.  Not now!","Huge interior. Feels and looks bigger than it is. Quiet ride, lots of cool features and great MPG. I actually smile when I fill up now. It won't win any drag races but the CVT engine isn't that bad. Still shaking my head that I got such a complete SUV for around 25k. Exterior's all Jeep!","Perhaps a bigger cargo area.  It would be nice to carry four golfers and four sets of golf clubs but that would cut into the spacious seating areas.  Other than that, no complaints yet.  I hope it will be just as durable and dependable as my other Jeeps.  Props to Jeep for some radical thinking!    "
