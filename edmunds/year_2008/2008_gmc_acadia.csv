1,Best terrible car ive ever owned,Aaron Barkus ,10/15/2016,1,2,2,,,1,3,1,3,,,"Living in minnesota roads are potholed, snow covered and salt abused. It is fantastic at cushioning out bumps and drowning out road noise but that os where the praise stops.       One massive problem is MPG the car computer says i average 19 in mostly hyway driving, ive done the math countless times and found it actually get between 13 and 16. The interior seats cause back pain and visibility out the back windows includes the sky and tops of trees. In the winter this car on winter tires with awd has proven itself less snow worthy then my son's fwd volvo sedan on all seasons, thats mostly because in order for the awd to actually kick in you need to floor it. We baught this car new in 2008 and it now has 121,000 miles on it and weve gone through 6 transmissions 2 computers 1 gage cluster, 2 radios, both seat motors, and 2 sets of rims because theyve shattered, weve talked to gm about the constant issues and they claimed normal wear and tear. Idk about you but i find 2 transmitions before 60k miles a problem. The next time something on this car dies its gone and im buying a new volvo!",,
3,2008 GMC Acadia Not Worth Your Money,Amy Buitendyk ,10/07/2016,1,2,2,,,1,1,1,4,,,"We purchased a used 2008 GMC Acadia back in 2011. It had less than 50,000 miles on it and we were very happy with the purchase, at first. Within a month we had our first recall; it was the headlight wire harness that needed to be replaced. Took it in as soon as possible and they replaced it.Next thing we got was a recall on the water pump; that we had just replaced. Since we didn't used an actual dealership to replace it we were out the money we paid for replacing that.Next we got the airbag recall. We have yet to be able to get in to get that taken care of.These are the things we have had issues with:1. Our passenger side window stopped working. I can not get it to go up or down from either the drivers or passengers controls.2. The stabilitrak warning and clicking goes on and off. I take it in to get it looked at and no one can figure out what is going on. When the warning comes on though my car speeds won't go over 25 MPH. 3. Even with the headlight wires replaced since last October (2015) we are replacing our headlights at least 1 time a month. I can't afford to replace my headlights 1 plus times a month. First of all it is difficult to get the bulb in and positioned correctly and they are also not cheap!4. We are having issues maintaining oil pressure. No one can figure out what is wrong there. I will get a warning when I go around corners that says, ""Engine oil low. Stop engine immediately"" and yet no one can figure out what is going on there.5. Two days after we purchased the car there started to be a whining noise when you turn the steering wheel. No one can figure out what is causing that issue either.6. Filling up with gas and the car won't start up then. Thankfully this isn't an every time thing for us.We are still making a car payment on this vehicle. We have had to replace a lot of other things. I can't afford to have a car payment of over $400 and also have to put $500 plus dollars into it on a regular basis. When I started to do more in depth research I am finding that most other owners are having the same types of issues. Struts going out when they shouldn't be. Stabilitrak going off and on. There are so many things and no one can answer me as to what is going on. I am told often this is just normal wear and tear on a vehicle and I should expect thing to go wrong.Yes things can and do go wrong on vehicles but I have never in my life had a vehicle that has had this many problems. They all happen well before they should.",,

Overall price of work done to this car ranged well over $12,000.00 in the past 3 years. It has been one issue after another, too many to list. Several technicians at the dealerships that this vehicle has ben to have told me to get rid of it ASAP. 2008 Acadias are known for being a pile of junk with one issue after another.

2,Last GM product I will ever own.,Jesse Daniels ,11/03/2015,1,4,4,,,1,4,2,4,,,"GM discovered that many Acadias recieved a defective wave plate during assembly.  The wave plate is a component in the transmission.  Instead of recalling the Acadia and having the part replaced, GMC offered a special warranty up to 120,000 miles to reimburse the cost of transmission repairs.  Of course, since I actually take care of my car and drive it gently, my wave plate lasted until 121,500 miles.  The transmission repair cost $2700.  The problem was a defective waveplate.  GMC did not provide any assistance with the repair costs despite the fact it was barely beyond the warranty.  I'm actually somewhat thankful though.  Now I have a good excuse to buy a foreign car.  For the past 20 years, I have always owned domestic vehicles...mostly GM vehicles because I have felt proud of supporting the domestic auto makers.  But, with this latest issue, it is apparent that GM has no interest in supporting their customers.  Now, if people give me a hard time about buying foreign, I can refer to this experience and people will understand.  This will be the last GM product I own.  I was going to buy a new Yukon in the Spring.  That won't be happening now.",,
1,STAY AWAY FROM GMC ACADIA!!!!,Erin Amerson ,08/22/2015,,1,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,"This car has been nothing but headaches since we've owned it. I bought my 2008 GMC Acadia from a GM dealership as a used vehicle with 50,000 miles on it. Less than one year later all hell breaks loose. During a rain storm while driving, water started pouring into the interior through the seatbelts, airbags and sunroof. The next morning, all of the computers in the car went crazy and the car wouldn't turn on. Had it towed to the dealership, and come to find out there is a water leak issue due to faulty drain tubes in the sunroof. Although a recall for some vehicles, my vehicle's VIN was not included in that recall, even though it was the SAME PROBLEM. Called GM, that was a joke. They said there was nothing they could do and basically that it wasn't their problem. $1500 later and the leaks are supposedly fixed and so I drive away with my smelly car. A few months later, the engine started running hot. Brought the car back to the dealership and apparently there was an issue with the transmission. Another $500 dropped. The mechanic also informed us of a leak into the master cylinder which he then told us was a common problem he had seen with the Acadia. He said it didn't need to be repaired right at that moment, but would eventually need to be repaired in the near future for a mere $1500. Over the next 2 years in which I owned this car I had nothing but issues. Oil leak (also another common problem with Acadias according to the GM service tech), engine not turning off occasionally even when I took the key out, when I would get gas, I would have to leave the car running because if I turned it off, after I finished pumping the gas it would be very difficult to start the car. Usually took about 4-5 tries. The last and final straw was this past week. I was driving home one afternoon and sure enough, water started pouring into the interior of the car from the headliner. It came in through the airbags, sunroof and top of the windshield. You could also hear the water sloshing around in the headliner as I drove.  I can't afford to keep fixing the same issue that the dealership should take responsibility for in their faulty design on this car.  Traded it in on a Hyundai yesterday and we have so much negative equity in the acadia that my car payment is ridiculously high. Not to mention I have 6 people in our family and so we all do not fit in the car together and will have to drive 2 vehicles whenever we go anywhere as a family. Because we were so upside down trading in the acadia, we couldn't afford to buy an SUV or a minivan. But, at least I know I have a good, reliable car that will not leak that I can feel is safe enough to drive my children in. If you want a vehicle that does more than just look pretty in the driveway then stay away from this one. We will NEVER buy another GM vehicle again. NEVER.",,

Every attempt was made to void any warranty work on my transmission, and the process is still continuing today. Rebuilt transmission has been in for 16 months and is failing again. No assistance from GM. I am being told it is my fault the transmission is going out. I have been a proud GM owner as long as I have had cars, but the service and support from GM has changed that. I will never own another GM product. ",,"Stand behind your work. People work too hard to make the money to buy your cars and when you refuse to offer any assistance, it is just another slap in the face.

(Service traction) for unknown reason. Engine mounts & front suspension can go easily and quickly on slightly rough roads, I heard many complaints from Acadia owners & seen many on the repair shops but when trany started to hunt for gears on cruze control & AC started to consume more power. I gave up and sold it","Third row seats is the best in market, Adult friendly and completely hidden when inclined.. 
Nice ride (When front suspension parts and engine mounts are new)
Good entertainment for the passengers
Nice Look","Never enjoyed the rainy days during my ownership period... How can a 21st century car leak water from the roof??
Engine will not start on inclines! so driver need to take care when and where he should park!

Acadia feels poor when you shut any door, like 70s cars
Steering makes grinding noise, no matter how many times the dealer claims he fixed it
AC comp puts too much load on the engine, you feel you are getting a little power when you turn AC on

Additionally, the driver side window will intermittently just stop working for periods of time. Unfortunately, the window never seems to act up when I take it to the dealership.

While we thought we could downsize with two kids out of the house, we found we still need space in a vehicle for when everyone is home, moving into and out of dorm rooms, hauling around friends, etc. This SUV is the perfect size for that...not too big, but with room enough to comfortably seat 6 of us and the dog. I shopped around a lot! Looked at MDX, Volvo, VW, Mercury. The GMC was the best price of all other models I compared to. I love the ease of use of all the controls, visibility is great as well. Not a luxury interior, but practical and well designed. Love it.","Head up display, power liftgate, dual sunroof, remote start.",Can't think of any.

The driver's seat broke the 1st week, the wipers broke mid rain storm, the service airbag light, engine light, and oil light have all been on and had to be serviced.  And there was a recall that had to be fixed!  After all of this I finally get my vehicle back and hit a deer, which did $5500 worth of damage to the front end yet the air bag never went off and on-star never came on! The way it shifts is awful, the noise & vibrations when the windows are down is horrible and I am so sick of this vehicle. Now my tire pressure light is on- it is always something!","I love the asthetics, it's a beautiful vehicle.",Build with more quality!
4.75,Better vs Pilot or Highlander,JONATAN ,11/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I had Pilot and Highlander, but when I bought Acadia I sold Highlander.

But there still some small thing I wan to comment on. For a 40k car there is so much plastic inside. You expect it to be more luxurious but it's not. Have bluetooth, for God's sake we are in the 21 century. Premium sound system is so not premium, bearly giving sound. Guess they forgot to install the amp. The gas mileage is not so bad as long as you are babysitting it, but if you dare to push that pedal you will truly see the gas gauge is going down in front of your eyes, but that should be expected with a huge car like this. After all I still love this car","Remote starter, back up camera, nav, DVD, auto-manual transmission. The look.",Better mileage (I don't think thats possible unless they go hybrid).

The traction control quit working and had to be fixed, then the cruise control quit working, then the battery went dead again while driving at night so we had no dash lights and not much of anything was working, so after 5 times of being in the shop lets hope it's all fixed, we should have a new car by now with all those new parts,oh wait, we did buy a new car.

The review is based on the maxed out SLT2 AWD (w/Nav & DVD). Overall the car is great. Nice ride, great seating, and seems sure footed on the road. Two complaints:  Fuel economy - Don't believe the hype!  We do City/Hwy driving. Avg mpg is 12 city, 16 hwy.  To me, that's terrible for a V6 and compared to what GMC boasts of 20/22. The other complaint is the nav & backup camera has failed on a few separate occasions.  Went back to the dealer and they will replace it. To sum it up, the Acadia is a nice car, good overall build and quality, layout. But misleading on the gas mileage.  ","Nav, OnStar, DVD, and captains chairs",Fuel economy

My only real concern is that there are multiple blind spots, so I am a little paranoid when backing up, and when changing lanes.  You get used to checking a lot.

As I said, the topline summary is that I love it, but here are some more details about my experience: Very quiet -- probably the quietest car at freeway speeds that I've ever owned. Powerful drivetrain -- for a car of it's size, it really gets up and goes. You have to be careful, because with how quiet and powerful it is, you can be going 80 MPH and it feels like 65. Comfortable -- this is a personal thing, but for me, it works great for long trips. I drove back from Utah in a day, and was comfortable the whole way. Gas mileage -- I get about 16 to 25 MPG depending",Very quiet. Powerful drivetrain (easy to get it up to 80 MPH and think you're going 60). Comfortable -- drove Utah to CA in a day and felt good the whole way. Gas Mileage -- 16 to 25 mpg.  Cargo -- handles 4'x6' sheets of acrylic. OnStar -- does turn-by-turn on the standard radio!,"Rattles -- I have found one or two minor rattles that come and go. Torque Steer -- In the most basic version, the car doesn't have variable assist (or whatever they call it), and there's torque steer if you romp on it."
3.5,Buyer Beware!,TINA ,09/19/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,3,4,1,3,"We recently bought the Acadia because we wanted a car with better gas mileage than our Expedition. Big disappointment.  We are only getting about 12 mpg. Since the sticker advertised 16 city/24 highway, you can imagine my surprise when I only got 12. The car is beautiful in design and interior layout is excellent. But if you're looking for a wonderful car with great gas mileage, buy something else. I will be getting rid of this car as soon as possible. Looks aren't everything and if GMC can't do better than to make a vehicle with such poor gas mileage, they should stop making them. I'll take my Expedition back anyday.","Great exterior appearance, interior is very functional and pretty,  love all the cupholders and plenty of leg room","Gas mileage stinks, chrome on the dash reflects sun into your eyes, front vents don't turn towards you, SLE does not have backup camera.

The Acadia has met many of my needs, but reliability is not one of them. In the 4 months weve had the car its been to the dealership 3 times. They had to replace the right cylinder head because of cam shaft end play. Now, I am uncomfortable driving a car that had to have the engine dropped at 6,000 miles for a major repair. A disappointment on a $39K car. I do agree with many of the reviewers that say there is a lack of power at slow speeds when climbing an incline. However, we were fairly happy with the Acadias performance when towing a U-Haul trailer. ","OnStar, XM, power liftgate, remote start, AWD, tow package, the ability to actually seat 7, the cargo area (I can actually fit my jogging stroller behind the third row), and the fact that the Acadia looks way cooler than a minivan.

It had 9600 miles on it when we bought it and we have put cose to 1000 miles on it in the time we have had it. So far, we feel that this is an awesome vehicle. We have averaged right around 20 mpg in both city and hwy driving, and have experienced none of the transmission problems that so many reviews mention. This vehicle is definately an improvement over the 2002 Ford Windstar it replaces. The only gripe I have is the poor rear visability.

This is our first ""American"" badged vehicle and have to say that we are both impressed. Ours was purchased in Nov 07 and with the exception of a leaky sunroof (fixed under warranty) we have had no problems during its first 7500 miles driven. The May 08 transmission reflash was done two months ago and did wonders for the everyday drivability of the car. ",Ours is a fully loaded SLT2 with the only item not purchased was the engine block heater.

She fell in love with the looks so we never test drove prior to delivery. We are satisfied with the vehicle except for the 6 speed transmission. In moderately hilly driving the transmission changes gears from 3-4-5 constantly. The shifts happen after the vehicle slows down 5- 10 MPH and then the engine speeds up from 1800 RPM's to 3500 RPM's to bring the vehicle back to the speed desired.

4.75,Solid and Reliable,HRC ,08/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"We have owned our Acadia for about 13k miles. We selected it over the Acura MDX primarily due to its 3rd row space. Though we had some trepidation about the alleged poor reliability of American cars, I can say that for equivalent miles, the Acadia has been far more reliable than my 2005 Infiniti G35 or my VW Passat. I have had absolutely no reliability issues with the Acadia, while I can't say the same about the others. I was initially concerned about the fuel economy, and I have found the economy to be a mixed bag: city mileage is poor at about 11-14 mpg, but on the highway it is easy to achieve 24mpg by staying <70mph and using the cruise control. This is surprising for a big vehicle.","In general, this car has many features to be happy about. However, the HUD, XM radio, flexible seating, backup camera (your really need one on the Acadia!), smooth engine, and great climate controls stand out.","Some interior materials feel ""low end"" compared to the Enclave or foreign makes.  Also, the basic ergonomics of the seats are not as good as Ford, Chrysler, or non-US makes (I have never found GM seats to be supremely comfortable).

Made the purchase 6 months ago and it is very aggravating. When the warmer months come around, I roll down my back windows-you can't do this at all in this vehicle!  The vibration is so awful it is like you are directly under a helicopter. Made a complaint to GMC, told it was a design issue. The transmission shifting is more than awful!

Looked at all the SUVs including Acadia's two siblings, the Saturn Outlook and the Buick Enclave but picked the GMC. So far we love it! Great inside and out, and the ride is perfect. Two things stand out. We are only getting 19.8 mpg on the highway which is about 10% less than the 22 mpg advertised, whic is the same as my '94 Explorer was getting. Next, I find that on hills especially it hesitates getting into high gear and I have to push down hard on the gas pedal until it slips into high gear, this is very annoying. ",Love the power lift gate and second row captains chairs. The XM radio is also neat since all the stations come in crystal clear regardless of where you travel. Signed on for another year of XM,Rear backup camera a must and it should come standard. Improve gas mileage. Flip up window on the lift gate should also come standatd.

Thanks GMC for a wonderful ride that turns heads as well as makes us smile. My daughter loves lookingt through the 2nd row sun roof especially at night and watching her long awaited DVD player.

Thanks GMC!,The passanger sunroof as well as the fact that my children can listen to their own radio while my husband I listen to something else. I like the comfortable cabin and silence it provides.

I have compared it with the 2008 MDX and the price was cheaper; I've friends who have traded their Tahoes in for the Acadia. They didn't like the bulkiness.

3,Acadia not for dirt roads,Myrt ,07/29/2008,,,2,4,3,4,,2,4,3,2,"We traded off my 2000 Durango for this '08 Acadia and I am disappointed in that the Acadia leaks in a lot of dirt on our rural roads, mostly around the liftgate. A lot of dirt collects between the two rows of weatherstripping around the 2nd-row doors, also, so much that you sure don't want to lean against that area with clean clothes on. I also do not care for the constant shifting of the transmission. My Durango had a 4.7 and I really miss it.","The air conditioning is very good on even the hottest of days, and the 2nd row passengers have more than enough legroom. Our old Durango was short in these areas.","Put an engine in future models. I have had my last 6-cylinder engine. Also, make OnStar & XM radio an option; we have no use whatsoever for it.

3.5,A Bit Disappointed,Joydan ,07/24/2008,,,3,4,4,3,,2,5,2,5,"We traded in a Honda Pilot for the features offered by the Acadia, the primary one being the dual climate control. The particular model we purchased has basically everything, so we are very pleased with that. However, the engine performance is less than desirable and the constant shifting of the transmission, based on changes in the road, etc., especially with the cruise control on, is very annoying. It's as if the transmission and/or engine can't decide how to power the vehicle down the road. Pushing the accelerator slowly doesn't get you much. The gas mileage is high teens, averaging around 18 - not the greatest. Certainly has all the bells and whistles. A very stylish vehicle.","Dual climate control, the navigation system, backup camera and sensor system, the heads up display and the airplane like cockpit setting of the driver's area, all make this vehicle exciting to drive. Also like the automatic opening/closing rear tailgate and the remote engine start. ",The transmission and engine power issue along with the seemingly erratic shifting problems - need work. Not sure if this is a vehicle defect or just the way it's engineered. Haven't brought this to the dealer's attention yet. I see from other reviews mine is not the only one that acts this way.

It has a nice ride and it's very easy to maneuver, especially for it's size. Very comfortable and huge cargo space with the seats down. We had to find a vehicle that would accommodate three kid's car seats. Being able to walk around the 2nd row seats to access the 3rd row was a huge thing for us (seat won't fold w/ car seat installed). The tranmission is a mess, however! It makes it very difficult to accelerate smoothly to try to save on gas. My MPG avg. is 15.5.

We have the FWD and are only getting 20 MPG and we drive mostly highway so that's a little disappointing. The vehicle is very doggy on hills unless you lay into the gas and then it wants to fly.

Sad to say, my Ford had better gas mileage in town than this Acadia. I only get around 10 miles per gallon in town. I do quite a bit of stop / start traffic, but it shouldn't be this bad.  When I drive, I try to excercize all the gas efficient ways to drive, ie. don't drive with a heavy foot, don't stop quickly say at a light, slow exceleration from a stop, no gunning it up a hill, etc. The transmission is a bit sluggish. It tends to be delayed when trying to go up a hill. I really like the car and it's quite stylish, too! ","Style. Automatic hatch lift, 2nd row bucket seats. Lots of space in the back end!",Gas mileage is really bad. Transmission is sluggish & feels like it's going to give up when taking off from a stop sign/traffic light on an incline.
2.875,Service Stabilitrak/Service Traction ,Stranded by GMC ,07/08/2008,,,3,5,1,1,,3,4,2,4,"I have owned my  2008 Acadia for going on 1 year. Since December 2007 we have had countless problems with the vehicle. the service stabilitrak and service traction control lights come on every 2 weeks or so. It is July now and this morning the light came on and my car shut off on the highway. The dealership never can figure out what is happening with the vehicle.  It has put a ""sour taste"" in our mouths about the GMC brand. I had 3 young children in my car when this happened. It is in the shop again and hopefully it can be remedied.   ",The kids like the radio and rear entertainment (DVD). ,The interior of this vehicle is all plastic. This car was expensive and I would have liked to see better interior quality.  
4.875,Love It!,mswoods ,07/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love the Acadia. I enjoy the drive. The body is bold and stands out. Love all the little extras. DVD, leather seats, and of course the sunroof. The car is an attention getter. It is easy to drive and easy to turn. The rear camera is wonderful when parking. It has enough room on the inside for everyone and you do not feel cramped up. You still feel like you are in a car but you are high like a truck with the room of a SUV! I love it and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun-loving family friendly car that still turns heads! Thumbs up to GMC. Just work on the transmission and auto start! ","Leather seats, seat warmers! DVD. Rear controls so my daughter can listen to her own music! Rear camera, push open gas cover. Controls for the radio/navigation/cruise on the steering wheel. All the cup holders, the extra storage on the dash plugs in rear for pc/mp3. Basically I love it.","The transmission, Not sure if it needed to be a V8 but it seems like the motor struggles or downshifts often. The remote starter should have a longer range. It should also have either bluetooth or MS sync. The SLT2 should come equipped with the step assist bars"
4.75,Love our new Acadia,Jon ,07/07/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,Just bought my wife an Acadia and I have been looking for any excuse to take a ride. We have three kids and mother in law who all fit very comfortably in the car.  It is a smooth and quiet ride and the smart slide seats are easy to maneuver for the kids. The perfect car for large families and long trips.  Love both interior and exterior design. My only complaint is the chrome trim on the interior gives off a high glare in the sun.  ,"XM radio, navigation and OnsSar subscription is awesome. Moonroof and skylight in the back are nice touches",Remove chrome trim in car. 
4.875,The best GMC ever,Ed @ Barrett ,07/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have had GMC products for 30 years and have changed models due only to increasing or decreasing family size. From the GMC conversion van, to the Suburban, to the Yukon, to the Envoy and now to the Acadia.  Without a doubt, this vehicle is the nicest, most well equipped, comfortable that I have owned.","All the little compartments for storing CDs, pens, radios, etc.","When the second row buckets are retracted for storage, they should be able to be locked in place.  Also, would like to see more leather in the driver's area. Seems to be too much plastic there now. There should also be a hanging bar more accessible to the rear hatchback.  "
4.75,Our pick of many,Anne P. McLaughlin ,07/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"At first the vehicle seemed a little big after getting out of our Honda van. It was not long before it was a pleasure to get in and drive away.  Mileage however is not the best brag. Even with gas as high as it is today the Acadia is staying right here at home, mileage or no mileage. We have found it to be an excellent buy.","Room for items purchased etc., and the seating is great.","No need to express this but the mileage could be a little better even if gas prices were below one dollar. But, still this is a great piece of work and good transportation."
4.875,Love It!,Carol ,06/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Picked up our Acadia in February and used it on several long distant trips getting between 22-26 mpg on the highway. My daughter and I (plus 2 young granddaughters) use it for our weekly grocery shopping - doesn't hold as much as her Tahoe but we enjoy the Acadia's large individual comfort zones.  We love XM radio, climate control keeps all areas of the vehicle very comfortable ","We are a tall family, 5'9""-6'4"", no lack of leg room with the Acadia.  Second row seating is very comfortable. Lots of compliments on smooth ride and vehicle style. Automatic rear door is awesome when you are loaded down with groceries.",Engine struggles a bit on Ozark back roads shifting often between 5th and 6th gear. Opening up second row window causes major air pressure thumping.
4.625,Weird Transmission,bkcm251 ,06/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,4,5,"We're very pleased with our new Acadia in all respects except for one - the transmission shifts weird, especially under light acceleration. It seems to shift too early under light acceleration which then has a negative effect on acceleration. The shifts almost seem like it is skipping a gear. RPMs will go from over 3000 down to under 2000 in a single shift resulting in a significant loss in power. It doesn't seem like the transmission utilizes the 270hp fully, typical of a GM product in my experiences. It acts like it has a 100hp engine unless you put your foot on the floor and then it takes off like a spring chicken.  Mileage has been respectable for this size of vehicle, 21.5 hyw.","Telescoping tilt wheel, stereo aux input jack, trip computer, OnStar.","Transmission.  Get mileage to 25+, hybrid?"
4.5,Love it,LewisG ,06/24/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Had our Acadia about three weeks now, and love it.  After having Expeditions and Suburbans it was a shock to go down, but the car is great.  Seats are all very comfortable, and so far the tranny hasn't been an issue for us. Kids love it too. Have to agree with folks on the cupholders and outlet up front. They need at least one more plug or even two on the side of the console so you can plug things in without blocking the front cupholder. Mileage is about what we expected (15 so far with heavy city driving) Great car.",The dual-panel sunroof. Overall styling.,"More power outlets, bigger cupholders."
4.375,Sickening MPG,Matthew ,06/23/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,1,5,"Boght the car with future plans on bigger family. Gas mileage and prices have killed that idea! Average about 12/16 city/highway in Hawaii. Love the truck almost as much as anything I have ever owned and never would think I could find a better designed or planned American built vehicle in this class. It sits in the garage most of the time however due to the very poor mileage but when we do drive it, it is almost as much fun than the actual destination. If you love comfort, space, quality and having people's heads turn this is the vehicle for you. If you hate paying out the yang for gas, don't even entertain it. ","Everything! DVD system a must for children and comes with Bose sound system that makes it fun for the parents. Recommed high end features such as remote-engine start, Nav system after market as they are usually cheaper and better.","GMC, quit bluffing the mileage estimates.

It shifts up or down when it wants to, not when it is suppost to. I love the car but transmission thing is very hard to live with. It gets 20 to 22 mpg, looks great. I went back to dealer, but they said it was ok. I am hoping they will have a recall on it.     ",Looks and remote start.,Transmission shifting

5,Get On Board,Robert ,06/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"By far the best crossover out there. Great handling with the stabilatrac, not like an SUV that can roll over easily. All the controls are very close. Getting 21 mpg, I think that's great for this vechile. If you don't need AWD get the FWD you'll save about 1700 on the price & get 4 mpg more.

At 2100 miles the check engine light came on. They said the gas cap was loose and even though we repeatedly removed the cap and replaced it, the check engine light would not go off. They had to reprogram the computer to get the light to go off.  To compound the misery I'm only getting 17-19 mpg with 90% of my driving being on the turnpike using the cruise control!  They say they can do nothing about the gas mileage but it should get better around the 10,000 mile mark!!",Tight turning radius for a large vehicle.

It has problems going up even the smallest of hills without downshifting. When you are trying to pick up speed and merge into traffic you have hesisation and downshifting. I have had it serviced and it improved the hesitation somewhat but the downshifting leads to the worst driving car I have ever owned.  The gas mileage is also awful. I am only getting 13.9 around town. For a vehicle with a sticker over $40,000 I think GMC should be ashamed of itself!",Interior comfort and design,Get rid of the downshifting issue and improve the gas mileage

4.875,Love it! But look out for insurance rate,Heather ,06/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We've had our Acadia about 9 months and dearly love it. Gas mileage is about the same or slightly better than our supercharged Buick Regal. Love the extra space, Love the extra features, love everything!  I would buy this again, for sure. For convenience, mileage for its size (although they need an E85 or hybrid option), features, pure styling (looks so beautiful!) and performance it gets a gold star. ","Small turning radius, fun to drive, great features, big size, 3rd row, beautiful.","Insurance companies give this a symbol rating of 20, which means your insur rate will be sky high.

3.375,Terrible Mileage,Martin ,06/02/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,3,4,1,3,"Right after purchasing vehicle drove all the way to Cancun, Mexico via Baja California (5,050 miles). Good points: Comfortable ride, lots or room. Two things very bad; First: average mileage was barely 17 miles/gallon. Second: Using cruise control 6th gear only works when highway level. At the slightest incline car shifts into 5th gear hurting overal gas mileage. At altitude (Mexico City) car clearly underpowered.","Second row can be moved to provide more leg room..great feature. Setting up 3rd row seat easy. A/C with outlets for each row, best I have seen in any car",Gas mileage great disapointment. No way to get even close to the 22 miles/gallon highway claimed.

Mine is fully loaded with everything imaginable. Instrumentation is excellent including the heads up display on the windshield. Bose is great as is the 36 ""favorites"" you can set up on the audio. It's nice that you can move from AM to FM to XM without changing the mode. This is my first SUV so I'm just getting used to the size. My last car was a BMW 330 so the change is quite dramatic for me. Backup camera helps tremendously in reverse.","Instrumentation, ride, comfort, NAV, camera and sound features are just top shelf","How can they let anything leave the assembly line without Bluetooth!

The outdoor thermometer can be off by more than five degrees and you have to put the vehicle in ""Park"" to display more than five locations on the navigation system when looking for a gas station or resturant. They tell me engineering is working on the thermometer and remote start and the Nav sytem problem is a safety feature.

I am disappointed in the gas mileage.  I have a noise coming from around the left front tire, it makes a popping sound similiar to perhaps it is misfiring.  The dealership says nope it is the ABS setting. Other than the popping at take off no problems and I hope once it breaks in the fuel economy will get better. I would recommend one to anybody wanting a SUV and room to boot it has it and it does not look like a mini van in the process.  I plan on keeping it for many years.   ","The curb appeal and the most importantly the saftey features. And mine tells me what my cruise control is set on takes the guess work out.  I love the back up sensor that lets me know if I am to close to objects, I usually back in and park when ever possible and it saves me from backing ito things.","Fuel economy. The ABS system should not make that annoying sound at take off you think something is seriously wrong, but apparently not.

3.625,My Acadia Review,Patti ,04/01/2008,,,1,5,4,4,,5,4,2,4,"I enjoy driving the Acadia. My only faults with it is a few design issues with the interior. If you want to charge your phone you can't put anything in one of the cup holders in the front. Very little storage space as far as putting things away so they don't move around vehicle while driving, other than back only storage in between two front seats and dash board. I was shocked there was not in floor storage for headsets. I also has a few blind areas when driving hard to see if other cars are in lane on passenger side, perhaps it would help if you could sit up a little higher in the vehicle. Overall it is a nice car even with these few issues. ",I enjoy all the seats in it. I really love the heated seats.  ,Move the cigarette light plug in or move the cup holders currently you can't use them both at the same time. I would add some type of storage for headsets and remote currently know place to put them. I would also figure out a way to get rid of some of the blind spots ex: looking over left shoulder.
4.5,Outstanding and Refined,desertprince ,03/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"This vehicle is heads and shoulders better than the Yukon it replaced.  Much more sophisticated, beautifully engineered, and a pleasure to drive. I specifically ordered bench seats to increase cargo capacity. It's huge. I've been driving GM vehicles for more than 40 years, and this is by far the best. Vehicle has a solid and steady feel to it. Interior is well laid out although small buttons take getting used to.  ","Smooth and comfortable ride, great handling, all manner of interior creature comforts. Love the satellite radio. Observed mileage around 16 city, 18 mixed, and 21 pure highway.  Not bad for a vehicle this size.  Power is adequate...barely.","Transmission is quirky at best, frequently upshifting and downshiting at unexpected times. The highest gear is very high, which leads to low rpms, low torque, and improved mileage. Should have been corrected for 08 but wasn't. Also I don't need annoying light for passenger air bag on or off."
4.875,Love this truck ,paula ,03/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've had the truck for 3 months and I love it. Very comfortable, very roomy. The gas mileage could be better but not bad compared to other SUV's.  ",,
4.5,Crossover of the Year,dan ,03/23/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I bought my Acadia in January, and I love it. The biggest surprise was the handling. It comes standard with stabilitrac, and you definitely notice how smooth the turns are. It has the room of an SUV but it rides like a Lincoln. If you are afraid to buy an SUV because of gas prices, I'm averaging about 20 mpg city and highway. It only takes $55 to fill up at $3.15 per gallon so it's doesn't hurt too bad. Another great feature is both the 2nd and 3rd row seats fold completely flat giving you massive storage room.  ou can also move the 2nd row bucket seats back for more leg room.    ","Stabilitrac, OnStar, storage space","My biggest complaint is the chromed air vents. When the sun is a certain way, it reflects on the air vents and it hits me in the eye. I wish the gas tank could only be opened from the inside.  "
5,Best Cross-Over Out,Robert ,03/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The new GMC Acadia is absolutely the best new crossover out there right now. Whichever trim level you decide you will not be disappointed. I have been looking to by a new vehicle for 6 months and at first i thought the price range was just too much. But after comparing the features and standards to other similar vehicles i kept coming back to the acadia. I thought about buying the honda pilot, but after test driving them both i purchased the Acadia. No regrets here.","My favorite features on the new GMC Acadia are the dual sunroof, Nav with backup camera, and the power side mirrors.  I never thought I needed these things until I got them, now they are my must have features.",I have heard many people suggest a V8 version would be nice.  I am fine with the standard V6 myself.
4.375,Great vehicle,Acadia Georgia ,03/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,2,5,4,4,"Have owned 3 Yukon XLs, Yukon Denali. Envoy--love this vehicle! More leg room than Envoy, but hate the transmission.  Too much surging, lagging, no pick-up, changes gears too often & at wrong time.  I'm a GM person, but the transmission needs serious improvement--it's my only complaint about the car, but I don't know if I can stand this for 2-3 yrs.","Tons of leg room, easy access to seats, great appearance, fabulous bells and whistles--can't imagine anything else!","Carpet needs to be dark (same color as dash, like my Envoy was), because I've only had my car 6 weeks, don't have small kids,& the carpet is already showing dirt. Why would you make carpet that light?"
4.875,Best Cross-Over Out,Robert ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have been looking at this vehicle for about 6 months, but the price compared to other vehicles always kept me looking for something as good but cheaper. Unfortunatly I never found that vehicle. I ended up purchasing this vehicle because it offered everything and more than any other similar vehicle out there.  All the little things that it has over the competition ends up making this car a value buy from the low end model to the high end.  They really hit the nail on the head with this vehicle.  This is such a quite and comfortable vehicle. It is as roomy and a mini-van but still give you the feel of not driving one. Love it ","My favorite features on my Acadia has to be the dual sun roof, back up camera, and bucket 2nd row seating. If you use the 3rd row seating at all, being able to just walk between the seats is a huge plus.","Wow, I really have a hard time with this one, but some people pass this vehicle up because of the V6 only line up. Only other thing is the carpet in the second row is more generic then custom fit."
4.75,I love this ride,Lordward ,03/09/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I have had my Acadia for only two weeks, but I love everything about this vehicle! I researched many vehicles in this class, but the Acadia surassed all of my expectations! Everything about the Acadia was so well designed. It looks great, the ride is powerful and smooth, and our five children can easily be seated with plenty of room. The V6 engine is very responsive and has plenty of power. I have not expereinced any lag or hesitation. The cruise control function is easily accesible and actually assists in better gas mileage, which for a vehicle of this size, is quite excetional. All conrols are well designed, easliy reached, and the upgraded Bose stereo system is awesome! ","The radio controls on the steering wheel are extremely easy to use. The tri-climate control feature is a must for families! The ease of these controls are easily adjusted by our children, who if you ask them, just love the stereo! I love the exterior design of the Acadia. Very stylish! ",The only suggested improvement would be that the rear lift gate should be a standard power rear lift gate. 
4.875,I Love My Acadia,Laura ,03/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,We purchased our 2008 Acadia last fall after owning a Honda Odyssey for 5 years. This vehicle is wonderful- by far better than the Odyssey! This is the first winter we've had it in Ohio and it handles beautifully through deep snow!  The AWD is excellent. It is comfortable and fun to drive. Outstanding turning radius for this size of vehicle- very easy to maneuver. Lots of interior space and rear seats are easy to fold down.  ,"Fold down rear seats, AWD, amount of interior space, turning radius",Transmission tends to like to shift a lot especially when going up hills.
4.875,Great size & very comfortable,bolina ,03/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"The Acadia is very comfortable and smooth drive. The 7 (or 8) passenger seating is a great option. It feels big but I was quickly able to adapt. The mpg is great for a vehicle of this size.  It is a little sluggish on take off but it is a big, heavy vehicle but it does get decent mpg. I'm very happy with this vehicle and would definitely recommend it.",Heads up display. 7 passengar seating. Split fold down seats for 2nd AND 3rd rows.,Better pick up.
5,Finally a GM worth driving,Eddie K. ,03/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Have been driving Suburbans, Yukons, Jimmy's, Envoys and now the Acadia for over 20 years.  Without a doubt, GM finally got it  right with this Acadia.  Nice and confortable to drive and plenty of gadgets to keep me busy.",Parking assit has saved a few bumps already but the built in XM radio feature is one of my favorites. Rear buckets come in second and slide away buckets for third seat entry is next.,"Love the dash but would like to see more leather on it. Would also like the rear window hatch to open.  Very little to complain out with this vehicle.  The nicest, most stylish GM product I have owned."
3,Not so impressed,Larry Francis ,03/02/2008,,,3,4,2,3,,3,3,3,3,"I find that this vehicle rides ruff and has a lot of road noise. I also find that it has a lot of cheap plastic in the cabin. This is the third GM product I purchased and for the third time I was disappointed, I think I'm going to buy a Ford or Toyota next time.",Size,Use more metal and less plastic.
2.25,2008 Acadia  ,TeagZach ,02/17/2008,,,4,4,1,1,,1,4,2,1,"We purchased a 2008 Acadia on January 31, 2008.  We have had nothing but problems with the front end, brakes, and the engine hesitating.  The vehicle is comfortable overall except for headrests that stick into your head.  The interior is stylish with nice accents and we like the red lights on the interior components. The vehicle handles well.  The 6 speed transmission is less than desirable with consistent lag and hesitations.  The vehicle can't stay at a constant speed as the engine cuts out and when driving and attempting to accelerate the vehicle hesitates.  This is a major safety concern when merging on the highway or trying to accelerate to get out of the way of potential dangers.",The interior is stylish and comfortable with plenty of leg room in any row.  The dash is attractive and stylish.  8 passengers is huge plus for traveling with another family.  The exterior is sleek and stylish with nice accents.  Roof racks are a nice feature.,Without an upgrade the audio system has only 6 speakers which is not enough.  Thee are several tsbs (technical service bulletins) for the front end but still seems to have issues.  If GMC can figure out how to fix the hesitation this would be an awesome vehicle but they don't know how.
4.75,Great ride!,Cahill ,02/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,Much more room than my previous Envoy. Mileage has been tracking at 19.5 for 50/50 city /highway. Right at 22 plus highway only. The 6 speed tranny works smoothly on flat or downhill roads. Uphill it tends to shift up a bit too soon but it just takes a bit to get uesed to it. It's a minor issue considering the mileage performance. Very quiet ride.  ,Backup assist is very helpful with the small rear window. 7 pass seating with easy access to rear seats is pretty slick. Console is well put together. Comfortable seats. ,A few inches of telescope in the steering column would be nice. Openable rear window (hatch) would be a nice feature. OEM accessories are too expensive. $185 for two simple horizontal bars for the roof rack is about twice what it should be. Thye should not be optional in the first place.  
5,Drives like a Dream,Joe ,02/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am very happy with this Arcadia. It has a great ride, nice looks and is fun to drive. It gets decent gas mileage for its size.

4.875,Best I've Ever Owned!,Norman ,02/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I am very pleased with the Acadia.  I have owned two minivans, four japanese imports, and one German, and the Acadia is the best.  I took it on a trip and put 2500 miles on it in one week and rode like a luxury vehicle.  The options are comparable with luxury brands without the cost.  The mileage is respectable, giving me 14.7 per gallon in mostly city driving.  I love the XM and comfort of the seating, as I am 6 feet and over 300 pounds.  ",My favorite features are the remote start and power liftgate.  The fold flat seating provides ample cargo space and the utility I need to move our son's stuff to college.,"A body panel loosened at a carwash, and I had some water get in when parked in my uneven driveway.  The driver's seat could use more cushioning on the sides, and a power button for reclining the seat would be nice."
4.25,Excellent Grocery Getter,TexasLonghornMike ,02/11/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,3,3,"We compared a number of crossovers and set our sights on the Acadia due to the combination of interior size, the availability of captain's in the 2nd row, and its good looks.  To date it has been an excellent grocery getter, capably hauling my wife and two kids from here to there with no issues.  Its good to see GM producing first rate automobiles.","Exterior design, heads up display, dual sun-roof, power rear lift-gate.","Improve the quality of the materials used on the steering wheel (my 2003 Passat would be a good starting place).  Add additional interior storage areas - after all, crossovers are minivans without the sliding doors, so they should have the same innovative storage areas."
5,Updated to new car,Sandra Swan ,02/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I simply cannont tell in words how much fun it is to drive this car. I have been a faithful Chevy Blazer driver since 1995 with the same car! Coming from that car to this car gas wasn't an issue.  I love all the cargo space and easy to use features.  Remote start is a wonderful feature when it is cold outside and your car is warming for you. It is easier to drive in the wind it doesn't blow me around as much. I couldn't think of a better car to come over too if you are a Blazer, Tahoe or other SUV owner without the need for towing.  I highly recommend this car to anyone.",I like the automatic hatch lift.

5,Happy Customer,Ted Hornaday ,02/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Very pleased with our Acadia.  Upgraded from VolvoXC70. Looks great (summit white) and a real pleasure to drive. Bigger, better layout and way more interesting than CX9, Highlander or Pilot.  They really got the suspension right on this vehicle and steering is light and handling is crisp.  Good balance of power, not minivan like and not a big V8 SUV nor does it cost as much as one.  Integrated entertainment package w/wireless headphones sans NAV system is sweet.  Back seat and front seat can finally listen to what they want (XM, MP3, DVD, etc.). Transmission/Power gripes in other reviews are overblown.  Six speeds are going to shift more. Works fine for us.","Entertainment package, 2nd row captains chairs, rear seat access, dual moon roofs, titanium leather, rear power door, good looks in and out. Can load 4x8 sheet goods inside (rear door ajar).","Strange feature sets between models. Picking and getting ""available"" options without getting a loaded SLT2 is confusing.  Just look at the power convenience variations. GM needs to simplify considerably."
4.75,The best SUV,Lovin' the Acadia! ,02/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I bought my Acadia after test driving vehicles for over a year.  I rode in Toyota, Lincoln, Lexus, BMW, Ford, Dodge, Nissan and this was the best ride by far.  The price was reasonable as well.  I put on some highway miles for my job and feel very safe knowing that I have onstar and AWD for these harsh Canadian winters.  I am happy when I drive down the street and see people checking out my SUV.  I get so many comments on it and have already had a few Lexus and BMW drivers interested in switching to the Acadia!","The HUD on the dash is amazing.  It was an option that I didn't really want but came with the vehicle.  I wouldn't change it for one without.  I can monitor my speed at all times and love the way that it tells me temp. outside, speed, what song is playing on the radio etc.",I don't like the gas mileage.  I am also not very happy with the remote starter as you only get to press the button twice and then you have to manually start the car.  It only runs for 10 minutes at a time and has a range of 200 meters!  Not very far!

The MDX's were good vehicles although don't pretend they are problem free (transmissions at 50,000+ miles).  The Acadia fits my needs very well.  In comparison to many vehicles on the road today there is a lot of vehicle here for the money.  My late father-in-law was a career engineer for GM, but this is the first new GM vehicle I've purchased in my life (age 54).

It's truly a vehicle that covers all the bases. Plus a 5yr- 100K warranty and roadside assistance, (some of imports don't even offer roadside unless you purchase it), how could you lose. I give it a big thumbs up. ",The voice recognition system is amazing! Totally revamped from the previous software which wasn't anything to write home about.

The gas milege in the city is really bad. On the highway it's much better. I've only had the truck 2 weeks and wake up every morning questioning the decision. ,Roomy 2nd row and the slide seats to get to the 3rd row are the best. OnStar,Road noise. The position of the navigation system is too low. GMC needs to recall the transmission. 
4.875,Acadia Borders on Excellent,sidewinder ,12/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The '08 Acadia is one solid XUV that met all my expectations and justifies the title, Made in USA (got rid of my German cars that had lots of reliability issues). The pitbull-like stance/exterior, interior design/ergonomics and handling are first-rate and deserve consideration by those looking for pax space and who don't want to drive a van. It feels like one solid block of wood no matter what the road surface is (I opted against the 19-inchers, w/c felt more jiggly and AWD, as my FWD felt quicker during the road test). The engine does have it's work cut out for it when prodded lightly but moves the Acadia with authority when you step on it. Cornering ability is impressive.","Exterior and interior design; hi-tech equipment; captain's chairs; Red- highlighted gauges, command-driving position; pax space; solid, tight feel ","None so far, but will elaborate if necessary."
4.875,Roomy and Fun to Drive ,Amber  ,12/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My Acadia drives wonderfully, better than the other 2 SUVs I have owned. I love the body style the the fule mileage is great for the size of the SUV",I love the adjustable second row of seating. I am tall and it is wonderful to be able to sit in the third row comfortably. I also love that it is so easy to get to the third row. ,
4.875,Great Crossover,ronovia ,12/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Previously owned SUVs are a 1997 Tahoe and a 2000 Mountaineer, and additionally in the past 20 years we have owned vehicles from VW, Ford, Nissan, Volvo, Porche, and BMW. We are very much brand agnostic, so drove every available similar SUV. The Porche wasn't really a consideration, due to price, and wasn't an all around favorite anyway. We really liked Buick's sibling of the Acadia, but the local dealer didn't have one equipped the way we liked. I'd have a hard time rating any car a 10 in more than one or two categories, so I consider 9 excellent. This is an excellent all-around vehicle, but although pleasant to drive, I can't say fun-to- drive. Gas mileage has been in the 20 mpg range. ","The nav system/dvd is fun. I really like the HUD, but would like more information than is available. Rear camera system should be standard on this SUV. OnStar is truly our favorite feature, having been a literal lifesaver in our Sierra Denali, and also with vehicle diagnostics.","Realistically, very little. However, many of the buttons for climate control and the nav/entertainment systems  are small and can be confusing."
4.75,Still getting used to it,BONK ,12/13/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"2000 miles in 6 weeks. Vehicle runs great, and is quick. Reminds me of a Grand AM GT with the space of an SUV. Looking forward to many miles of enjoyment.","7 Passenger 2nd row bucket seats, without the minivan look","More standard features, rather selling them as accessories like luggage rack crossbars and HID Lamps"
4.875,Acadia is more bang for your buck.,Scott G ,12/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Originally wanted a Enclave, but we looked at the Acadia also. What an excellent vehicle. Drives like a dream and handles extremely well. A great vehicle and a great savings over the Enclave.","Roomy interior -- family of 5 (mom,Dad,2 teenage daughters and pre- schooler) is very comfortably seated. We have had 7 in the Acadia and everyone had plenty of room.",Maybe expand the interior selection to include tan.
4.25,Acadia Comments,Larry Johnston ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,3,5,,4,5,3,4,We only have 15000 KM/9000 mi This is a very comfortable vehicle and it handles very well on the road.The AWD is noisy when it engages to the point of annoying on slippery streets. The other feature that is very inconvenient is if you drive in snow or mud it collects on the inside of the wide rims and if it is below freezing puts the wheels out of balance. I have had to go to a car wash twice while travelling just to wash the rims out. the last time it viberated the car so bad I could not go over 40 mph. The sun roof also developed a leak after only 7000 mi.,The sliding rear seats. Great for 3rd row passengers entering and exit. Electric rear door.,GM has done an exceptioal job of producing a stylish crossover vehicle.My wife and I find the dash controls to be a little cluttered. The dash looks very impressive especialy at night but requires the driver to take his or her eyes off the road for to long. Do something with the wheels.
4.75,1st. GMC,Gramps ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Handles great, comfortable to drive, quite and rides smooth. So far the fuel economy is unfortunately poor at around 15mpg. on the Highway. Too soon to pass judgement on the mpg. and expect it to improve.","Handling, AWD,sound system. ",None at this time other than mpg.
4.875,Great Family Ride,Desaree ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My husband traded in our 98 Oldsmobile Aurora for this crossover.  It's the first SUV we have owned.  I am pleasantly surprised at how smooth this vehicle drives.  The interior is very well designed and convenient.  I haven't had any problems to date.  I was worried about driving an SUV since I have only owned cars, but I feel absolutely safe and secure in this car.  The kids love all the space in the back, and they also enjoy the ablity to play their own music or CD's.  The fuel economy is ok I expect it to get better with more miles.  I am so happy with my husband's decision to get us a reliable safe car while he is away.  I have only owned GM cars, and will never own anything else","I enjoy the controls on the steering wheel.  The size of the interior is Awesome for a family.  Rear parking Assistance, and automatic starting of car.",None 
4.5,Best vehicle for the money,acadiaowner ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,3,5,"The Acadia is a good value for a 6000 pound crossover SUV. It has a good ride and decent performanace. I came out of a Tahoe and had to get used to the V6, but I must admit GMC did a pretty good job with the 275 available horses.","I got mine loaded with all of the options I could get, it's the best way to enjoy the vehicle. I particularly like the navigation and back-up camera features. ","The one thing that needs some attention by GMC is the way that the transmission up-shifts, it's a little hesitant. It's probably a matter of getting used to a 6 speed automatic."
4.875,Great Ride and Comfort,Pete Montalvo ,12/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have about 3k miles on my Acadia and am very happy with it.  I usually get about 21-22 mpg on a tank of gas, not too bad for new and I notice the faster I go, the better the mileage.  The tranny seems abit sluggish through its changes especially around 45 mph, but even that is improving as I use it.  The ride is great!",I have remote start and love it. The ride is superb.  The XM radio is a blast and the OnStar feature is great.  I like the versality of it going from a 7 passenger vehicle to a cargo hauler as I need it.,Trying to utilize all the buttons and switches on the console can consume too much time and takes your eyes off the road.  
4.75,2008 SLT2 AWD,Deuce ,12/09/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I have had this vehicle for 3 weeks now and love it . It drives like a car. If you accelerate slow and study and try to keep it under 2000 rpms it will obtain the gas mileage as stated on the window sticker. GM has really hit the mark with this vehicle. Fun to drive. ,"The whole vehicle is the complete package. I have all the options, So far they are all great!",It would be nice to have a full size spare tire. 
4.875,2008 Acadia Rocks,"West Chester, OH ",12/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Got one of the first 2008 Acadia's and we love it!  Replaced a Chrysler Town & Country.  GM has done an excellent job with this vehicle, it continues to exceed our expectations.  One minor problem with the power driver seat motor, but I won't take it back till it's time for the first oil change.  Our gas mileage started out low - near 14 MPG but increased to near 18 MPG after 2500 miles.  We have the AWD version.  The heads-up display, nav and back-up camera work extremely well together.  The sound system is also great.  Only other wish was for bluetooth, but I'll add some aftermarket version - the rest of the vehicle is awesome, maybe the best vehicle we've ever owned.",,
4.75,2008 SLT-2 AWD,NYUnderground ,11/22/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"As I'm sure most of you did, researched extensively prior to purchasing a new 2008 Acadia SLT-2 AWD.  Options: DVD Entertainment, Twin Sunroofs, Tow Package and 2nd row bench seats.We traded in our 05 Accord to get something bigger after the addition of our 2nd child and I am really glad we chose the Acadia.  After driving and looking at at least 10 cars in this very over croweded (gd for consumers) market segment we decided on the Acadia becasue of its looks, feel and overall comfort.My wife has never driven an SUV before but is able to drive this cross- over with ease, although backing up (even with parking assist) is still a challenge.","The DVD entertainment is great for the kids and the skylights are very nice.  The interior ergonomics are great, with ample storage everywhere and well laid out driver controls.The power remote liftgate and remote start on the SLT-2 are worth it as the truck automatically adjusts the cabin temp.",Few but there are some.  The backs of the leather seats on the 2nd and 3rd row are not leather but rather some velco looking cover.  The gas mileage will depend on how you drive and I think this is where the transmission complaints come from.  Drive on a gradual accel curve and the tranny is fine.
5,MIni-Van Killer,Clinton ,11/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just bought the vehicle a week ago, and it has been great.  We live in the mountains of Salt Lake and it has no problem with power. Love the fit and finish of the vehicle, as well as the car like drive.This really is the perfect vehicle if your wife hates the mini-van, but needs a mini-van. This car has mini-van advantages without the image abusing looks of a van. ","Heads up display, driver controls, and seating for eight comfortably.

4.875,Another great product,SharieLinn ,11/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We are a loyal GM family. This is our second GMC SUV, and it is the greatest. Has a smooth and quiet ride.

CX9 stiff drive, low power, mean you really got push it, very complex cd/radio controls, but good turning performance. Acadia is much quiet in side, no road noise, power better than CX9, seat design better, more space in 3rd row seat. ",All,More standard options
5,Almost Perfect,Dennis ,11/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was considering a truck or truck based SUV, but high gasoline prices made me consider the Acadia. So far my mileage is just shy of 21 mpg for the first 3000 miles based on a 50/50 city/highway mix. Handling is much better than in previously owned SUVs; passenger/cargo space is also much better.  This is a big, heavy vehicle that feels nimble and has reasonable performance. ","Styling, comfort, and powertrain are all worthy of mention.   ",Vision to the immediate rear is very poor. Consider buying the optional rear vision camera if you have small children.   Aftermarket cameras ($100) and a rear mirror ($40 - I purchased on-line) are available at a more reasonalble price than the factory system which requires the navigation system.

Room for all my wordly possessions! very comfortable to travel in. Mileage is as good as I expected; certainly good for a vehicle of this size and power. As noted by others, trans is sometimes a little ""busy"" but power is more than adequate.",Electronic conveniences. Multiple presets on radios including mixing bands. Heated winshield washers clear dirt and bugs very effectively.,I miss my Acura's ability to program nav while moving. Sunroof opening is limited by second seat skyroof which is probably superfluous.
5,Love My Acadia,bill3 ,10/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is by far the best vehicle I have ever driven. I have always driven SUV's, but this crossover provides the best of both worlds. The ride is superb, and the interior has so much room and great features. We looked at just about every suv and crossover w/ 7 passenger seating. Nothing came even close!   I was nervous buying a vehicle that was such a new model, but all of the reviews I read were very accurate. This vehicle is one that actually lives up to and even exceeds the hype.

4.875,GMC is Tops in the Crossover Market,Craig Turner ,10/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We spent six months testing and researching all of the so-called top crossovers - Lexus, Hyundai, Honda, Mercedes,Ford Edge, Lincoln, and Mazda.  None of them could hold a candle to the Acadia in size, gas mileage, comfort, versatility, driving ease, quiet, and ride.  I was really taken by the smoothness and quick acceleration despite being a 5,000 pound vehicle and the ride reminds one of a large luxury sedan but corners exceptionally well and not the least bit sluggish.  I strongly recommend the seven passenger configuration as the best option - Like a living room on wheels.  Your neighbors will hate you when you pull it into your driveway.","7-passenger seating; interior space, smooth ride, easy driver controls, entertainement system, exceptional handling, great gas mileage for a full size SUV - Avg 27 mpg for first 2800 miles. ","Suggest step rails because of vehicle's greater than normal height, additional second row storage compartment without having to purchase an optional rear console, larger side view mirrors would be helpful. The angled mirrors take a lot of getting used to."

The capacious interior was second to none. The amount of interior storage is unsurpassed. I ordered one with everything and a second row bench seat and waited nine weeks. The rearview camera is a must since rearward vision is limited due to a small rear window. The transmission is still somewhat reluctant to downshift. ",The HUD and HID liights are great. The power liftgate and Nav system are very nice. The dual sunroofs are a cool feature. The interior space/storage is fantastic. Bose sound system sounds awesome with an ipod or MP3 disc.,A V8 option would be nice. An opening rear window would be appreciated. A smoother shifting transmission. Some plastics look cheap. Also a full-size spare would be nice.
5,No More Minivan,A convert ,10/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,We just turned in our Toyota Siena and bought our first American-made car.  I think GM cracked the code on this vehicle. We have 3 kids and my wife wanted the convenience and functionality of a minivan and I wanted the look and feel of a sporty SUV. The Acadia has it all.

I just cannot believe it is a 5000 lb vehicle.  The gas mileage is good and the performance is better than I expected for the weight. I am impressed with how quickly it will move when I need it to. The shifting is smooth as silk and I continually am amazed at how quiet the interior is.

We're stuck at 14MPG in mixed town/highway driving and can only get to 19 on the highway. Given the 6 speed transmission I don't understand why we can't get more out of it.
