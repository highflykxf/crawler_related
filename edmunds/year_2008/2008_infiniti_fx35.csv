4.125,Family Vette,ckadventure ,09/19/2012,,,4,5,4,5,,4,4,3,4,"We have logged nearly 50K miles in our FX35 sport/touring AWD. It handles like a big corvette, very tight & sporty feel. We use this vehicle as a daily driver as well as for vacations out of state, as it gets 24mpg Hwy vs 18mpg in our Land Rover. It has some of the quality that Nissan is known for; however, it is pricier to maintaine. Surprisingly, I have had a wheel bearing fail, multiple recalls/warranty repairs & two break jobs all within 50 thousand miles. My wife enjoys driving this vehicle, but I am not sure if I will keep it once the warranty expires. ",Extreme exterior styling does not grow old. Factory exhaust note is aggressive. Good ergonomics. Decent fuel economy for an AWD sporty SUV. ,"Breaks are horrible! I am strongly considering an after market replacement all the way around. They are the weakest point in the SUV. Sunroof has failed multiple times & is noisy. Apparently the wheel bearings do not hold up well. Very random electrical issues. Finish on factory 20"" wheels pitting. Cargo space is TIGHT, just large enough for groceries or a few suite cases for travel & nothing more (unless you have no passengers in the rear seats which fold down) The legendary Nissan quality just is not there & we have owned a few. Cost $50K new, probably would have been better off buying a new Pathfinder & a used sports car."
5,A great step up,schnellerkerl ,04/10/2012,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Traded in my 328XI Sportwagon - Wife just wanted something bigger. And While I never had a problem with my wagon - BMWs are just too non-user friendly. What no dip Stick? - Come-on...Besides the FX looks better than an X5 or X3. Lots cheaper.Had a 1991 Q45 and it was a blast - so I thought the FX might work - And I was not disappointed.Great car one I worked out the APPLE-bluetooth issues and the IPOD connection that was never mentioned in the manual.Now I am working on a slight shimmy that seems to be indicative of the 2008 FX. But its not enough to keep m from enjoying the car. I'm just a little OCD about my vehicles.,Handling and simplicity of the car vs BMW.,"A few more standard amenities at this price would be nice.

A 6- speed manual would be awesome."
4.875,Almost Perfect,Seattle Steve ,11/05/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Moved from a BMW 5-series wagon; wanted AWD, fun to drive, utility, and reliability.  FX35 meets all criteria: engine is very strong, handling is great, interior is roomy and comfortable, and the back has plenty of room for anyone except those with large families.  Appreciate the small touches such as puddle lights, interior storage,  and rear view camera.  Averaging 20 mpg in mixed city / hwy driving.  Size and performance is very similar to a Porsche Cayenne, but at a much lower price. Engine has a distinctive growl that's very enjoyable in spirited driving, but can be a distraction at times. Purchased used with 25k miles, have driven 5k miles now with no issues.  No regrets leaving BMW.","Acceleration, comfort, handling, and Bose sound system.  Fuel economy is acceptable for a vehicle of this size and performance.  Base AWD model is very well equipped. ","Refine the noise-vibration-harshness of the engine, and add a bit more sound insulation.  Add automatic wipers."

4.25,"2008 FX35 AWD, Useless AWD",Don ,01/21/2010,,,4,5,5,5,,3,4,4,4,"Recently purchased a used, almost new FX35 AWD and unfortunately I should have done more research on the AWD system. The car features are fine and comparable to my X5, great stereo, etc.  Power is great and a fun drive but in snow you can not make almost any turn at any speed.  Just replaced the tires with brand new very good all seasons with great snow traction rating but the AWD system is simply useless.  Many electronic AWD vehicles when switching to Snow or 4x4 mode lock the front transmission.  FX35 simply lowers the low end power and I guess makes the system engage at lower levels.  Driving this car on snow is simply a scary ride and nothing like my X5, stay out of snow.","Great stereo, nice seats, keyless entry, power and reliability.  Had to add iPod interface, could not believe that the car did not come with it (cost almost $300, parts and labor)","Much improvement to the AWD system, needs to put the car in all wheel drive mode with front transmission engaged. The current system is simply useless. Better visibility, large blind spots. Paint also scratches very easy."
4.375,It handles like a sports car,sean ,12/28/2009,,,4,5,5,4,,5,4,3,5,"The reviews are correct: the FX35 handles like a sports sedan, but with a higher seating position and extra room.  The ride is firm, but comfortable.  You feel some bumps, but it's not harsh.  (I did not have the sport package.)  AWD, snow mode, and ground clearance meant that I plowed easily through a foot or more of snow.  Great in foul weather. You could sleep a night in the seats - super comfortable.  Very zippy engine, with a very nice sounding growl.  Just a sweet vehicle (I drove it new during a 2 yr lease).",Handling with high seating position; styling; seat comfort; AWD great in bad weather; rear-view camera.,"Fix sunroof noise; fix the XM radio display so that it does not cut off text; cruise control senses how far you are from the vehicle in front of you and adjusts speed accordingly - but does not work well in rain, and can't be turned off thus I subtracted a reliability point."

Handles much like the G35's and not really much difference in gas mileage. Love the look, the feel and handling. You do get used to the limited rear visibility, really you do. It corners and accelerates well. Very comfortable at all speeds. ","The look and comfort. Lots of fun to drive, city and highway. Seats are super comfortable. You feel safe in this car.",Can't drive with my arm out the window!! The door is just a bit too high or the window is not low enough. Drives me crazy. 
4.875,Husband's Car,lijana McDonald ,10/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My husband needed a new car, so I did my homework and found the FX35. I loved the shape and appearance of the car, it's a strong sharp looking car. We test drove the Nissan Murano, but the feel was different than the FX, I like the fact that the FX iss a rear wheel drive. Now... I drive the car every day & my husband drives the 2nd car.",Love the color of my car... Blue Rear backup camera,
4.75,Complete Satisfaction,JackieF ,09/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This vehicle has lived up to our expectations. The car continues to be a treat to drive, to look at and own. A year later, and I still enjoy looking at it and seeing other FXs on the road. It has a very solid ride, and is surprisingly responsive. We love every detail and the vehicle in general. We are sold on the Infiniti line!",The looks and the feel.,"Better organization of the center console, and the passenger floor has a bump in it, by the center console. It makes it difficult for the passenger to find a comfortable spot for their left leg."
4.875,I love my Infiniti FX35!,Patrice Boron ,04/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I admire the unique styling on the FX35 it feels like you are driving a sports car with the space of a CUV. This vehicle has been very fun to drive and responsive when power is needed. ,I love the back-up camera and unique styling. ,Increase the height of the side windows to make it easier to use the ATM drive-thru. 
4.75,Sport Sedan In The Shell of An SUV,Akhan ,03/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Recently purchased the FX35 2008 after repeatedly admiring it's aggressive exterior on the road time and again. The car is everything it's penned to be. The equivalent of a G35 with an SUV exterior. Acceleration is responsive and immediate, addition of iPod connectivity is nice (although not perfect). The luxury features are impressive (bluetooth, NAV, XM satellite radio). Gas mileage is a little weak (I'm averaging in the high teens/low 20's), but that is somewhat expected with the V6 275 HP. The BOSE sound system is fun to listen to, and all-in-all, I am quite satisfied with the FX. A definite recommend!","Exterior shape (unique, and so ugly it's beautiful!). Tech features are plentiful. Rear view camera is a nice addition. iPod connectivity is nice (although not perfect).","Gas mileage could be improved, iPod interface could be better integrated into the steering wheel audio controls, bluetooth phone book integration would be a plus. "
4.625,Superior to everything,G2 ,03/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"I've admired this car for years and finally bought one.  Now I wish I had bought it years earlier.  I have a 2008 with everything except DVD (No Kids).  When I am on the road and in traffic I feel superior to everything including the Range Rover Sport and BMW X5.  The only other car that I have driven that is even close to ""fun"" performance is the BMW X5 4.8, even then BMW just has power and cost substantially more.  The Infiniti has a sports car feel.  I'm still amazed today at how much it feels like a car rather than SUV.   When you buy the car, don't settle for standard, get the full package! ",Technology Package (Keyless system; Bluetooth Mobile phone; Navigation) Sound System; Big Tires and Wheels; Mean Looks.,None! The issue of visibility is overrated.  The mirrors are fine. I would rather have a push button starter vs. the turn knob (Note: 2009 made this improvement).
4,Not as Great as I thought,Jules ,01/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,2,4,2,"I loved this great looking vehicle on the road! Loved it, loved it, loved it! Until I purchased it! I was very disappointed the very first day! I could feel every tiny bump on the road, the steering wheel is very tight, therefore it's not very easy to maneuver. I also couldn't adjust the seat into a comfortable position, and was suffering from the back pain until I got used to it. I am 5,6"" and I guess this car is not for shorties. Moms, beware! The metal anchors are so deep, it took me about 20 minutes to install the car seat! Right now I got used to the car, love all other features:  Bluetooth, tech pack, back-up camera and keyless entry, but will be looking for another one soon. ","Bluetooth, tech pack, back-up camera, keyless entry, my 2 year old loves DVD! Love the interior and exterior! Mileage is not that bad! ","Please make a better suspension! Love the car, but don't like it's stiff ride! Would be nice if heated seats were warming a little bit more. When it's on low, I don't feel it at all!"

Three months later the check engine light turns on and has problems starting, the mileage at this time was 4800 miles. After 2 weeks at the dealer they told that the camshaft went out.  Very dissatisfied with this Infiniti. ",,
5,They put the SPORT in Sport Utility,Charles ,12/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Over the years I've owned a wide variety of cars including Porsches, BMWs, a 350Z, and a G35. I must admit that I was concerned that the FX was all show. It looked too sporty to be a true performer. I finally test drove one after a disappointing test drive in the Lexus RX350. I was immediately impressed. The vehicle has the tight and substantial feel very similar to the Porsche. The front fenders even have the same sloping bulge as viewed from the drivers seat. You truly have the feeling that you are in a serious performer, and it doesn't disappoint on the road. If you like driving excitement, this one delivers. Again, I've owned many performance vehicles and the FX holds its own among them.","The overall feeling that this is a strong, well-tuned, and well built vehicle. That it performs as well as it looks. I consider it more of a solid sports car that has ample storage and seats 4 comfortably. For an SUV, Great SUV gas mileage. I'm averaging 21 MPG with combined highway and city driving.",Not much. Infiniti did it right this time. Bluetooth should be able to upload and display phone book. Back lift gate should be powered.
5,Second FX35,Don ,11/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am in my second FX35 and really enjoy driving my 2008 model. My first FX 35 was a 2005 model with sport and touring packages. I found this to be the most comfortable, fun, and stylish car I've ever had and I've owned several luxury and sports cars. I test drove many crossovers and SUVs and felt the most comfortable being a big guy when I climbed back into my 2005 FX 35. If you want a stylish and fun car to drive check out the FX35.","Upgraded navigation system, keyless entry and ignition. Performance, ride, plenty of room for adults in back seat, and sound system.","Change angle of navigation display screen, hard to see in bright sun light, improve wireless phone system, too tinny and barrel sounding."

We own a BMW 325 I which is my wife's car. I wanted an X5. I can tell you after this drive that I regret nothing!!! This is a supreme and finely balanced machine and is not even the top of the line. The sound system is second to none and kept me entertained the whole route. I checked out a MDX, Acadia, X5, X3 and this puppy is a breed above. The local dealer test drive doesn't tell you the whole story. Wow!!","Satellite radio, iPod connect, handling, performance, smell, seat comfort.",Can't say just yet. None found so far!

Handles like a dream, very comfy, beautiful as all get out! Love all the bells and whistles moreover the price.. not bad. Wish MPG was better however I won't compromise its performance. I wish I can keep this car a secret but people are catching on! This is the sports package of a BMW M for SUVs with the safety rep of a Volvo for us soccer moms!

4.75,The Principal,DeoMac ,09/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,I LOVE the FX. It is so much fun to drive and I always get compliments about its appearance. Just the right blend of luxury and sport.,The appearance is second to none. It does not blend into the crowd.,The Bluetooth needs a little work. The iPod link is in an awkward position.
4.75,Love it,Bud ,09/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I've been thinking about a FX-35 for 5 years.  I always thought that the mileage would be too poor for me to consider.  Love a sporty driver that is practical - which defines an FX.  Wanted something bigger than my 07 VW-GTI.  Drove the BMW X6- nice but small, heavy, overpriced and lacks the fun to drive factor Love the FXs comfort, size, quality, sporty drive, high end finishes, feel of the wheel and those seats.  Big side mirrors enhance side visibility - with backup camera, I can park easily.  Haven't been this thrilled with a car since I bought my 92 Legend couple new.  If you don't put your foot into it, you can do OK with gas consumption","Styling, sporty drive, road hugging, cornering, stability.","Standard folding outside mirrors (parking spots are getting smaller), thigh bolsters."

I was most worried about the visibility b/c I read the vehicle has a lot of blind spots, turns out the mirrors are pretty good about compensating. My one main issue is a personal one - I am 5'5"" and having a hard time getting the right fit in the vehicle - I end up with knees dangerously close to dash in order to reach the pedals and  see well through the windshield at the same time. If I move the seat lower, the seatbelt is on my neck, if I move it farther back, I can't reach the gas pedal as well. I think it would be hard to find a good comfort level for shorties.",Automatic ignition and key FOB recognition. Rearview camera. Sleek styling - exterior and interior. Memory seats. Quality vehicle.,"Storage space - more of it in the dash center area, better design in the door storage areas, they are not easily reachable with the doors closed. Blue tooth - the phone function doesn't recognize voice commands very well, is too slow and not convenient. I get frustrated an end up using my cell phone"
4.875,Everything I expected and more,JB ,08/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The Infiniti FX35 combines the performance of a high performance sports car and the versatility of an SUV.  The 2008 model is sleeker and more high-tech inside.  Its performance, luxury and technology equals a lot of fun to drive!  Highly recommend it.","Perfect blend of performance, luxury and technology.","Sunlight creates glare on systems screen, which makes it hard to read during the day.  Suggest placing the screen at less of an angle or have a lip on the dash above the screen to reduce/remove glare."
4.625,The Corvette of SUVs,Cruzer ,05/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"I use my FX35 as a daily driver and my vette on the weekends. The FX has pep, performance, looks, handling,and a nice balance between fun and function. With the high gas prices I've been using regular and don't notice any change in performance. I get 19 mpg in city/highway driving. The vehicle is a 'headturner' since I don't see a lot where I live. The 6 cylinder is lively with a smooth 5 speed auto tranny. Styling is unique and built with quality in Japan. It is responsive whether driving aggressively or just as a normal commuter. You don't need a lot of options. I would skip the costly tech package but definitely get the sport package for performance and better personalize the exterior looks.",I like the adjustable driver dash pod with excellent power driver and passenger seats. Nice touch with the window washer located on the wiper blade. Very unique and effective. Nice throaty sound to the dual exhauts. Nicely set for the audio/heat cooling functions.,"Better gas mileage. Backup camera doesn't work that great at night or when raining. With chrome wheels and tires for the summer, and stock wheels and tires in the winter, it's a pain to have the dealer reset the TPMS each time you change wheels. "
4.125,Too much tech,Disappointed ,05/14/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,2,4,"With 8500 miles the FX looks like a keeper even though some of the techy stuff is frustrating. If the cruise is on and you are in a bend it will pick up cars in other lanes and stomp the brakes for you so you really have to watch where you have the cruise on. Bluetooth phone is garbage. Also the black chrome grill is all peeling off and Infiniti says they will change it once as ""good faith"" but it's my fault and not a supplier defect.",killer sound system,relax on all the techy stuff
4.875,Sweet,fxlouky ,05/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"One month in. No complaints. Everything it is built to be. Handling is heavy and stiff yet nimble. Great ride with spot package. Turns on a dime with decent radius. Great 30-60 pickup. As noted, it is thirsty, but know what you're buying. This isn't a Prius. Interior is sharp and sophisticated. It really only compares to MDX, CX7, LR2 and Lexus RX. And there is stand apart. Car should still look great 10 years from now. Well ahead of its time.",Style in general. Fit and finish. Good stereo and nice electronics. Expect great reliability.,Better iPod integration. Like everyone else I'd love better fuel economy but it is what it is.

4.75,Very Pleased,guitarist ,04/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"t's the nicest looking SUV out there, it's a blast to drive, and even the bare bones model comes with everything I need. The interior is wonderfully simple, the seats are very comfortable, the stereo is loud, and the engine really sounds sweet. It does accept regular fuel, a lot of it, but performance seems to be a bit better using the recommended premium. Acceleration is smooth and reasonably brisk, and steering is firm and sporty. I think it's a great value for the money.","The simple interior is perfect. Roomy, no wood trim, fantastic seats, it's very classy. The exterior styling is still a head turner, no doubt enhanced by the fact that there are so few of these where I live. With the exception of the mileage it's just magnificent.","Highway milage seems pretty decent, but in town this is a thirsty vehicle, and filling the 23.8 gallon tank is painful. Fuel price is outside of Infiniti's control, but there must be a way to make it a bit more efficient. It's so much fun that I almost don't care, almost. "

I beat on this car and its handling is great, just like a sports car, my customers and friends love the truck.  Back seat very comfortable. I like the heavy weight and agility, suspension, sound of the exhaust.  The roof rack helped with adding a snow board rack.    I will lease this same car when my lease is up in 21 months and thinking of giving up my porsche boxster.","Great - snow mode reduces wheel spin and power, lane departure mode and cruise control good for late night driving.

I am glad with my decision after driving FX35, just a bit bad in the economy department. Hurts when I'm filling up the tank but the moment I start to drive its all good, puts a smile on my face everytime I pull away from others and it's real head turner. Technically it's good in almost every department.","Sweet exhaust note, responsive, firm ride, sat. radio, iPod Interface, 20 in rims and everything.",Fuel economy. Personally I like Sirius.
4.875,Awesome Crossover,Tuan ,01/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The FX35 AWD is an awesome vehicle. The sport suspension is firm, but nowhere unbearable. The FX handles like a dream. Steering is precise and provides excellent feedback. I like the 350Z's smaller thick leather steering wheel in the FX. The interior quality has improved drastically from the early 2003-2005 models. Plastic and leather are MUCH softer. I have driven the GX, RX, X5, XC90, ML, GL and Cayenne. The best overall value in the midsize crossover is the FX. ","20"" wheels with the Sport Package. Much better looking than the 18's. Improved leather seats, bluetooth, AWD traction, handling - best handling crossover period.","More power or lose some weight, exactly what Infiniti will do in 2009. Better fuel economy. Change gauge lighting to blue. Orange is so cheezy. Better iPod input. It is now in the glovebox. Such a hassle. How about a docking station in the dash? "
4.875,Best Deal on a Luxury Crossover,Bob Hajek ,01/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,The FX35 has everything you could ever want standard.  It really does give you the feeling of driving a sports car.  There are only 5 FXs in our town (each a different color) - makes you feel very exclusive.  I keep getting comments from strangers about how sharp looking it is and this is a 5 year old body style! I'm very happy I decided to drive 90 miles.  ,"Exterior styling, great handling and as much power as anyone will ever need. The standard backup camera makes parking a breeze. The standard XM radio is great. It holds a lot more than I thought it would. We were able to put luggage for 3 people (2 wk.trip) in the back with room to spare.        ",The iPod interface needs to be refined. It works like a cheap add on. The back seat is very hard to enter and exit (narrow door bottom). The interior could use some wood trim. The BlueTooth HandsFree phone setup needs some work. Sometimes it works great - other times it doesn't work at all. 
4.875,Went from BMW 330 Convertible to FX35,katec ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I needed more room and had to give up the convertible.  I was really surprised when I test-drove this car and fell in love with it.  The FX35 has a great sporty look.  It handles as well as my 2005 BMW 330 CiC (with sport pkg).  I really enjoy driving it.  I have almost all the options - sport pkg, touring, handsfree, (except DVD player).  It's very luxurious on the inside; I haven't given up anything.  I can't imagine driving anything else.","Gorgeous leather seats, came with XM, navigation is great, and the handling is wonderful.",They need to automate the backseats to fold down & fold up (like they did in the new EX).
4.75,A lot of Luxury/Sport SUV for the Money!,Carnut from NC ,12/21/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I'm a confessed carnut and I think this is a great SUV. I've had a Porsche Cayenne S, BMW X5 and Lincoln SUVs prior and I think that this one is the most comfortable and certainly the best value for the dollar. I traded in a BMW 745i and as great as that car was, there is a lot to love about this car! Sporty, fun to drive, logical controls, very comfortable seats (I'm 6'5 and that is always a concern), and usable options instead of gadgets just to have gadgets! I would say luxurious as well. I got the sport package and did not notice the ride vs the non sport which I test drove as well. The 20"" wheels/tires look awesome as well as the other sport trim items that are part of the package.","Comfortable seats, and seating position, fun to drive, back up camera, smart key ignition, bluetooth cell phone connection, sharp exterior and interior looks, Bose 300 wattt stereo with 11 speakers & CD! Push button fold down rear seats, large chrome dual exhausts.","Better sound on bluetooth calls, somehow improved gas mileage? My wife would like lumbar on the passenger seat.

4.5,Great Value SUV,Great Value ,12/09/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"Purchased car new based on analysis among Lexus RX, Acura MDX, and Toyota Highlander (replaced RX).  By far a better value - great handling especially in windy road conditions - tons of standard features - options are reasonably priced relative to competition.  Driving comfort is second to none.  Back up camera is great feature as there is a blind spot in changing lanes looking out the rear sides.  Car is quieter than anticipated - on screen displays easy to use and make sense.  Best of all - can fit 3 sets of golf clubs in rear much like the RX - so many SUVs today cannot fit golf clubs in the rear compartment without putting the seats down. ",Handling (like a true sports car) - seat comfort - rear view camera - on board computer - great engine - best on market for smooth-quick acceleration.,Rear seat access could be better - harder for bigger/ older people to access back seat - Gas mileage in town is poor (15-16) - but highway mileage is good at 24-25.
4.875,Wow!  I was not expecting...,Richard ,11/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My wife and I both were amazed at how this SUV handled.  Coming from a BMW 3-series coupe and my wife from a Subaru WRX turbo wagon, the FX handled turns like it was on rails.  My brother has the X5 and it's on par with it.  The 3.5 engine is adequate but if you want a rocket get the 45 instead.  Fit and finish the vehicle is perfect.  All the amenities for the price makes it all worth it.  The comment by the editors about the interior being an elite Nissan, I agree somewhat but it's definitely more appealing than my BMW. Engine is smooth.  Suspension and handling are stiff enuff, so the Sport Susp. would be unnecessary IMO. You won't be disappointed with this SUV. Pull the trigger!","The aggressive, sleek look is an eye-catcher.  Keyless entry is key! Bose system kicks. Blue-tooth takes some getting use to but once you know the commands, it works like a charm.",Blue-tooth sounds a little hollow on the other end. A feature that would make life more simple is if you could download your phonebook into the car. Gas mileage... what can you do it's an SUV? Create an engine that takes regular gas but puts this much power out would be a dream.  
5,Great Choice,Bill- Atlanta ,10/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car has everything I was looking for in a luxury sedan but it is a SUV. I took my time looking for a new car and test drove just about everything on the luxury market. I am about 6'2'' and about 275 pounds.  It fits me like a glove.  Nothing on the market can compare with the comfort and performance along with the luxury at this price. I purchased the FX35 in early September and have not regretted it one day. It has power, performance, room, luxury, and is still decent on the gas. I am getting right at 20 mpg right now and I am not a real gentle driver.  I would recommend this car to anyone.",Keyless system. Sport package with the metal interior trim and petals. Back up camera. In dash computer.,This car is everything I ever wanted.
4.875,Rocking FX,JP ,09/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Just picked up an FX and I am completely blown away by it.  Traded in a G35 coupe for it and thought I would be losing a whole lot of sportiness in return for utility but that is not the case.  The FX has great pickup and handles very well for a 4100 lb car. It has ample room for cargo and believe it or not people have asked me about it and commented how sleek it looks.  All this makes me feel that I did the right move.  I do miss my G coupe but I feel I will have just as much fun in my FX. Anyone who test drives one will end buying it. That is how good it is... period!,"Performance, aggressive styling, comfortable interior, backup camera and the stereo system","Poor fuel economy (but then again my car only has 117 miles on it), extra glove compartment on passenger side (my G coupe had two!!)."
4.875,Sports Car in SUV Clothing,Fletch ,08/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"My wife and I have always preferred sporty vehicles so up until now have resisted purchasing a SUV.  The FX is a great blend of a sports car feel with  SUV convenience.  Handles great in mts.  Some reviews complain about the limited storage space but we find it more than adequate for most applications.  Some don't like the exhaust sound which we enjoy but if it bothers you, simply turn up the fabulous Bose sound system.  We were concerned about possible gas mileage issues but are getting almost 24 mpg on highway and close to 20 mpg in town. Over years we have owned a lot of vehicles but we feel the FX35 is the best vehicle we have ever owned.  Goodbye Mercedes.   ","Handling, seat comfort, back up camera, sound system, hands free option, appearance, tire pressure monitor that let me know I had picked up a roof nail.",My first bluetooth so nothing to compare it to but it has difficulty understanding my southern accent sometimes.  Preset does not work until you turn on ignition so you have to lock vehicle then unlock to get it to set to your programmed positions.
