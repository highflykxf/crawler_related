4.625,Beach blast,clamscasino ,01/23/2013,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"Had a ford f-150 for 11 years ,time for a big change,bought an 08 armada. This thing is a beast so much fun to drive around in.I drive it on the beach all summer and never been stuck or had a problem. As far as roomy, I put down the back 2 rows throw my dog in the back and it's like a one bedroom apt back their. As far as mpg sure beats the pick up truck. ","The best part about it is customizing it. I tinted the front window, I lifted the truck 3 inches , beefier tires( put a set of nitto tires on it.) black fuel rims ,cold air intake system for even more horse power, and a flowmaster exhaust system to give it a nice rumble

5,One of the best purchases I've made!,gs451 ,12/28/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Two years ago, I had been off of a my Lexus GX lease and wanted something bigger. I was interested in the new However, I just happened to stop by the Nissan dealer to look at the Pathfinder and fell in love with the Armada. It has everything that is needed in a vehicle of its caliber. The rear parking sonar is standard on the Armada while toptional on other large SUV's (should be standard on every large car for safety reasons). But it's been a true gem to drive and very reliable. Lease is about to end soon so I am looking into getting another Armada.I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking for an SUV. Poor gas mileage, but it is reliable, safe and has good resale value later.","REAR PARKING SENSORS! They are a god send...all big cars should have these standard they have saved me a lot of money as I am quite the clutzy driver and have a tendency to hit things, but with this car, not a scratch! I also love the On-board computer and the interior layout of the car, it is very spacious and allows for much space for kids to put their things in. I would also say the rear climate control is also very on par with the Lexus I had prior to this. My base model (SE) is such a value and I love everything about the car.","Try to improve gas mileage! I know its a big vehicle, but still it would be nice if they made more efforts to do so. I know its a longshot, but an Armada electric SUV would be nice kinda like the Volt? Other than that, this car is a value for the money and I think its packed with all the bells and whistles one could ever need for a family hauler!"
4.875,Love my 08 want a 2010,RECHELLE  ,08/02/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love my 08 armada, went from a 06 Toyota 4-runner to the armada for more room, 3rd row seating, & better ride. Discovered that it drove a lot better by 100%. We had no children at the time of purchase but had 3 dogs. Great family vehicle for evacuations from Louisiana & vacations, dogs love it. Didn't buy extended warranty at time of purchase because wasn't sure if I'd be satisfied & keep it past 3 years/36,000 mile warranty. Now after 2 years & 4 months & over 31,000 miles with now 4 dogs & 1st baby on the way any day now I'm ready for a 2010 with extended warranty this time. We looked at the Yukon & Tahoe but the seats don't fold down into the floor to make the back completely even.","My favorite features are the backup camera, rear entertainment system, & the adjustable pedal. Never to close to steering wheel great now that I'm pregnant.",The gas mileage could improve but it's worth it because of the space & comfort it brings for being as big as it is. I would also like the back to be extended like a Suburban or Yukon XL just for the extra room behind 3rd row seats for luggage or grocery shopping.
4.875,Brawler,Edward ,04/12/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"A full size SUV brawler, it rivals the competition I've owned a Chevy Tahoe, GMC Denali, Ford expedition Eddie Bauer 4Wd and they were all great vehicles but towing and room Nissan is the best. This truck is so plush and good looking, and gets a lot of looks. I feel very comfortable taking my family any where in this vehicle. It's to bad there going to stop making it, 2010 is last year of truck. Better make down to your nearest Nissan dealer and pick up one. Love the 9.3 gig HD stereo system.",Nav Bluetooth and Bose stereo,suspension feel in steering wheel.
3.625,If Only...,Audrey ,03/30/2009,,,5,5,1,1,,4,5,4,4,"I have huge mixed feelings about the Nissan product. I love the styling and the power, but there is no doubt about it, my Armada is a piece of crap.  It must have been built on a Friday when everyone wanted to go home.  Within the 1st year of ownership, the brakes squealed horrendously, the radiator had to be replaced because it was cracked, the rearview mirrors would not adjust upward, the transmission would shift roughly, the steering would shake while braking, and the list goes on.  It took 6 trips to the dealership to finally convince them the radiator needed replaced.  Now, there is a loud rattle when accelerating, the car needs a front- end alignment, and I'm stuck because of the economy",The styling and power.  I love the liftgate and back up camera.,Better quality construction.
4.5,My Biggest Nissan Ever!,Jim ,02/06/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,3,4,"We have purchased Nissans exclusively since the 1980s. Always reliable and sporty. Now that we have three young children, we found are 7 passenger 2005 Pathfinder to be too small for our needs. With gas at the time of purchase hovering around $2.80 a gallon, I was concerned about making the move to the Armada. Well, after a year, we couldn't be happier with our Armada. I was always drawn to the muscular exterior styling, but was never keen on the interior. Nissan did a great job with the interior makeover of the 2008 Armada. The quality of the leather seats is improved, the layout is logical, and all of the buttons feel solid. The information screen is really helpful. And we average 15mpg!",All the space!  Being able to watch DVDs on the information screen while docked!  The power lift gate is helpful.,"With 28 gallons of fuel to protect, how about a locking fuel door like all the smaller Nissans... what's up with that!"
4.875,Favorite car ever,Robster ,01/30/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After shopping SUVs for months I could not find anything that offered everything with power and room to spare.  This is simply my favorite vehicle ever.  It handles like a small car, is as quick as a sports car, has the room of a full size van with accessibility, all the technology a guy could ever ask for for a reasonable price.  The mileage is to be expected for a vehicle like this.  I just can't get over how satisfied I am with this vehicle.  I pull a trailer with a Diesel powered pickup and this SUV is not far behind on it's towing prowess.  I want to buy another one before they quit making them!","Music Box, DVD and the acceleration with traction control.","Mileage, but I didn't buy it for the mileage."
4.625,Still loving it!,Zoomnbyu ,01/06/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,4,"16,000 miles later and we remain quite impressed overall. The gas mileage average to date is 14.8. A few issues required a trip back to the dealer (rt ft strut blown, bad coolant cap leaking), but everything has been resolved to our satisfaction. One quality note: the alignment from the factory was awful! The truck darted around over bumps and handled horribly at first. I performed an alignment myself. It made a HUGE difference in the truck's composure! The front AND rear suspension is adjustable. Request that all be adjusted and get a final printout!  The Armada serves our needs to a ""T"". I have no reservations in recommending it to anyone needing a large SUV!","Strong and responsive powertrain (this thing flat out rolls on demand!), good balance between ride and handling, Bose sound/XM, good overall interior design and comfort, multi function computer has handy features and information.","Chassis not fully sorted out (gets ruffled around the edges/shudders over larger sharp bumps), the gray dash/door trim on the SE looks cheap (why not the brushed finish as on the center console?), abrupt wind noise around front door frames with sharp cross winds, OEM tires will be worn by 25K miles."
4.875,Awesome SUV ,Peppershaker ,10/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We bought this last week and we traded in a 1997 Nissan Quest with 135000 miles and never had it in the shop so we bought another Nissan product. This truck is the bomb and it gets 16.5 with a K&N air filter around town and 19.5 on the hwy, so if your looking for a great big SUV this is the Truck. Our old van only got 16 in city and 21 on the hwy so there's not much difference in the fuel economy, and the power is awesome with the 5.6 liter V-8 engine.",The info center is nice and the room for eight with three kids is great.,They should make it standard with the DVD system.
4.875,Awsome SUV,peppershaker ,10/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought this used with the intention to buy a new Chevy SUV, but after owning an Altima for 8 years and putting 175000 miles with no problems. I had to test drive the Armada so we did and liked it much better than the Chevy Tahoe. I have three kids and they have all the room in the world to move around and we are getting ready to buy a new camper so the towing cap. was very important to us. We get about 15 miles to a gal in the city with the k&n filter in it . We love this SUV. If you're looking for a dependable truck this is it. We will drive this one for ten years and put 200000 miles before we need to buy another. ","The information center, the room that it has and towing cap. 9100 lbs. ",They should put a DVD in standard.
4.875,I love this more than my mustang!,mustangsally_y2k ,10/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I cannot believe how I have grown to depend on this car both summer and winter.  I bought it for a winter vehicle but we have used it to tow our 20 ft travel trailer and it pulls so much better than our truck!  It is so comfy for my 6 foot frame that I like to drive my car everywhere instead of being the passenger in another car!  I love the way it handles and I feel the safest I have ever felt when driving a vehicle.,"The soundproof interior, the leg room and the automatic rear hatch.  The second seat leg room and Bose stereo is awesome.",GPS for standard edition would have been nice.
4.5,Not Sure?,Christy ,09/11/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,3,5,"Just purchased my new Nissan Armada a little less than two months ago and I've already had it back at the dealership for service 4 times! I'm a little disappointed because I love this vehicle and my husband it now wishing we would have stuck to a Chevy or Ford! I have had the sound system already replaced because the back four speakers never worked, the sunroof worked on because of the loud rattling noise it made as you drove down the road and it had only been opened twice and I've also had problems with my windshield wipers/washers and it's not even due for the first oil change yet!  This is my first Nissan and they have yet to prove to me what they stand for!","Room, interior design, Bluetooth/nav/MusicBox, captains chairs, exterior look, power third row seat","Gas mileage, real woodgrain, better leather"
5,Best full size SUV ,Jessica Woods ,09/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Had an Expedition and decided to go smaller so I went with a BMW X5.  What was I thinking?  Had the BMW literally for 10 months and researched full size SUVs.  The powerful Armada has been hands down the best SUV that I have ever driven.  It's driving performance is incomparable to any other ride out there.  My Expedition had a ridiculous amount of play in the steering wheel and such a narrow wheel base that I felt as if I would flip over.  With the Armada you get an extra wide wheel base and can turn on a dime.  I thought that parking this beast might be an issue but watching my passengers freak out when I whip into a parking space without any problems is a great testimony to its control.,"Rear camera great for hooking up the boat trailer.  Love the power lift gate and auto sensors.  Amazing towing capacity and power.  Towed our boat (a 6,000 lb Wellcraft cabin cruiser) 300 miles and couldn't even tell it was behind us.",None!  Fuel economy???  You don't buy a large and powerful all mighty V8 for fuel economy!
4.875,Who could ask for anything more?,Ellis G. Sr. ,07/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased my Armada as a replacement family car.  What a vehicle!  This is the 8th Nissan I've owned since my first in 1983 that I put 250,000 miles on with 0 problems aside from normal wear & tear.  Nissan rivals any competitor in quality for less $$$. I priced a comparably equipped 08 Toyota Sequoia and literally $10,000.00 later, well you do the math.  I own a 91 Toyota 4runner and I like it, that's what made me take a look at the Sequoia but for the money, I just couldn't justify purchasing it over the Armada.  I think the Armada looks better as well. Excellent power, 9,000lbs towing, wonderful interior and instrumentation, roomy and very comfortable.","Keyless starting, auto lifting rear lift gate, 3 zone climate control, Bose stereo w/satellite, power, power, power.  Roomy and comfortable and for an SUV very tight turning radius.  Fit and finish, perfect.  DVD entertainment system.","Only one. The manual tuning knob for the radio is a little far away from the driver, should be closer. Some say better fuel eco, but you can't have power and economy at the same time, at least not yet. Perhaps a hybrid, but whats that do to future repair bills? Maybe offer in a turbo diesel."
4.75,Nice design,rmada ,06/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I had a 2005 Armada which I liked but wanted leather and dvd player. traded for the 08 model and the ride is much better. The interior is redesigned and more comfortable. Only real problem is the gas mileage, but it's only a family hauler and it doesn't get driven as much.",Exterior and ride,Better gas mileage.
4.75,Love it and options!,mack ,05/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"LE 4X2 loaded! Love it! Spacious, nice interior, lots of power (if you need it) Just like a Q56, just $16,000 cheaper! Captains seats, DVD, NAV with touch screen, CF and Music box with  XM. Power rear tailgate and power 3rd row! Sporty, and nice interior styling. ",Music Box and Bluetooth! Space is great too.,"Option for Sirius radio! Perhaps a 110 volt outlet in the SUV somewhere, and put the DVD plaver in the middle row somewhere. Also maybe a better subwoofer. Good mids and highs, lacks bass. Maybe the new engine economy (shut off a cylinder or two on the highway). Also more controls on steering wheel. "
4.5,The Armada is great,Jim ,05/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,1,5,"It's everything I need in a big SUV.  I have a boat that I trailer to different lakes and need dependable power.  I like the big, brawny ride and I like sitting high in traffic.  The ride is very good.  I enjoy running around in the Armada.  ","The harddrive, where the navigate maps are stored as well as music from CDs.  VDC makes it a safer vehicle, keyless entry, E85 fuel option.","There are so many great options that makes it hard to say anything negative, but, IMHO, it needs autolock, airhose (since there is a compressor for the shocks), daylight running lights, selectable nav options while driving, and autostart."
4.875,2008 SE Armada,Dennis ,04/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Just bought the 2008 SE Armada last week and love every driving minute. Interior is big and roomy, with lots of quality features. Exterior is bold and brawny, turning many heads with each passer by. Wife loves the security of transporting kids in such a safe vehicle. Previous to this purchase, we owned 2005 Pathfinder and never had a single issue.","Towing, interior space, ride quality, exterior appearance, cargo capacity, backing sonar, 2008 radio display, the list goes on.","Gas mileage. However, it's easy to overlook when you get so much more in return. Spent 75 dollars to fill tank, and lasted 10-12 days with regular use."
4.875,The BEST Full Size SUV,SacMada ,03/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Researched full size SUVs for 2 yrs and the hands down winner is the Armada. Great engine power & drivetrain that is silky smooth. Plenty of towing power with 317hp & AWD function. Very nice cabin touches with up to date technology & styling. The ride is stable and feels safe to haul family & friends.

3.375,Disappointed,margie ,03/27/2008,,,5,5,5,1,,4,5,1,1,"I changed my 2004 Suburban for a 2008 Nissan Armada (LE). My Armada is 6 months old and we are very happy with it. The only thing is that I should have paid more attention to the reviews I had read about the Armada not being stable on the road. If you drive the Armada even at 40 miles the truck loses control. The other day I got very scared because I was doing 60 on the freeway and the pavement is not smooth in some places and I just lost control, the good thing is that I had both hands on the steering wheel. At this point I'm very concerned for the  safety of my kids. Please test drive on not so smooth pavement!",9 gig music memory! I put in a cd and it records it in a folder for future use without the hassle of having tons of cd in your truck. Bluetooth is awesome!,Performance on unpaved or uneven road. Fuel definitely!

4.625,2wd LE,padjfl ,03/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"We have had our Armada for two weeks and really are enjoying it.  It has everything needed in a large SUV  power, refinement, safety features, and roominess.  The mileage is low but, it is a fair tradeoff for the excellent utility and to have the family in a large, safe vehicle.  The Armada blew away the domestic SUV's in interior materials quality and features, especially for the price.  Nissan really did their homework with this vehicle and it shows.","Back up camera, front/rear sonar.",Automatic locking doors when vehicle is placed into drive or reverse.
5,"Stop Looking, This is it!!",Chris ,03/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After some long thought I chose the Armada over a Tahoe. After owning a week I wonder why I ever cosidered a Tahoe.  Fully loaded this baby comes with options that would have cost $5000 more than a Tahoe.  Everything fits perfect, rides better than our Suburban, has more power.  My only problem is why I did not buy one sooner.","DVD, back up camera/ sonar, Intellikey system, power third row seat. ",Remote start.
4.75,Living large and loving it!,Zoomnbyu ,02/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"We replaced an '03 Expedition.  We went with the Nissan because we could get it equipped pretty much exactly the way we wanted it. Almost a thousand miles later we have really fallen for this truck. A few quibbles so far would be only a couple of interior fit issues and a booming noise in gear at idle. I would complain about the gas mileage, but that would be pointless! You get what you get in MPG when you buy a behemoth like this (I rated comparable economy). With three kids, frequent family trips and a boat that gets used nearly every weekend in the summer this quickly becomes the ultimate family vehicle!!!","Three zoned climate control, park distance sensors front and rear, rear park camera, power rear gate, Bose audio with XM, multi function display screen - overall interior design is really good!","Seat memory SE model would be nice, sunroof should be available without having to add leather package!

More than a quarter of those miles were in 4x4 mode on dirt and snow covered roads living in Colorado.  After test driving several other large SUVs, I couldn't find anything that was comparable in terms of ride and extras. The engine has good torque for driving up steep grades while carring several people and loads of ski gear.  The extra leg room in the back makes for a very comfortable ride for everyone on long road trips. I plan on having this vehicle for a long time.","V8 engine, comfortable ride, 7"" LCD monitor, rear camera, rear seat leg room, and auto rear lift gate.",Tow hitch should be standard feature on all models.

We purchased a loaded SE, since the LEs that we found all had the captains chair package. The Armada drives nicely, is comfortable and roomy, and gives you plenty of cargo space.

The ride is fantastic and fit and finish is far above all American competitors.  Turning radius is great too.  7 inch LCD in dashboard is very functional and nice looking.  2nd row leg room and comfort is superb in Armada.  Drove 200 miles all freeway and got just over 16 mpg so not bad.  Lots of power to spare with the v-8.  Got a nissan extended warranty when purchased.

We looked at the new Sequoia but I was again disapointed with the bland styling and plastic Tundra interior :(.

I narrowed down to the Infiniti QX56, the GMC Yukon Denali and the Armada.  When compared side by side, there was no question... the Armada won.  The legroom and comfort are incredible.  The fuel economy leaves a little to be desired, but it is a huge SUV!  I am 6'8"" tall and with the driver's seat all the way back, I can easily sit behind the driver.  No other vehicle found had that much rear legroom.  Bells and whistles galore plus it looks great!","Legroom and comfort.  DVD player, navigation, voice control, bluetooth technology, fold in mirrors for pulling into/out of the garage, intelligent key.","Chrome wheels, improved gas mileage, GPS selection while moving. Air conditioned seats."
4.125,Glad I chose the Armada,David ,08/11/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,2,4,"Needed to tow horses. Looked at the Suburban, Expedition, etc. The Armada had more standard safety features and more convienence features than the others. Second row legroom beats any other SUV (by far), and the nav/voice system is best on the market. However two areas could be improved: 1) the suspensions ""shudders"" when driving over broken pavement.  2) the seats aren't very supportive - although the truck has little body roll, the unsupportive seats magnify this effect. I'm fortunate enough to have owned LX 470s, RRs and G500s and I still find myself driving the Armada most of the time. If you prefer a ""richer"" environment, consider the QX56.","2nd row legroom, fantastic nav/voice system, bluetooth. Keyless entry, rear view camera with front and rear parking sensors.",Seats aren't supportive enough and you can't purchase real leather as an option. They're basically vinyl seats. Suspension shudders over rough roads. 2nd row torso airbags to compliment the head airbags.
4.75,My New Armada,tsawife ,07/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"We love our new Armada!! We have only had it a few days but so far it is the most smooth, comfortable ride. I traded my Isuzu Ascender (which I loved by the way) and was a bit unsure that the Armada could live up to the expectations that I had. Once my husband and I, who are both very tall, sat in the middle and back seats, we were sold. It is so roomy and comfortable to ride in and to drive. It doesn't have the best gas mileage but luckily I work very close to home and all the room makes up for it. My 2 sons love that feature also, as they can each have their own row of seats with lots of room and they feel very safe riding in it. I hope we love it as much in 5 years as we do today!!","Definitely the roomy interior. Also, I love the exterior design as it looks big and rugged but also classy. ",Better gas mileage?? :)
4.5,Very nice truck,ken ,07/16/2007,,,4,4,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"This purchase has been a very good one for me. It feels so cozy inside while driving that I don't feel like getting out. The drive is nice b/c of comfortable leg room and elbow room. Gas is good while traveling, but not in the city. I'm still glad I purchased one. For a big vehicle I don't have any blind spots b/c of the design of the vehicle and big mirrors. Trust me you will enjoy the power the beast has.","My favorite features are the navigation system, dvd, bluetooth, automatic rear liftgate, and intelligent key.","Automatic start up, better gas mileage, xenon headlights, heat/cool seats, retractable side boards, more leg room in the very rear of vehicle."
5,Love the Armada!,nctravellinman ,07/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I travel a lot in my job, and wanted a safe vehicle.  The ride is amazingly quiet and smooth. The power liftgate is just too cool.  Bluetooth works better than any of my previous models, including Motorola factory bluetooth. Voice recognition can control heat / cool, radio, and phone. First adequately sized A/C I've had on a vehicle in a long time. Backup camera and ultrasonic sensors really help parking, along with the power folding mirrors. Radio has great sensitivity and clarity (I like talk radio on AM), but Bose system severely lacks fidelity.",Air ride suspension. Intelligent key. V8 power. Fit and finish is great. Very comfortable seating.,"Relocate the engine oil filter so you don't have to remove 6 capscrews and skid plate to change. Like most OEM nav systems, Nismo's is a toy, imo. I reinstalled my Garmin 7200 Streetpilot. Pick a better stereo supplier than Bose."
4.5,Great Truck,edmercedes ,06/23/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,2,5,"Love the space, great improvement from the 04 ride, not as bumpy, a more plush drive. Still drives like an SUV but does not rattle as much as the earlier models. Great improvements on the panels and quality of materials. Being a previous owner of the 04 and 05 models I can assure you this is a great improvement. Love the ride. Love my truck!","Hands down the voice command, satellite radio and the 9gig hardrive to store music. The technology package is worth every penny. I highly recommend it.",The drive can be a little smoother. The armrest should be a little steadier and should return to the 04 style where the armrest height was adjustable.
4.875,Amazing Ride,Dara ,05/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We purchased this car because both my husband and I are 6'4'' and we have a baby who needs to be seated in the center.  This is the only car that allows us both leg and head room and PLENTY of room for other passengers to sit and be comfy.  We have our seats all the way back and still have plenty of room in the second row. We also love the front sensors and the rear view camera, nav system and the new touch panel display radio system.  The hatch and third row move with the push of a button and the ride is smoother then a Cadi without a doubt! You will LOVE this car.  ","Touch panel, rear view camera, front sensors, power hatch and third row seats, nav system the extra wideness of the inside and the amount of room for passengers and cargo.","AC'ed seats, auto lock on the doors when car is put into gear and unlocked when put into park, lights on the running boards and latch system in the middle of the bench second row seating."
