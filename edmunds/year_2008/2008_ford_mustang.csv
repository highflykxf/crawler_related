I have to be ""good"" on the road, or I getmarked because the car looks like ""trouble brewing"".  It can rumble in a purring way, or take off when the path is clear.  Either way, it has always been fun to drive, especially with the top down.  Only problem was the long wait to have the Takata airbag replaced. Ford shouldhave been more supportive.",,
4,Very reliable!,Adrian ,03/23/2016,3,4,3,,,5,5,5,4,,,"I bought my 08 in 2012 with 75,000 miles. The previous owner must have driven a lot but even though the high miles, my car has never let me down. It's 2016 and the car still works great. I've kept up with its oil changes, and minor maintenance and my Mustang keeps running without trouble. I've replaced the alternator, tie rods, sway bar links, shocks, struts and tires and of course the battery. I drive this car daily and it still amazes me at how great it handles. As of today my car has about 110k miles. Any time I get in it I can feel sure that it won't let me down. I always brag to friends of how reliable the car is. I over paid for the car but at least I can say I haven't put money into it.The only downside is the interior. The door vinyl panels have started to come off. I've tried to glue them back but with the Texas heat, they come back off. Also the cloth on the seats isn't all that great.

4.25,V6 Premium w/Pony Package Review,eddyrock21 ,02/18/2015,,,4,5,5,4,,4,4,4,4,"Purchased a V6 Premium Mustang w/Pony Package and the 5spd auto with 84k to replace the wife's Pontiac G5 GT that gave us nothing but problems. The car is in great condition for the year and the miles on the vehicle. The car is mechanically sound and in great physical condition. The Mustang has already done its duty by keeping the wife safe when she hit a patch of black ice. The car sustained basically no body damage, just some rear suspension damage. Definitely satisfied with the purchase at this point having put 3,000 miles in the 4 months of ownership. The gas mileage is acceptable for the type of vehicle as we are averaging around 19 city and 24 hwy. ",The factory HID's are a great and unexpected feature for the price point of the mustang. The information system and my color display are nice features as well as the illuminated cup holders. The shaker 500 system is a great bang for your buck. The car handles phenomenally both on the hwy and in the corners. The power from the V6 isn't bad considering the year of the vehicle and the technology available at the time. The vehicle came optioned with nearly every option available for the year except for the leather seats. The addition of ABS and traction control is a huge plus considering these were not standard in 2008. ,"Since purchasing the car no real issues have occurred. I have performed regular maintenance such as; oil change/filter, fuel filter, cabin filter, spark plugs, and cleaned fuel and injector system. The only possible issue is the wrench light that has appeared once which indicates the TPS (throttle body position sensor) had a fault; a common issue for this vehicle and a simple fix if need be. A simple restart of the car cleared the issue. The light also occurred shortly after I had cleaned the filthy throttle body/induction system which could have been the cause. Automatic lights would have been nice, but that was addressed in the newer mustangs."
4.25,My first Mustang!,justinc8 ,01/03/2013,,,4,5,3,5,,4,3,5,5,"I've always wanted to own a muscle car and Mustangs always seemed to intrigue me the most. I didn't have much knowledge about automotive performance before I bought this car, I should've done more research but I do not regret my purchase. This car is VERY fun to drive on the street. I know 300 horsepower isn't much in today's standards but don't let that number fool you. The car does still pack a punch. Gas isn't so bad either, of course when buying a car like this that shouldn't really matter. I average about 19mpg. Ride quality is decent but not horrible. The seats are nice and comfortable which is a plus. Bottom line, the car is nice and extremely fun to drive!","The car is very easy to maintain, I mean c'mon it's a Ford! I've also put a few mods on it which make it more of a thrill to drive. I installed a pair of Pypes Pype Bomb Axle Backs and those really take the sound of this car to whole new level. I have a few other things done do it and more to come! ","The quality of the interior isn't the best, lots of plastic everywhere. But that's not why I bought this car.

4.625,I LOVE MY CAR,pdxcarguy ,06/21/2011,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,5,5,"This car is a great value and Ford did a wonderful job merging classic design into a modern world.I get around 20mpg (18 if I rod around) in the city and up to 26 on the hwy.I think that the dark blue version is the best color and while my car has a grey interior and black top, I think that the best color combo is the dk blue with tan interior/top.Nevertheless, I get comments on my car all the time - this car is great for meeting people!!LOL!!I upgraded the lousy tires that Ford ships with the car - I went from being able to take a 45 mph corner at 55 to 80++!!If you test one and question it's performance I would suggest checking on the tires . . . ","Without question the Shaker 500 stereo is my most favorite feature - it truly is Awesome!
It sounds great and blows away anyone who hears it.
I can't believe that there is a more powerful version!!
Something else I was impressed with was when we had a snow storm in Portland that shut the city down I found out that I could easily get around in my Mustang.
I drove past SUVs that had slid into the ditch and could go up hill without a problem - in a Mustang!!
The car is so well balanced that I could go anywhere without worry in a car that I figured I would have to park.","Okay, so the reason I'm writing is because I think the electronic nanny (also know as traction control) is dangerous.
While it is impressive when it is slick, it is SCARY when it is dry.
In the Portland metro area we have plenty of 45mph roads that you may need to pull onto.
You can't just ease onto these roads - especially in rush hour!
So, when you step on the gas and expect to pull into traffic and the electronic nanny cuts the power it can be a terrifying experience!!
I shut it off every time I get in the car.
It should be something that defaults to OFF - I HATE that you have to turn it off instead of having to turn it on.
This is a major safety flaw that I hope is corrected."

I have spent thousands of dollars on maintenance for it, having to replace part after part. Just a few days ago my engine light came on. I thought it was no big deal and I'd take it in to get checked out sometime. Well I was sitting at a red light, it turned green, I gave it gas, and it died on me. Right in the middle of the road. It started back up and as I began to drive it, it died again. I had to spend another $157 on it to get the cool air intake problem fixed. And of course the warranty has covered none of the many repairs. I had a Toyota before this car and never had these problems. ","The car looks pretty and is fast. It is very unreliable and you will do nothing but pay alot of money fixing it all the time. It is a 2008, it's not like it's some old clunker. I like muscle cars and I wanted one. But the money I've spent on it is flat out rididulous. People buy newer cars so they don't have to spend alot on repairs. With a Mustang you'll have both.

5,excellent all-around!,Alan ,03/31/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My main focus is to drive a car that doesn't make feel bad about the purchase price or the fuel economy. My V8 gives me 24.7/MPG combined city/highway. I have the power when I need it and the smooth ROAR to brag about it. I didn't pay through the nose like I would have with some other performance cars and the looks are great. It doesn't have the girlie bells and whistles, like my wife's car does, but I didn't have to pay for them either. It's athletic, handsome, inexpensive to maintain, and it's american made and proud of it. Don't just buy one, buy two for the price one foreign made! When you're old and cranky spend your money on a luxury expensive car that only an expensive mechanic can fix",Handling is precise and sharp. Power that makes you feel it's an exension of yourself.

I thought Dodge Charger is more refined and comfortable, mustang behaved like my 1997 Ford Explorer though I thought Explorer is better in comfortability. But the moment I drop down the top it became totally different species all together. I became the center attraction, and it was fun to drive around in neighbor hood with loud music on. Better than my 1999 Camaro Convertible. All complaints are vanished! ","Retro; unmistakable American Muscle Car look, nice interior design (not quality), leather seats, black carbon fiber dashboard look, convertible is a winner all the way.","C'mmon guys, V6 4ltr engine with 210 bhp? Charger has 3.5 engine with 250 bhp. If you guys doesnt want to change that ancient truck engine, please fix a turbo and increase the bhp for god sake.

4.875,Bullitt has great performance value,Dave - San Jose ,03/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just purchased #4523 in 2/09 and I love this car. I have been in the market for a new car for 5 years and I test drove many cars like the 350Z, RX8, 370Z, EVO VIII, IX, and X, all of which are very nice cars and definitly worth considering. The Bullitt is suprisingly comfortable and head space is very generous. At 6'7"", this something I need to consider. Ride is firm but not overly stiff. Nothing beats the power and torque curve of a V8. The other vehicles do not have that brute force, authoritative power that the Bullitt has. Also, all of the afore mentioned vehicles require 91 octane fuel and the Bullitt does not. Bottom line: This car is fun, fast, and relitively practical.","Understated retro styling make this a very attractive car. Comfortable seating and quality materials used for the interior. Let's not forget the powerplant and its wonderful exhaust note. The handling is great, especially for a car with a solid rear axle. The ability to run 87 or 91 octane fuel.","More hp would always be nice, but realistically there is no place to use it (leagally) and I don't know if you could run 87 octane if it had more power.

I agree with everything the editor said in his review about the mustang, it's a really nice car for the first 5,000 miles or so. Check out the TSB service bulletins for the mustang before you buy one! Many problems, engine misfire, water leaks by the buckets from dashboard, auto tranny failures,can't fill gas tank,and Ford is the worst at fixing the problems. They give it the sunshine treatment for the expensive problems until your warranty is up. I have replaced the trans, a/c comp, alternator, 3-batteries, power steering pump, and more!

4.25,Bullitt Mustang gets it right,mrolfers ,02/25/2009,,,3,5,4,4,,5,4,4,5,"Ford got the Bulllitt Mustang right in so many ways: I love the low-key, retro styling cues throughout.  No stripes, no fins, no flames, and very little chrome. Slick shifter, engine pulls hard, and has a satisfying muscle car exhaust note. I owned an '86 GT and this thing handles like it's from another planet. You can actually throw it around curves without the rear end breaking loose  at the slightest tap on the gas. Excellent seats and very comfortable on a couple of 300 mile road trips. I'd like another 200+ HP or so, as the car does run out of power before I'd like, but I couldn't afford the Shelby GT 500. I rarely get to drive it that hard, so it's a mild criticism.",Bullitt package extras well worth it. Front seats are spot on for a  6'/200 lb. guy. Engine and shifter just beg you to drive it hard.  My two kids fit in the back seats. Ipod jack in the console is nice. Sound great.  Understated styling works for a 40 year old.,"The two cupholders in the center console are a joke.  If you actually put a drink in them, it blocks the shifter.  Needs a telescopic steering wheel.  The car arrived from the factory with a malfunctioning stereo and an annoying squeak from somewhere in the back when driving over bumpy roads."
3.875,A graduation present,Ryne Mitchell ,02/06/2009,,,5,5,3,3,,5,4,1,5,As far as comfortably priced and comfortably equip sports/muscle cars go this is the best I have ever driven. With leather and an appearance package tacked on to this little V6 you don't need much more. With 210 horsepower (I'd argue there was more) this V6 will kick any little 4 banger out there to the curb while not quite being dangerously powerful. If your looking for power and style with a reliable name and company look no further.,"Responsive acceleration in any gear, air vent design (found myself playing with them at stop lights), and customizable gauge color. ","A reluctance to turn at increasing speeds with chattering and chirping tires, cold weather causes the car some problems in shifting out of low gears, and police seem to follow you regardless of how you are driving.

4.75,2008 Bullitt,Jeff--San Diego ,01/17/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is an absolute blast to drive. Who ever said American car companies don't build cars people want? I will line up any Toyota, Honda, Nissan, etc. against this baby. For the price it can't be beat. First off the torque is unbelievable. HP is immediately available. No need to wind this baby up. You won't want to play the excellent 500 watt Shaker stereo radio as the exhaust note is the best sound you will ever hear. I test drove 20 different cars but when I got in this one I knew I was going to have to purchase it. Very easy to have fun driving around town and you will get 17-24 mpg on 87 octane. Fill the tank with 91 octane and hold onto your seat.  ",Favorite feature is the awesome torque and HP of this free breathing engine. The exhaust note is just right. Not to loud but powerful enough to say it means business.,It would have been nice if the console between the seats was a little more useable but I guess that is the price you pay to drive a sweet machine like this one.  
4.375,Only one of its kind,Barryg ,12/25/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,4,4,5,"If you want a mean sounding, torque pounding, rumbling V8 with a 5 speed (like I did), with modern day comfort, the Mustang GT is it. Leather seats are comfortable. I installed 3.73 gears, lowered the car 1.5 inches with Ford racing springs and added the FRPP GTA axleback mufflers that come on the Bullitt Mustang. The car is set up the way it should be and with the mods, still under $26K. The GT is raw and the ride is a little on the rough side but it's so much fine to drive. Gas mileage for me is around 20 overall. If you want quiet and refined look elsewhere. If you want a solid fun RWD V8 at a great price with unlimited aftermarket support, get the GT. No regrets at all! ","RWD, V8 sound, torque, power, aftermarket, comfortable leather seats",My only gripe is that many of the 5 speeds have a 2nd-3rd gear grind when the car is cold (overnight). There is a recall for this. For now I go to neutral then 3rd the first 2 or 3 times. And anything in the cupholders gets in the way of shifting.
4.75,Bullitt Brings Back Muscle Car Basics,Craig Brown ,12/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I have owned a few Mustangs and typically leave the exterior plain and spend the time and effort on modifying the engine and suspension. My wife and I both saw a 2008 Bullitt in the Highland Green and were immediately drawn to the car's understated simplicity of styling that made the cars we loved as teenagers such classics. Then I drove one!  The changes are subtle from the 2006 GT I have been driving for 3 years, but the suspension is firmer and the shifter is more precise. The power difference negligible over the GT, but the car just looks and sounds right.  If you grew up driving V-8 muscle cars in the 60's and 70's (or wanted to and couldn't afford to), this is your car!","Straight-forward styling (no scoops, wings, spoilers.

The ride is not as smooth as the Marquis but it's not luxury or as expensive. It handles much better than the diesel F-250 but that's expected. Sometimes the manual adjustment for the chairs gets annoying especially while driving but I guess drivers should adjust everything first.  Cruise control is very precise and simple and even thought the media controls aren't mounted on the wheel, they are still very close. I control radio etc with my wrist resting on the stick.  A bit bumpy but great handling","Steering wheel, exterior design","Some materials are a bit too cheap. The speedometer isn't centered so the readings are at an angle, thus distorting the readings. I have to lean to make sure I'm reading correctly. The back seats could use an extra 5 inches or so. Glove box or the center console could use some more space"
4,Fun on a budget,stangit08 ,10/31/2008,,,3,5,4,4,,4,3,4,5,"Three to four dollar a gallon gas prompted me to look for something besides my 3/4 ton truck to drive. I didn't want to spend more than $20K but still wanted something fun to drive. I seriously looked at the Solitace, Miata, and Mustang. The Pontiac and Miata were at least $8K more for compariable cars albeit they were rag tops. Ford was offering $5K in rebates bring the price down to $16K drive off. The base Mustang comes with many of the desireables that are option on the other models. I have taken two trips over two hundred miles and and averaged 30-31 mpg on both trips. Combined city/hwy driving this week averaged 24 mpg. The car is a blast to drive and looks great. I am very pleased.","Handling and styling are what I like most about the Mustang. The addition of a MP3 input and power jack in the center console are also nice additions additions. From a safety standpoint, the Mustang now has side airbags. The gauges are old style but I love them. I also like the fold down rear seats.",Use less plastic surfaces. The dash is totally black plastic.

Evertime I look at it in the parking lot I think what a cool car, then realize it's mine. Magazines complain about the handling, but the stock tires are rock hard since Ford expects people to actually drive the car unlike other manufacturers (this means they last longer). For the price you simply can't beat the performance you get back in return.

I added a hurst shifter, chrome 20"" wheels, side stripes, things to make it look better. I must admitt I do get a lot of ""Nice Car"" comments. Probably because I have over 100 coats of wax on it.

I've been averaging about 17 mpg even though I put my foot into it with regularity. Another nice thing in this day of high gas prices is that the vehicle runs on either premium or regular unleaded. With regular unleaded, you supposedly lose a little torque, but I can tell you that you don't notice it. A good compromise is the plus grade if available.","Minimalist look ~ it doesn't need a bunch of appliqués to look sinister. Lowering the suspension makes this thing really hug the road.

I owned a Blue 1965 Mustang 2+2 fastback in 1969, got my orders for Vietnam, then sold the car. I ordered my car due to the retro look, I love it. Vista Blue with all the goodies. I am disappointed in the lack of a quality clear coat on the paint. I have less than 1200 miles on the car, with 2 paint chips on the hood, plus a pebble put a ding in my windshield.

This is one amazing car for the money. The sad thing is that these won't be available for long. The same thing that killed the original high output V8 vehicles in the early 70's is killing this car today ( oil and it's availability and cost).

There is nothing better then the sound of a V8 with 320 lbs of torque. The manual transmission is probably what makes this car so exciting to drive.

Shaker 500 really Shakes interior and your eardrums. Exterior looks great. I love the late 60s early 70s throwback style. Exhaust sounds great even stock. Sounds the way a V8 should.

I have had no problems with my GT. ,Little backseat room. No light or cupholder there either. I can't seat anyone behind me because my chair has to be back for the proper clucth let out and I'm only 5'11. Head room is skimpy in backseat too.

Ford offers the same price whether you buy off the lot or get it custom, so why not get what you want? We live in Pittsburgh, and I have had to drive the car several times in snowy and icy conditions. It handles as well as a rear wheel drive sports car can (with a few cinder blocks in the trunk). The dealer told me the 8 cylinder will not - I definitely believe him now. I love to drive this car, and it looks great in Grabber Orange with the Pony Package added.  We also got the ambient lighting, MobileEaze, and interior upgrade package. The accessories are well worth the price.  Enjoy!","Responsiveness of the V6 is better than I thought. The MobileEaze is a must if you're buying a standard (and why would you not buy a standard?), but the person you're talking to will hear some static. The interior upgrade package with the heated leather seats might be my favorite part though...","The windows aren't framed, so when you open the door the glass slides down about half an inch, and when you shut it the glas slides back up into place.  When there is ice on the window though, the glass can't go down, and when you try and shut your door it feels like the window will break. Not good."

It does have a fault however.  The gearshift lever vibrates and resonates when accelerating which takes away from the otherwise pleasant experience. It also has periodic squeaks and rattles from the front that just can not be found. Drives me crazy and the dealer can not find or even agree that the sounds exist.

However, while it's a cool ride, it seems very prone to manufacturer's defects in the drive train.

Seating position is good, but car feels big because the doors are up so high beside you.","Heated outside mirrors as standard.  A little more legroom in the back, but that's about it.."
4.5,Old guy car nut,jack osborn ,08/18/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,3,4,5,"Have owned 40 automobiles and am a professional engineer.  I am an official car nut. This is a beautiful automobile, California special.  But, if you are 60 years old this car will beat you up when driving our poor roads and I drive 40k per year.  Am going back for an Edge.  Ford has improved drastically.  Had previous SHO and station wagon and piece of junk. These are high quality. Would recommend this car, but only for those who can put up with the ""boy-racer"" situation.  Ford should be commended for their improvements.","Power, looks, quality for type of automobile, stick-shift, no rattles, powerful audios, wheels.","6-speed, smoother ride for old guys who love cars, more luxury even with higher cost (for old guys), a little too much tire noise for this type of car.
