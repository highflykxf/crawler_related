4.5,"Great car, maybe a touch expensive",rohkey ,08/05/2014,,,4,5,5,4,,4,5,4,5,"A little baffled by some of the poor reviews I have seen. I'm 24 and have been driving this car for 2 years now, and I enjoyit. It's spacious, comfortable, quiet, and powerful enough. Never noticed any major handling issues other than the large turn radius, and sometimes it can be difficult to park in large spots. Also there seem to be a few blind spots that can get you in trouble if you're not cautious. The interior isn't as fancy/elegant as I would expect, but it's not bad, and I like how the exterior looks. The trunk is pretty huge, and there is plenty of room for my 6'5'' frame (something I've had problems with in other cars like the Malibu and Impala). MPG's are pretty low, however.",,
1.75,Buick....this car makes me sad,alpineweiss ,01/11/2011,,,2,1,3,2,,1,3,1,1,"This car is unbelievable in so many ways. Unfortunately none of them are good. The exterior styling is hideous, The car drives like you are in a sensory deprivation tank, and the interior is cheap and uninspired..unless by inspired you expect ugly and cobbled together by a committee of old car company fat cats. I have had the misfortune of being stuck with this car for 2 weeks now (loaner). I can't wait to give it back. The steering column controls are backwards and overly complicated, and everything in the interior feels like leftover parts from a 1990's car. There is good reason for this, its because they are. Most parts you find on the Lucerne have not been updated since 1994 or before.","My favorite feature is the seat warmer, honestly thats the only thing I like here. The settings wont burn your behind, nor will they leave you frigid. They got that part perfect. The grill stickers on the front quarter panels of the car are fake. An attempt at styling that seems like some marketing clown came in and said ""Hey guys! my focus group that we spent 200Million on says that people like grill thingys"" so they went and stuck them all over the front. Did i mention that they dont do anything and they are stickers? I really wanted to root for this car, i really did, but instead for my trouble i got what should have been called, the Buick Bovine. ","Dear Buick,
They truck unlock key is basically a catapult. Unless you intended this to be a siege engine for storming castles please have a look at the trunk opening speed. It opens so fast I am sure it has clocked one or more old people in the chin when opening it. The emergency brake pedal sticks about 8 inches out into the cockpit so when entering the car its like the car stuck its leg out and trips you on your way in. Lastly, please stop building cars by committee, You end up with something that is neither attractive nor functional. You spend 3 billion on RD for a car, and end up giving people what they already had except worse. You need a transfusion of new blood. Lucern is embarrassing."

Problems - the tire pressure monitored showed an inaccurate reading.  Took it in and they rebooted the computer - Problem fixed.  Apparently the fact the car did not move for a couple of months when I was abroad was the problem.

Let's see..... thermostat problems, took 2 attempts to fix that.  The trunk that leaked in the rain and to top that the dealer's service center couldn't get to it for a week (smell that, would ya?). Then there's the gas cap that just fell off.  Wish I paid closer attention to the poor turning ability and less to the cushy seats.

Sturdier headliner where the universal garage remote buttons are.
5,Quietest car I've ever owned,chillaw ,06/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is our sceond Buick. I am very pleased with the quality of construction. The sound-proofing is so good that I can't tell whether the engine is running when stopped at a traffic signal. Bought car in New Orleans and drove almost 200 miles home on a 1/4 of a tank. The gas needle didn't move until we had driven 107 miles. I'll keep buying Buicks as long as they keep making them like this. A very nice car for the money.,,
4.375,Buick is impressing us,Al ,05/28/2008,,,5,4,4,4,,5,5,4,4,"This has been a great vehicle so far. After looking for several months for a replacement to our Chrysler 300 we settled on the Lucerne. We have not been disappointed.  A great smooth ride and quieter than any other car in its class. I am 6'4"" and room was important. This car gives it. The power of the Northstar is impressive without giving up too much gas mileage. It is not as responsive thru the transmission or the steering wheel as the Chrysler 300 but the ride far out weighs that loss.",The quiet and smooth ride. The power and ease of performance with the Northstar 8cyl.,Turning radius is disappointing and the trunk space is somewhat limited for a car of this size. The biggest negative is the inability to read the instrument panel in the daytime. Buick has got to fix this problem.
4.625,Comfort and Class,frank ,05/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Use this car as my sales office. Had a 2005 Lacross CXS, wanted a bit more room. Ride is very quiet and comfortable. Handling is what you would expect from a luxury cruiser of this size and price. The V6 is suprisingly quick and have never felt underpowered merging on the Freeway, once at cruising speed you have to watch your speed because 90 sounds and feels like 70. Memory seats, heated steering wheel and seats and very comfortable and supportive seats makes long distance drives easy. Get it with the premium sound system, worth the money.   ","Luxurious interior, sedate but classy styling, competent performance and smooth quiet ride. Excellent fit and finish.","Blue Tooth conections, more electrical outlets, less fake wood."
4.875,Buick is Great!,Paul ,05/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased a Buick Lucerne in April of 2008. This is an outstanding car. If you need a full size sedan that comfortably seats 4-5 people...some of them 6 ft 6 inches tall, and rides so smooth and quiet you wonder if the car is running.. you should get this car. I have several kids in college and I have to drive them 5-7 hours one way to get them to school and visit them during the year. A comfortable roomy car was essential. None of the foreign cars could comfortably seat my son who is 6'6"". He either hit his head on the ceiling or had no place for his legs. The Buick was perfect. Quality is outstanding. Performance is excellent even with the 6 cyl engine. Mileage is averaging 21 mpg.","OnStar, GPS. Quiet, smooth, a pleasure to drive",None
4.375,Underpowered,david ,04/25/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,The car has a great ride. It really is underpowered for its size.  Tried to merge onto a highway and get out of the way of a truck almost got ran over. The standard radio is not very good either.  Replaced the air filter with a k&n got 27 mpg on the highway.  I liked the rain sensing wipers.  They went faster or slower depending on how hard it was raining.  ,"Leather seats, sunroof, rain sensing wipers","More power, better standard radio."
4.375,Not your daddy's Buick,Chasarms ,04/04/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,3,4,"I have been an SUV guy for a while and really shopped hard for a larger car before deciding on the Lucerne. I drove several comparably priced imports and found nothing that offered the luxury of the Lucerne as well as the roominess. I also drove a Caddy STS. A nicer car, but much more money. I found the CXS Lucerne holds its own pretty well against the Caddy. The styling is elegant inside and out without being boring or too ""mature"" looking. The car handles well and has plenty of power. The Northstar engine has all the pickup I could ever want. By far, a must have on this car. The ride is quiet and comfortable. I have not given anyone a ride in this car who hasn't commented positively.","The Northstar V8 makes this car great. I liked the styling of the car in general, but I don't think I would truely ""enjoy"" driving the Lucerne V6 every day. It's far too avg. The CXS is more money, but worth it. You get a lot of extras besides the motor. The Harmon-Kardon stereo sounds very good. ","Bluetooth connectivity for cellular phones. It is ridiculous that it not available on a $38,000 car. I would also like to see a tighter performing transmission with the Northstar. It can be a little sloppy at times. I would also love it if the back seats folded to create an open space to the trunk."
4.5,Love my CXS,Sorun ,04/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"Traded my 2003 Deville DHS for it. I like the styling, car looks nice with the 18 inchers. Ride is better than my old Deville and the seats are more comfortable also. The handling and steering are tight with the magnetic ride control and steering. The acceleration seems much better than the Deville too.",Quiet comfortable ride with a sweet sounding V8 if you need to pass someone quickly.,"23 on the highway is accurate , don't buy it if you are looking for fuel economy."
4.875,Luxury Cruiser,luxo ,03/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"What a quiet ride. When you start the engine, the growl is so calm, you have to check if it's started. Love the pearly white. Also the bench seat where I stretch out and know I'm not going to hit the shifter. The 3.8 liter engine is enough for me. The engine is so quiet, I caught myself on the freeway going 95 mph. Very comfortable","Pearly white, 6 passenger bench, quietness, ample power. Does not feel like it only has 197 hp. Feels more like 225.",Put more closer gears
5,Elegant Auto,Lynne ,03/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I love this car. It has everything I need and is beautiful to drive and to look at. All the options are very useful and interior room and comfort are great too.,"Blind side zone alert, land departure alert, park sensors, remote start, memory exit seat, heated steering wheel, rainsense wipers",Just a few more horsepower would boost performance I think.  But reviews say very eco friendly car.
4.125,Missing Park Avenues,Olson ,03/01/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,2,4,"The Lucerne is quiet, and comfortable. It's as good as any import in its class, probably better. I do miss the 30 MPG highway and 20 plus city I got with our Park Avenues with the 3.8 engine. The best so far is 27MPG freeway driving and 17 city with this CXL. ",I like the quiet comfort as well as the XM radio.  ,Get the 3.8 fuel economy back to where it was on the Park Avenues.
4.875,2008 Buick CXL,joe168 ,02/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have owned many Buicks over the years. They have all been great cars, but this one may be the best. I love the looks, the smooth, quiet ride, and the quality finish. I have had the car for more than three months now and have driven almost 6,000 miles. I am still enjoying it. ",My car is Crystal Red Metallic with chrome wheels and grill. It's a great look. I quickly realized benefits from the MagnaSteer feature when abruptly dodging an animal on the highway -- Wow. It provided great control. I have also come to really appreciate the car's XM radio and iPod port,"The normal gas mileage is in the 23-24 mpg range. That is respectable for a car this size, but it is less than my previous Park Avenues and LaSabres. It is hard to see out the back window when backing or changing lanes. (I do have the back-up sensor, but sure wish I had the lane change sensor)."
3.75,Overly sensetive accelerator,paul ,01/30/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,3,4,3,4,Since purchasing this vehicle and driving it 1500 miles the gas pedal drives me crazy. with the slighest touch the tack will jump 500 rpm and drop the same just from driving on a rough road.  Cruise control on takes the problem away. dealer says buick has no fix and says it is caused by drive by wire system.  I have two other cars with this system and they are OK. Rides rough on bumpy roads compared to Lexus ES330,"Heated seats, styling, except for grille and fender vents, love the red color. Heated steering wheel is nice at -20 degrees","Improve gas mileage. 22 on highway is best I have gotten. Fix the touchy gas pedal, raise driver arm rest.  More hp on 6 cyl. The old park ave. had no trouble getting 25-30 on highway"
4.375,New Lucerne Owner,Alan ,01/06/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,3,5,"I am a big man (60"" waist 32"" inseam) so finding a vehicle that I fit in is the first step. I am quite comfortable with plenty of leg room, its a little squeeze in and out but I took it for a 300 mile drive and thoroughly enjoyed it. I love the heated steering wheel and seats, and that was something that I really didn't want but to get the features I wanted they came on the car.  The turning radius is not as tight as I would prefer. The blind side alert and lane alert work quite well. Those are two feature I wanted. The night driving is excellent, my old vehicle had too much reflection and glare.  I hope to drive this for a long time, my first two tanks of gas are in the 20 mpg range. ","Blind side alert, heated steering wheel and seats, very quiet ride. I enjoy driving this car","Lower the center console, raise the driver arm rest, put the seat controls where the can be reached easier when driving"
4.25,2008 Lucerne,Glenn T. ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,2,5,,4,5,4,4,"Bought the Buick because of the ""quiet interior"" advertising and ratings.  Interior has an annoying rattle under the dash (started at 1400 miles).  Dealer did not get it fixed when brought in for repair. ""I think we fixed it, but if it still rattles, bring it back"".  I expected more from Buick.  Every day I hear the rattle and I am dissipointed.  If not for that, I would be very satisfied.  The vehicle rides nice and handles well, and the price is reasonable for what you get.","Aux input on radio, up-level speakers and amp, blind-spot detection, heated seats, remote start.","Center arm rest is too far back, foot hits aux electical plug in seat bottom when getting out, should offer an I- Pod connector as an option (not just an aux input), multi-disk player should be more quiet when changing between disks (6-disk on random play)."
5,Best Buick ever,Gene Lander ,11/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The Buick Lucerne CXL is the best Buick or car that we have ever had. The quality of the fit finish is outstanding. A super quite ride with none of the road noise gives you a refreshing finish after driving it daily or on a long trip. We have 9 vehicles one other 2007 and 5 restored colector cars that have all one best of show or people's choice.,The Lucerne has the nicest quite ride you can buy for the price. OnStar is a no brainer we have it on 2 cars and is a must have. The comfort in the fully adjustable seats is tops. drives like a dream.,Come out with  a hybrid
4.25,Crystal Red Tintcoat,Ron B ,10/29/2007,,,4,4,5,4,,4,4,5,4,"As a Buick owner for years now and wanting something ""different"" I went to Nissan,Toyota and Honda . They were nice but I didn't like the idea of them saying ""the cars sell good so we don't have to drop our prices "" and another one said ""Hay , try it if you want ,or don't , I don't care "" made me realize I would try out a Buick again . I just drove it on small local trip, maybe 200 mile round trip and sure enjoy the comfort . The driving of this Cx model is a joy and I feel very safe with the options included. The V6 has enough power ,the gas mileage is great(27 mpg) and yes I have standard options on this that I would've had to pay thousands for on the ""other"" cars. this is an aswome car.",Color is awesome (note title)and the quietness is amazing. It is so easy to drive and we love the mp3 port . But we decided to keep the Xm radio service . The comfort and roominess is a huge factor plus the OnStar and phone give us a great feel of security ,"Um, the 197 hp engine should be at least 230 or so, and that should come from a V6 not a v8 . Also , we have the bucket seats and the center arm rest is set ""back"" to where its not comfy. When on trips I like to rest my arms and find it hard to do it with this car."
4.875,Best Buick Ever,mm22 ,07/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,great performence with the 4.6L NorthStar. The fully loaded CXS is a true luxury car for a cheap price.,Magnetic Ride Control Stablili Track 4.6L Engine PortHoles,
