5,Most FUN car EVER!,Jeremy ,03/19/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"In my years of owning different cars, one car stands out as the most practical, the most fun, and provides the most absolute joy when driving. That one car is my 2008 Audi A3 3.2 Quattro with DSG. I have gone from (in order of ownership) 87 BMW 325iC to 99 Audi A4 2.8 Quattro to 02 Audi A4 1.8T Quattro to 05 Audi S4 Cabrio to 08 BMW Z4 Coupe (Sunday car) and 08 Audi A3 3.2 Quattro DSG (everyday car), owning the last two the same time. I was a bit torn deciding between the Z4 and A3 before I moved to Chicago. I decided I just need one car so I had to sell one of the two. Needless to say, I sold the Z4 and decided to keep the A3. Sure the Z4 was sexier, faster, and just had more prestige maybe for the lack of a better word, but overall, I simply thought the A3 was just the car to keep. I am glad I did. I didn't want to regret giving up the A3 again. Rewind back to 2009, I actually owned a 2007 A3 3.2 Quattro DSG in 2007. After two years, Audi offered to buy it back from me, so I did sell it to Audi. It was a mistake because I really missed that car shortly after. And in the U.S. production stopped that year. So I went looking for another but none available -- not the A3 3.2 Quattro. So for some time I had the 08 BMW and I got myself a Subaru Tribeca as my everyday car. By chance I went looking for another A3 again in 2012 and found my now 08 Audi A3. Hallelujah!This Audi A3 is pure joy to drive. I have gotten out -- without digging around the car first -- of 19 inches of snow here in Chicago in the Blizzard of Super Bowl 2015; I have taken corners in this car that I probably would not dare take in any other car; I have gone up a circular freeway on-ramp at high speed enough to scare (and impress) my friend while he hung on for dear life to the ""Oh Sh!+"" handle; I have passed many cars on an uphill climb without the engine gasping for air. And what's another thing that makes this car such a delight to drive? It's that buttery and silky smooth dual sequential gearbox (DSG). Whether I'm driving in automatic mode, or sport mode, or manual with the option to switch gears with the stick or paddle shifters, the double-clutch transmission is so silky smooth and quick shifting up and down. Of course, when down shifting it may not feel smooth as the engine will roar down-shifting at high speed, but that engine sound sure is music to my ears.I know there are other cars that can outperform this car out there. But for the what I get out of this 5-door hatchback -- 250 HP, 255-lb torque, DSG transmission, just to name a few -- there's no other car out there for me. I can now and honestly say, ""I love this car!""",,
4,Fun to drive. Poor to maintain.,Jay ,02/29/2016,3,3,3,,,2,4,5,2,,,"We bought 2008 A3 in 2015 with only 27000 miles on it.It is FUN to drive! It feels like a race horse wishing to run!  This thing is made for highway driving. It's ability to accelerate and maneuver is the best I have ever felt.  That said, it is annoying to drive in city. The least little bit of pressure on accelerator causes it to jump, sometimes too far too fast!It is very uncomfortable / awkard to get in and out of, and I am an average size American guy (5'8, 200 lbs).  The worst aspect is the inability to find qualified, reliable mechanics who are willing to work on the vehicle.   I have owned Ford, Isuzu, Honda,  and Toyotas.  I never had an issue with find qualified mechanics with those brands. Here, it took awhile to find one outside of a dealership.  Audi has a management software that few mechanics have access to, and I live in south Florida, not middle of nowhere Montana, North Dakota,  etc.!Also, due to low profile,  going over any railroad tracks or potholes can be annoying at best, or expensive at worst. We went over one, and fractured the radiator support, which needed to be replaced.  I saw later that it was made completely of plastic!  How cheap!  A front-end structural support made of plastic,  how cheap on Audi!",,
4.75,King of the Mountain,k2mtb ,04/11/2013,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"Considering how many times a season I head up to the ski slopes here in Colorado a 4wd hatchback was a must.Coming from a Subaru family I started my search there, but was put off by the WRX's insatiable need for speed.. however thanks to this site I stumbled upon the Audi A3 and haven't looked back since.I'm able to hold highway speeds in the worst snowstorms and the A3 doesn't even wiggle when charging through the midlane muck. Weaving in and out of traffic while pulling up I70 is a breeze, one swipe of the paddle shifter and I'm gone.But more-over, its the fit and finish that has won me over, everything is just as it should be and that coupled with the handling is pure eloquence.","The DSG, while it takes a little bit of getting used to is an absolute riot to drive.
Its nearly impossible not to get lost in a nicely tuned Bose sound system.
And I must also say, the ability of the ski pass-through to fit two full snowboarding setups makes a spur of the moment trip way too easy.","Be ready to increase the gas budget, I have a 50 mile daily commute that's in and out of the mountains, and with a car that makes it this easy to pass the van going 5 under in the left lane, its not hard to watch the needle drop.
I've been averaging 21.5 mpg driving it mixed between standard drive and DSG shifting myself.
Not too terribly bad, but I think that's the best I can get out of the A3 and its oh-so-easy to get much less."
5,"Fast, Fun, Reliable, and Comfortable!",jcj8 ,09/12/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have owned an Audi A3 for three years, and appreciate it more and more each day I drive it. The turbocharged 2.0T engine is very zippy and the short-throw 6-speed manual transmission makes driving the A3 particularly fun,but what really sets the car apart from its competition is its fantastic handling. The car loves curves and the tires stick to the road like glue. From the moment the car accelerates onto an onramp, the solid feel of Audi's suspension and quiet cabin give the passenger a sense of confidence at highway speeds. Even after three years of daily driving, nothing has broken on my A3 and its been to the shop only for its regularly scheduled and warranty-covered maintenance.","The tight turning radius and responsive steering at low speeds is very useful for navigating city streets and parking spots. I'll also add my praise to the already loud choir of accolades for the Audi 2.0T motor, which smoothly delivers well more than enough oomph for the little A3. It's truly a modern miracle how the A3 gets such great fuel economy while generating so much power.
The interior is very comfortable. All of the controls and displays are intuitive, and the leather trim is very plush and luxurious. The two skylights in both the front and back give the cabin an open and airy feel. The basic sound system is excellent and easily allows passengers to plug in iPods/iPhones. ","I can only recommend that Audi ship more of the standard transmission A3s to the US. I don't know if Audi is offering more manual transmission vehicles these days, but back in 2008 I had to call three dealers to track down an
A3 with a standard transmission and the color that I wanted. The automatic transmission is almost certainly faster 0-60 mph, but the 6-speed is just so much fun that I would never opt for anything else. On a similar note, I would love to see the diesel TDI motor offered here with a manual transmission. "
4.75,A3 Is my bad boyfriend,samascl ,05/16/2010,,,5,5,5,4,,5,4,5,5,"This car is all I ever wanted, fast, fun, charming, you don't see as many of this on the streets so it is even more unique.  I call it my bad ""boyfriend"", I am so in love with it, I can't move forward to another car and I know the car is a lot of trouble.  In a year in half that I have owned it, it had 2 problems, one with gas sensor and seal and today I am having jerking transmission and the dealer does not want to recognize it. I have read forums and a lot of people have experienced the same issue with the same dealer's answer. Buy it, you will love it, but be careful it can break ur heart when you start having mechanical issues. I still love it even that is problem car!","low profile tires, the skyline roof, the Lamborghini transmission that mine came with.  the whole car.","more reliable, this cars spent more time on the dealer that on the streets!"
4.625,Think it over,zhengsmassage ,03/31/2010,,,5,5,4,4,,4,5,5,5,"When I first bought this car I loved it! It is fun to drive, the stick shift is fast and with a few modifications this car can look nice. Good gas mileage, good sound system. I really like everything about this car except. It has given me so many problems. My car is only two years old now with 40,000 miles and currently in the shop again. My battery has gone bad after only two years! Unbelievable! I replaced the starter in the car twice, once at 8,000 miles and another at 20. Don't know how long Audi will cover it but I think there might be a bigger problem causing it. I also replaced the stereo system because of a malfunction and the windshield wiper sensor (hazard with no ww in the rain","fast, fun, interior design a plus, comfortable to drive. the manual is smooth.","Better reliability! I have an a4 and a a3, the a4 is older with 3x's the miles and it is more reliable! I have had to have the a3 towed 3 times. Thank god for Audi AAA roadside assistance."
4.875,Love Love Love It!,Jeannek ,03/24/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I had to get a 4 door b/c I was pregnant but I wanted as close to a sports car w/4 doors as possible.  After much research and reading, I found the A3.  I am a true car junkie- grew up reading my dad's car mags & this car does everything I need it to and more.  I have the S-Line & although I got the automatic instead of manual trans (hard to shift & find binkies), it is a blast to drive!  The acceleration esp when you go to pass is amazing- put your foot down &/or downshift & it just goes!  I know it's a little small (I'm 5'2"") but my 6' husband & tall step kids all fit w/my Britax car seat.  I love the hatch & when the time comes, I'll just get another one!","Performance, seats, controls and interior- I hate wood and love the S-line accents.",
4.75,I Love This Car!,Buck Greenlaw ,12/23/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is an absolute riot!  The A3 is truly an Audi, truly a German automobile.  One might be inclined to assume that the bottom-of-the-line Audi is just that, a tepid facsimile of the brand.  On the contrary, the A3 possesses all of the presence and character of a complete European luxury machine.  I continue to be amazed with the build quality.  The driving experience is just phenomenal.  The engine note is something that must be experienced; you'd never guess a small five door could sound this wonderful.  I could gush unapologetically about the car for far more than 700 characters so I will conclude with this summation: This car is sick!!!","It's not fair to make me pick just one. Therefore, I will go with the driving experience and the engine note.",Quattro + Turbo!!! Not one or the other.  (Audi has rectified this after '08)
4.875,Simply well done,phaetonboi ,08/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"It was at the Atlanta Auto Show that I fell in love with the Audi A3.  My current car due end of its lease was a 2006 VW Touareg.  A wonderful SUV yet it was not something I would ever get again unless diesel was offered.  Simply put, small engine pulling around a heavy car.  Out of all the cars I saw that day, I decided the A3 was the one.  Next day I leased a metallic grey pearl, open sky, premium package, and s-tronic automatic.  The 2.0 engine, I believe, coupled with a flawless DSG will allow this car to drive well beyond 100,000 miles.  The Open Sky, while novel, and great if rear passengers are present, is very hot in the summer.  ","engine + transmission=driving excellence.  Interior is excellently crafted, exterior is excellent as well.  The leather will maintain through the life of the car.  Utility is wonderful.  MPG-I get usually 23 in the city, 34 on highway.","Open Sky might warrant popped up roof strips, get them checked, mine damaged my hatch.  Absolutely buy better tires after 20,000 miles on those Pirellis.  No retrofit bluetooth is ridiculous, and if you live in warm weather ie above 91 like I do, the open sky will bake you alive.  Road noise is loud."
4.625,Tire noise destroys a good relationship,fbclt ,08/20/2009,,,5,5,5,4,,5,4,5,4,"I had read other reviews that indicated tire noise could be a problem, especially with the Pirelli P6 tires.  I thought I had escaped that fate as the first year was great; lot's of fun to drive, average 32.5 mpg overall, reasonably peppy and good brakes and handling.  After the 16,000 miles service and tire rotation the tire howl began.  I returned to Audi service who tell me that alignment and suspension are in spec and the tires are cupped which is causing the road noise.  The noise has only gotten worse. Plenty of tread left but unless the Pirelli tire dealer I see Saturday does something to adjust this, I will have to report to Audi and Pirelli that they have lost a customer for life.",,
4.125,Gets in its own way,big mountain ,05/15/2009,,,5,5,2,2,,5,4,5,5,"This is a great car if you like going to the dealer. Mechanically, it is perfect but the build quality is a disaster. Handles great, fast, average over 30 mpg in a mixed commute. Easy to park in the city. All of the doors have been taken apart for wiring harnesses being out of the clips. The radio was a mess. Seat belt receiver replaced, etc. Now I have 2 mystery rattles, the drivers door handle and an exhaust rattle. ","MPG, Looks, Sound of engine and sound system, panoramic roof, wheels. ","Build this car once, don't make your dealers rebuild it. If you are interested and see one on the lot with the Pirelli P6 tires, walk away. Belts split at 25k miles. New tires have made this car much better. "
3,Re-Review to BAD,Amylynn ,04/12/2009,,,4,5,1,1,,3,4,1,5,"I posted a review after I bought my Audi last August raving about it.  I now wish to retract my raves!  The ride and fun level are all great...but I am burning thru a quart of oil about every 1000 - 1500 miles!  I can't even make it to a regular oil change without the light coming on or me putting oil in it sometimes twice.  Terrible!  I am dumping this thing before it dies on me.  I drive 120 mile a day and can't risk being left on the side of the road, Audi care or not!  I am going back to a Honda or Toyota...loved both!  Too bad, such a beautiful car.","Handling, fun, styling","Engine, turbo needs work so it doesn't suck oil, premium fuel.  Poor amount of features for the price."
5,Great car,deg ,02/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is my forth Audi. I've had two 5000's an A6 quattro and now this 2008 A3 2.0T 6A. My wife drives it most of the time. We both love it. Have 11700 miles on it. No trouble at all. I highly recommend the ca.,Drive train and handling,2008 did not offer quattro with2.0T
5,I would buy it over and over again,Joseph Gutman ,12/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After the fuel crunch I decided to get rid of my Mercedes E-500 AMG.  I looked for fun, reliability, some luxury, good dealer service and a car that was practical. And I found all of it in the A3. Tried the 3.2 version and it ws not much better. I love driving and commuting on my A3. Nothing fails and if you go on-line you can find a few ""easter-eggs"" that Audi engineers left as a gift in hiding. It handles like a sports sedan and hums like a sprts car. It is just the perfect car for the person with a few bucks, without the need to be a show-off.","Style, comfort. performance and economy. I am 6'3"" tall and I have plenty of room.",I would love to see an extra D/C outlet close to the dash board.
3.25,Problems with Audi,Carlos Fernandez ,12/18/2008,,,4,4,1,1,,4,4,4,4,"With only 5,000 miles on my brand new A3, the power window is broken, the power seat for the driver is broken, and now the transmission is giving problems.  I will never buy another Audi again. This is the most problamatic car I have ever had, worst than the old Ford Explorer.  I am going to ask for a refund.  ",,"Needs new window motors, new power seat, and now new transmission with only 5,000 miles on the car"
5,"Fun, Practical, and Cool!",youngmc8 ,11/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Having driven my A3 for 7+ months now, I am very happy with this purchase. My previous car was a Subaru WRX, which made me consider what I would give up in performance with an A3. Well, now I realize that for 99% of my driving, the Audi provides more than what I need. (That 1% is pushing it beyond my comfort zone anyways.) The A3 gives you refined power and handling. It is a smart blend of style and practical considerations in a sports sedan. It has been a very responsive, comfortable, and rewarding driving experience. ",DSG transmission with shift paddles - you gotta try these!  ,"A solid, instead of mesh, inside sunroof cover for those hot sunny days."
5,Love the A3!,BobJ ,11/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my 7th Audi including A4s and a TT. I love this car! The 2.0 engine is a tremendous improvement over the old 1.8. The A3 is quick, has great handling, is nicely appointed and is a kick to drive. New car pricing is a bit hefty, but I bought mine at the end of the year and saved a lot. In '08, if you wanted AWD you had to buy the 3.2L engine, and the price got pretty high.  I understand that they are working on the pricing issue for '09.  My wife has an Acura MDX, but now she's borrowing the A3 whenever she can grab it.  ","Great handling, 2.0L engine, interior design.",Offer an affordable Quattro version with the 2.0L engine.
4.875,This is one bad little car,puroman ,11/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"First road trip with the car using sport shifting with the dsg and was completely gobsmacked by the performance of this car. Goes like stink, handles the curves like it's nobody's business and that transmisssion is without a doubt the best in the world and worth the extra cash. Throw the back seats down, throw the dog in, and off you go. Lots of room for two with luggage and that's all you need. Gas mileage is superb for a car with this performance. Too bad is has to be high test but you can't get everything. Ipod setup is easy but info on instrument panel could be a little more informational and clearer. But just go drive (faster if possible) you will love this car","DSG, performance, gas mileage, exterior styling especially the front",Wish the open sky opened a bit more.

4.875,"Excellent, Fun Car for the Money!",ASM ,09/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a great car, and I have had plenty to compare it to. I also own a Prius, which I kept, but I wanted a ""fun"" car, and I got that. I know everyone raves about the automatic, but frankly I love the stick shift. It is very responsive, and once you get use to the great distance the clutch goes in (I am only 5'4"") shifting is very smooth!  I have an hour drive to and from work everyday, and this has made it a pleasure!","Styling, manual shift, great pickup, the hatch back (I can fit tons in this car for its size), great sound system.","More features should come standard, rather than as ""options"", more storage, move the cupholders so large drinks don't inhibit the manual shift."
5,Sports Car plus ,philsoc8 ,08/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I wanted a sports coupe, but couldn't live without a backseat and some cargo space. The A3 completely fits the bill. Great engine; amazing transmission; handles like it's on rails.   Small size makes it tossable and zoom with an efficient engine, but the A3's real secret weapon is the practical space.  Audi doesn't want you to know this, but the back seat in the A3 is bigger than that in the A4. My kids love it!  True, it is not a bargain, if you price things on a per-inch basis, but if you value things because of how good they are, not just how big, you will love this car.","Transmission, engine, handling, drivers seat",More options should be standard.
5,Great Car!,Bzk ,07/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After owning several Audi vehicles, I can say that i'm a big Audi fan. So, when it was time to change my car again, I took to my local Audi dealer for my base model A3 with DSG. This car is great and I saved a good amount of money by not choosing many costly options. I'm pretty much happy with all standart equipment such as dual A/C, great stereo, excelent transmission, well designed and built interior and exterior.  If you want a Audi vehicle, beware of costly options. This car can go well over $30k with a few check marks on the option list.  Oh, did I mention how great the gas mileage is?",Exterior and Interior design and built quality. Great engine 2.0t and DSG transmission. Excelent stereo!,"Standart Ipod and/or usb connection.

Between them were BMW 328x & 335x, Acura RDX, BMW X3, Infiniti G35x and Lexus IS 250 AWD. Audi A3 overall had all the features that I wanted, AWD, cargo flexibility, compact size, powerful engine and a good level of luxury.  The A3 is impressive the way it handles. Coming from a previous S4 I was worried that the car wouldn't satisfy me but it has proved me wrong. I like this vehicle more and more as a continue to drive it. ",Smooth power and great transmission. The ride of the vehicle is sporty but not punishing. Flexibility of the cargo space. Size of the car is excellent since I live in NYC.,Xenon lights should be standard at this price. Paddle shifters shouldn't turn with the steering wheel. Fuel mileage could be a little better.

5,Nice compromise between GTI and BMW 3,Jay ,05/31/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My Audi A3 6MT is a blast to drive. It has mostly every feature I could ever want. It gets great mileage, is comfortable, fun, sexy.

I reviewed all the others in its class with extensive test drives for its competitors. The package is unmatched - performance, looks, build quality. This is the sexiest wagon on the road bar none.  Strong selling points were: Great gas mileage 26/31 (actual). Adaptive lighting - to be able to see that deer around the corner before you hit it.  DSG - Audi Innovation. Super smooth - six speed.

4.625,Why didn't I buy one sooner?,slushbox ,04/22/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,3,5,"Having been a BMW loyalist the last 8 years, buying a hatchback from Audi was a huge leap of faith.  It was, however, the best decision I could have made.  If you don't get silly with some of the options, this vehicle provides the optimum balance of performance, fuel economy, prestige, utility, and comfort.  There are plenty of other cars that do each of these better, but the whole of the A3 is greater than the sum of its parts.  Taking off ramps at 25+ MPH gives me the same giddiness as my last BMW did. It turns heads, and the interior is extremely well thought out. The trunk holds a lot of space, the mileage it gets is quite respectable, and it turns heads wherever I drive.","The crash test safety ratings, S-Line Package suspension, Open Sky system, and torque in 3rd gear.","More standard features, or more features added to Premium & S-Line packages."
4.875,1-Year Update on A3 2.0T DSG,jlesica ,03/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I'm nearing 1 year of ownership!  Haven't put on many miles (13k), but most were hard miles through Boston. Car was outstanding in the winter, traction control and stability performed very nicely. I was considering the Quattro when I bought it, but now I'm glad I didn't spend the extra 8k, it's not worth it. No mechanical problems to speak of.  I found out that a golf bag won't fit in the back without putting the seat down.  Maybe time to upgrade to an A4 Wagon? If only it had the A3 interior. Oh yea, and for those confused by the fact you can't tilt the windshield wipers up in the winter before a storm, turn the car off then hit the wiper lever, they come half way up!

4.75,Looking for comfortable seats?,Seattle ,03/19/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love this car.  Really fun to drive, sticks like glue to curves, great visibility, sporty but comfortable driving experience.

4.75,Perfect City Car; Compact Luxury.,Noah ,03/09/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"After years with an A4 Avant, this has not been a step down at all! I figured I would be sacrificing space and luxury for MPG and the convenience of a compact, but not really the case; roomy interior and meticulous detail (I could live without the carbon fiber trim look, however). Way easier to park in the city, better mileage, and far quicker than the A4. Overall, if you don't need the Quattro I can't see a reason to get a new A4 Avant when this option is out there.    ","DSG/S-tronic transmission w/paddles.  Modification options:  200hp is plenty, but it's nice to have the option to add a chip, exhaust, cold air intake, and bigger turbo when the car gets tired.

5,Refinement and Invigoration in One,JW ,03/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just purchased my A3, and after driving about town a bit now, I can say with certainty that this is a unique ride. Just like BMWs seem to combine refinement with performance, this car does the same, with a bit more raw feeling, less cush.  If you are even thinking about a BMW, or one of the many alternative, do not let the A3 slip your list, this car is great! It's like play toy that has all the creature comforts you could want.",Connection to the road and the car.

Pricing gets a little unfun with too many options, and many of those options are becoming standard with other makers."
3.25,Not worth the money,Mike ,03/01/2008,,,4,4,4,3,,3,3,2,3,"Needed a hatchback for our big dog. At least got that goal accomplished. Other than that: short gear ratios (2,500 rpm at 60mph) ruin the gas mileage. No fun at all on highway / interstate. What is the point putting the GTI gearbox (built for 16 year olds) in an Audi? Same audience? Car seems to have some kind of slope sensor. Transmission doesn't shift up when going up hill. Car runs uphill at 3,000 rpm and need shift manually i.o. to save gas. DSG transmission is nice but hypersensitive. It's a roller coaster ride when car is cold. A/C has a mind of it's own and takes a scientist to operate. Blower keeps changing speed. No homelink. No self-contained sun visor upgrade available. ",,Longer gear ratios for smooth riding and better gas mileage. Simplify a/c operation. Storage in rear doors. Homelink. Lower seat lips for easier entry. Provide cheaper replacement wipers. $100+ apiece is a (bad) joke. 
4.875,Quattro for life,Quattro rocks. ,02/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bullet fast. Sticks to the road like glue. Modern interior design. Awesome sound system. Torque and horsepower to spare. Quattro all wheel drive.  This car is worth every penny, and is truly a driver's car. The A3 3.2 is a total blast to drive. Spent the better part of 1 year comparing the A3 3.2 Quattro to the IS 250 AWD, Infiniti G35, Acura TL, and the BMW 325xi. The Audi is the thinking man's BMW, whatever that means.  Gas mileage not all that great, but nobody buys a 250 hp v6 for the gas mileage... you buy it for the big grin it puts on your face when you hammer the throttle.  I love this car, go buy one now!","3.2l engine + Quattro AWD = unmatched performance vs the competition.  Seats are really comfortable and sound system rocks.  Has MANY standard options (sirius, 6 disc changer w/ Bose premium system, rain sensing wipers, sun sensing headlights, autodimming mirrors, etc.).",Make xenon headlights and heated seats standard.
4.875,Buy this car now.,Quattro for life. ,01/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Great car. Driver's car. Not floaty like IS 250 or G35.  Very responsive, fast, engine has a very nice growl to it.  Quattro is unmatched, do the research.  3.2 liter engine + Quattro = 0-60 in 5.9 at least. Tons of great standard options such as autodimming mirrors, bose upgraded audio system, rain sensing wipers. I love this car. ",Quattro and 3.2 liter V6. Sound system is pretty awesome as well. ,Include xenons and heated seats as standard features.
5,Just bought this car and its a blast!,John and Janette ,12/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We came on the lot looking for an A4 and drove off with this one instead. The baseline A3 is pretty boring, but the S-Line is amazing! The Blue Sky package makes this car look very unique. Also got Sirius radio with the Bose audio package. The sound couldn't be any more clear. We'll follow-up if anything bad happens, but so far so awesome! If you go to Audi of Tysons Corner, make sure you ask for Ron! Very cool guy and extremely low intensity.","Bluesky package, Sirius with the Bose sound system, the brilliant red on this model looks fantastic, the red backlight for the controls is unique and more soothing than we thought it would be, and the S-Line package makes this car so fun to drive!",Nothing comes to mind at the moment.
4.75,Fun and Thrilling to Drive,jphsilon ,12/20/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"Just a little time with this car, but it has proven to be an excellent upgrade from my typical conservative Japanese sedan class of cars that I have driven for years.  Fun, sporty, economical (best gas mileage in the class) and the engine and transmission are amazing.  ","Driving experience.  The quick engine, transmission options, and nimble handling.","Better storage options in the dash area, with slightly more trunk room.  The Quattro in a 2.0 would have been a quick sell for me."
4.875,Great so far!,txbosoxfan ,08/09/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Had the car a little more than 3 weeks.  2.0T w/ S-Line.  Test drove the 3.2 but it felt too heavy with the 6 cyl. and quattro.  Plenty of kick in the 4 cyl.  The S Tronic shifters are responsive and addictive.,Driving experience and open sky system.  The iPod interface works flawlessly.,Technology needs updating.  Only car in its class that does not even offer homelink as an option.  No place to put sunglasses.
