4.625,Great First time car,cmede ,02/03/2015,,,5,3,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I bought this little guy used about 2 weeks ago. I came from a giant Nissan Altima all plush and built for long drives. I got into this Rondo and fell in love instantly! The seats were spacious for my bigger size, the leg room was great and the overall feel of the car felt like quality. I never thought I would buy something that looked like this. I think it's not the nicest to look at. It reminds me of a wagon. But the way it grips the corners, gets up to highway speeds and truly is a hoot to drive. I was worried the 4 Cylinders was going to be a problem on the highway. I was mistaken. For my first car that I bought. I recommend it to anyone. It really is quality with the low price.","The best part about this car is the heated seats, The ",I wish the back windows were tinted.

2.125,SO Disappointed,drivingmom2 ,03/09/2014,,,3,2,1,1,,3,4,1,2,"We bought our Rondo new in 2008. At the time it was exactly the car we were looking for, as it had the third row stow-and-go seats. We had reasonable performance from it for the first five years, although it did have a few factory recalls in that time. HOWEVER, two months after the five-year warranty expired, the engine failed. Despite the fact that I had followed the warranty maintenance schedule, KIA Canada would do nothing to assist us with this matter and we ended up having to have a second-hand motor installed. Apparently KIA create disposable cars and are not prepared to back their products. Like a previous poster, I too am a bit embarrassed about having recommended KIA to friends.

With the exception of so-so gas mileage, I though I'd scored an excellent deal. Then, in 2012, just after the 5-year warranty expired, I learned from my [very reliable] auto tech that the A/C compressor clutch had failed and would cost $2,000 to repair. This is a huge cash outlay for a relatively young vehicle w/ just over 45k. I'm embarrassed to tell anyone b/c I've been hyping the Rondo as a great value for four years. I won't be doing that any more.","Great functionality. I can haul all kinds of things around in the roomy interior. Lots of glass with great view and sightlines. Easy access for kids and oldsters.

I was also dissapointed when the break pads needed replacing at 30k miles. The dealer said it was because they they no longer use asbestos in the break pads. Now, with 56k miles, it feels like the pads need replacing again. I am use to getting at least 50-60k miles on break pads."

In July 2010 I got a 2008 with only 25,000 miles on it for $11,000.  Was thrilled.  The dealership was 2 1/2 hours away because I had a hard time finding a good one around where I live.  I love my Rondo.  While many say its nothing much to look at I like how it looks.  The performance is awesome.  I have taken it on two trips into the mountains and it doesn't hesitate.

I've driven it on the interstates, urban byways, country lanes, mountain roads, etc., and have no performance issues. No problems at all beyond the scheduled maintenance. It's well made, well equipped and is very functional--a terrific little multitasker at a bargain price.

The Rondo is easy to enter and exit, which is great for kids, the elderly and those with disabilities.

You can haul all kinds of stuff, great acceleration, and it is so comfortable it feels like you're driving while sitting on your favorite couch.  The car is an ugly bubble, don't get me wrong.

I even had enough room to layout in the back to sleep on the road.  I am comfortable driving it and my riders enjoy the extra room and cup holders.  It's like a boring friend.  It will do everything you ask of it but your hip friends don't like being seen with it.","The best feature of this vehicle is that it quietly does all the things you need it to do.  It can accelerate past semi trucks, move a couch, tailgate at the gate, and get you to work everyday.",A lot of people think it looks a little ugly but I would say that the Rondo really needs is to be a little shorter from end to end for better handling.

Dmall vibration when one rear window is lowered half way. Fit and finish are excellent. Arm rest could be a about four inches longer.

We were replacing our 98 Ford Windstar, we wanted better gas mileage, but still versatility.  So we rented this vehicle for the weekend, highly recommended.

Purchase process, we talked to the car sales arm of the rental agency, said we wanted dark as possible interior and 7 seater, they brought in a Silver exterior, with black interior.  Ultimately we purchased it for $13,000 with 7,000 miles on it and we have gotten 21.8mpg strictly in town driving, that is what we expected.","Sportmatic shift (fun), 7 passenger, Handling, Electronic Stability Control (standard) Storage, price, Power, Excellent 2 row leg room (I'm 6'1"" and I have plenty of room) Reclining seats.

I later noticed that when I drove it o the freeway I have to steer more to the left to keep from FLOATING into the other lane. I just figured it was all of a sudden very windy outside. But of course it wasnt. The storage in the back I'm not too fond of. I can hear everything sliding back n forth. Did I mention I hate the way the outside looks.

2.75,Extremely Disappointed,James Appling ,02/26/2009,,,4,2,2,3,,3,4,2,2,"I now believe I made a mistake buying this vehicle. I thought it was going to be a great investment. Not so. The gas mileage is poor and there is this extremely annoying wind noise on the drivers side. based on other commentary, it would seem that it can not be fixed. Yeah, the vehicle does not look great but we bought it for the features and the price. We are very disappointed and are looking at our options of getting something else. It does not handle particularly well on the road. It has a tendency to float and I can almost see the gas gage move. Like one other guy said, I guess you get what you pay for.",We were impressed by the safety features and the roominess. The acceleration is not bad for the price and does have a lot of extra features that you pay an arm and leg for with other vehicles.,"Better gas mileage, improved handling, body styling and eliminate the window noise on the driver's side."

The test drive took place in city traffic where I didn't see some of the flaws. On the long drive home there was a very annoying sound at the driver's window (air coming in). The car is very ""floaty"" & seems too wishy washy on the road. I don't feel in command of my vehicle. The 4 cylinder engine whines so loud, like it may explode before we really get rolling. I am thinking of taking it back in the morning & getting my money back. This is a cheap car & I don't feel safe in it. ",I got a very good price on the car but I guess I should have remembered you get what you pay for. I sure didn't get much a solid car. ,"Kia should stop this annoying wind whistling window right in the driver's ear. Make car feel more stable on the road, not float all over.

To be honest I was ready to purchase a Mazda5 but decided to stop in at Kia one day and got a deal that is hard to beat and purchased the vehicle for a good amount less than I could get the Mazda. Styling is bland compared to the Mazda5 but it does seat 7 instead of 6 (although very tight) and has ESC which the Mazda didn't, among many other good safety features. The vehicle gets good gas mileage, handles well and has decent power with the V6, and the price was right for us.","Safety features, interior fit and finish, excellent versatility for a smaller vehicle (with 2 kids and a dog, and the occasional extra passenger or two the folding 3rd row comes in handy), handling, V6 has enough power yet good on gas.

Not that is a bad thing, it is not as attractive as other vehicles in this size, but the price was right. Also the 3rd row is what my family needed.  Overall it drives nice and there is plenty of room in both front and second row.  The 3rd row is for children, but how many adults ride in a 3rd row?  There is virtually no room if the 3rd row is up.  As most vehicles in this size there is not room with a 3rd row.  The fold down of the 2nd and 3rd row is nice and has plenty of room if needed for storage with this feature.

I sought a vehicle that was a good value, had a practical aspect for light duty hauling, and that would be reliable with decent gas mileage.  I have been happy with the Rondo and it has mostly met the above criteria.  Bonus features that I found are that the V6 has good pickup and handles around corners well. Also I am 6'5'' and about 210 lbs. This car provides excellent headroom and decent leg room.  I like that the driver sits up fairly high with good visibility too.  Overall, there are better vehicles in this category I'd say, but they will cost you significantly more.  This is a reliable vehicle at a good price I believe.",V6 has good pickup. Manual shift option is easy and provides extra pickup when needed. Good room for tall guy 6'5''. Hatchback has better room than   competitors in back without having seat folded (with 5 seater).

Aside from this issue we have been happy with the vehicle.  ,We enjoy that we can fit our whole family in it with out having a minivan,"The air leak is of huge concern, particularly because they cannot say what is causing it and it is in all 2008 models.

The performance of the 4-cylinder never fails to impress me (it outperforms the 2.8L V6 on my previous vehicle) and provides great economy and very smooth shifts.
