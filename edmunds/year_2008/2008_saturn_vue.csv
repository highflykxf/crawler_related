It's been reliable and has never failed me 3 years later. I don't think I could trade this car because it has been good to me. My family loves it and my grandfather that owns many muscle cars and worked at a car dealership said it's a nice little vehicle. I live in Indiana so we get a lot of snow and this little car only being front wheel drive had done great, haven't gotten it stuck once. We drove through a foot of snow in it and it did very well, obviously you have to be cautious and make good choices with driving a two wheel drive in the snow but we did it.  The car has great speakers, but I ended up getting a touch screen installed because I wanted to use the Bluetooth and not have to pay I star to talk through the car when I got a call. I do recommend getting a new radio installed because it looks great but the factory radio works very well also.

I have been proactive in maintaining the car.  Tuneups were done before required.  Same with brakes.  I used synthetic oil during the entire time I've had it.

The only unexpected repairs were:
1.  Radiator (at 215K)
2.  Transmission (at 245K)
3.  Starter (at 247K)

I just put the car up for sale, but I have to say that I've read some bad reviews for this SUV, and I can only think that those people who've complained about it didn't take care of their cars.  Too bad, it's a great car, as far as I'm concerned.","Solid ride (no rattles), decent standard sound system","Now that it's no longer a Saturn Vue (it's a Chevy Captiva)I would suggest adding a little more leg room.  I've average sized (6' tall), and I have to say that I felt a little cramped at times."
4.875,Most Reliable SUV I've Owned!,rdsteve23 ,05/24/2015,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this SUV for my family vehicle for my wife to drive with our 2 kids. We take it on trips out of town, and she drives it around town. We both love it. We bought it brand new almost 7 years ago, and have had no problems. It gets decent gas milage while also giving ample power, especially for a 4 cylinder. It drives smooth and has plenty of room for our family of 4, plus sometimes we throw our big german shepherd in the back too. The exterior looks great and has held up well, as well as the interior (looks very upscale). It is very comfortable to drive, handles very well, and doesn't have a lot of road noise either. I am very impressed with Saturn, it's just too bad they went under...","I like that Saturn thought of a few things about the vehicle when they made it. For instance, the driver side window has extra power than the other windows, I think due to the fact that they know this one wears out first on vehicles. Also the drivers seat feels very comfortable with lumbar support, as well as the center console arm that extends to give you a good feel while driving. It has traction control, and disc brakes for all 4 wheels so your in maximum control (most vehicles only have 2 discs and 2 drums). The back of the front seats also have hard plastic guarding with a storage net to protect the back seat from kicking kids, and has storage areas through out the SUV. ","The cup holders in the front seats are not very good, and the center console is a bit small, so I gave it a 4 star interior rating instead of 5. Also you can only lock/unlock the doors from the drivers seat, which can be annoying if the front passenger wants to lock/unlock from inside. Other than those minor things, this SUV rocks!"

4.875,Had it 1 day...feel like we struck gold (so far),zionadams ,02/22/2013,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I test drove a lot of cars, over about a one year period. I took them on freeways, up hills, even off-roading in one instance. This car was the winner.We bought an XE with 62k miles on it,that's got all the options of an XR with the smaller2.4 motor. My sports car freak husband, who is 6'7"" tall, loves it. We are not small people but this car fits our frames fine. Our needs for a good value combined with a solid feel were met, we hope, in the VE. The mileage estimates are 25/30. On the freeway, it does 85 without hesitation. No vibration, no lag in shifting. The engine is quiet, but not just because it's small. It's just a quiet vehicle, even the air system is quiet when blowing.","The leg room and head room are ample, lengthwise. I like to lean my legs to the side (I'm 5'6"" tall) and I wish it were a little wider but that's true for all but the fullest size SUV's I test drove. Overall, the dimensions of the cab will comfortably fit fluffy chicks and tall guys alike. The ergonomically designed dash is what sold me on the interior. Classic styling will appeal to grown ups; this car is sold as the Opel SUV in Europe. The full front/back leather seats are beautiful. Doors are trimmed in leather. The multi-compartment center console is nice. No big blind spots so far. Very comparable to the Jeep Compass, with a slightly shorter bed. Feels more Euro than Asian. ","So far, I'd say there aren't a lot of improvements I'd suggest. I was picky and this car checked all my boxes. It's comparable in quality to a high end Chrysler or the tricked out Kia SUV. If I could reposition the center console, I'd move it forward 6"", so that my forearm were better rested, but pushing the seat back solves the issue.
I do wish there'd been a larger concealed area under the trunk/tailgate area. There's 2 binnies large enough to keep dog toys or even work boots, around the spare tire edges. But, not large enough to hide an overnight bag. This feels like a woman's car but guys will enjoy it too. Now, let's just hope the motor holds up...I'll be back! "

Until last week while I was driving home and the RPM's started reving up and going back down and then the transmission felt like it wasn't engaged and I was stranded alongside the road side waiting for a tow truck.

On cold mornings the car will not start correctly; it ""searches"" for an idle speed which it can't find. It will not accelerate until it is warmed up. The dealer and Saturn engineers cannot find the problem. It is 33 days in the shop and remains there. They keep throwing more new parts at it, but the problem persists.

I also was involved with the recent recall. It was also fixed and had my oil changed at the same time. I really do love my VUE, highly recommend it, and have been stopped numerous times in parking lots to answer questions about it.

I'm not a professional hyper-miler by any means, but I am able to coax out 30 MPG on my daily drive to work and back.

I come out of the house and it's frozen. They had to replace the heater core. It has never sounded or driven the same since it came back. Also, the windshield wiper fluid leaked because they made the reservoir and neck two pieces and they had to replace pieces there as well. About a month after I got it there was a recall to reset the computer because apparently some had lights staying on too long draining the battery.

Interior well thought out, very European, which I like.  Buying experience was good. Disappointed with gas mileage, but I suppose it is good for a small SUV that carries that kind of weight.

The good news on the 4 cylinder is you can average 26 mpg or more if you keep it 70 mph or less on the highway. Any hill will cause a downshift and jump in RPMs. The downshift is usually smooth except in the hills. Front seats seem short and drivers foot rest uncomfortable. Ride and handling are very good for the style of vehicle. A fuel efficient V-6 mated to a 5-speed auto would be perfect.

We have had our vue in 8 or 9 times to the dealer. Parts have been replaced and wire harnesess spliced. We requested a buy back from GM. My wifes father worked for GM for 35 years. The bottom line is they told us too bad. Offered extended warrenty only. The dealer would not even work with us on a trade in. Offered 21000 for trade on a 30000 vue with 3000 miles.

I'm not an impulse buyer, so I did extensive research after my test drive. Bottom line: IMO the '08 Vue is the best suv on the world market for the money.

4.875,A wonderful surprise.,Terry Swiers ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We had originally test drove the Vue to eliminate it from our list of vehicle options, just so we could say that we had actually looked at all of our options within the price range we set for ourselves. But instead of eliminating it, it moved to the top of the list. Of the vehicles that we looked at, the Vue Red Line was the only one that we walked away from the test drive with that ""gotta have it"" feeling. It had all the power we wanted, looked great, a smooth quiet ride, and it drove like it was on rails. If you are looking for a sporty compact SUV, don't dismiss the Vue Red Line until you have actually driven it. ",Seat warmers that go all the way up the back. The advanced audio is just killer.

But one day we had to rent a car and we got the 2008 Vue. I was sold. When I went to the dealership they had the Black Onyx Red Line. This car is sporty upon spory.  Right down to its red trimmed leather and suede seats. I have received so many compliments about this car but the outside is only half the story.  It is fun to drive and it has great saftey features. Especially the OnStar. It has a quiet interior ride with loads of storage space. Includeing the one under the passenger seat.

Dealer was great to work with and we have no complaints about the vehicle so far.  A 6 cylinder would have been in the running when we bought if the mileage had been a bit better.  However, so far, the 4 Cyl has done well in both city driving and on the highway.  This is not the engine if you want to run at 200km/hr, however, if you drive properly and are not trying to win any land-speed records, this is the vehicle/engine for you!  We looked at the CRV, RAV4 and CX-7 and this was definitely the best-buy of them all!

Never buying a GMC product before I wasn't expecting too much when we took a new V6 fwd for a demo.  Its' handling and ride on both local and interstate roads was so impressive especially for such a small suv I immediately began seriously considering it.

Anyone else having this problem?  I am beginning to think mine was a 30 day return as it had 300 miles on it and I was denied the 30 exchange policy because they gave me extra inncentives which was not disclosed to me, as at purchase they kept reminding me I had 30 days, well not when trying to exchange!

The car accelerates and handles fine, but on the highway it plays the little engine that could every 30 seconds.  It can't handle any sort of incline & in the mountains its so bad that I have sought a trade in.  And the gas mileage trade off is not stellar: I only get 22MPG.  also don't buy with out factory installed roof rails.  Without them you can't get an ofter market system.  Period.

This is the new design and body style based on a GM European design. Finally, GM gets it right.  This looks and feels like a luxury vehicle.  The steering wheels, console and doors are very modern.

As others, I researched the Honda CRV, Toyota RAV, and even the Nissan Rogue.  This vehicle is much more stylish then the Honda, and the price is way better than the RAV.  The Nissan Rogue had too bad of a blind spot. The Saturn has it all, looks, style, comfort, room, and the gas mileage is not too too bad.  I bought the 4 cylinder and it gets me where I need to go in ample time. If I want to pass someone, I can pass someone with ease.  You will love how the Saturn holds the road.

Only have 3000 miles on it but have nothing but praise for performance and quality. First US made car in many years. The VUE brought me back. Did 2000 mile trip in first 2 weeks and it was flawless. GM can compete if they keep the mentality they put into the VUE. Stopped by dealership on a lark and owned the car in one day. 4 cylinder just didn't make it, but 6 is a dream.

4.25,Impressive,underdog ,01/02/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,5,3,3,5,"I was not planning on purchasing a Vue. After seeing the quality and test driving it, I was very impressed. I didn't care for the gas mileage, but figured it was a trade off for the AWD and power for Maine driving. I opted out of the original Vue with the 4- cylinder engine. Please take the lack of power into consideration when making your final decision. But, true to their word, Saturn took my 4-cyl. back and put me in to a 6 cyl AWD. What a difference in vehicles.  Overall, the Vue has been a pleasant vehicle for me to drive. I use this vehicle for business and drive it every day. When you drive past an older Vue, you'll be proud of how far along they've come.","My favorite features would have to start with the AWD. I have never had an AWD vehicle and I am very inpressed. Secondly is the built in XM option and OnStar. I never thought audio / safety options would be ""as"" important as they are. I can't forget the interior and exterior design.  Much improved.","The seats could use a bit of firming up. Also, the position of the steering wheel ""interior posts"" (the horn) seem to make my left wrist hurt. It may be just the positioning of my hand on the wheel, but I seem to constantly ""fight"" with the wheel.  Maybe the interior design of the wheel can change"
3.875,After One Month,Keith ,01/01/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,2,4,"Not much experience yet but this gives insight into why we chose the VUE and our early impressions. My wife and I test drove the Outlander, Rav4, XL7, Vitara, Tuscon, Santa Fe, CR-V, CX-7, and two Kia models before choosing the VUE. The VUE felt more powerful and tracked and handled better. It felt more subtantial. The car simply feels different from the others which might be the European engineering (this is an Opel with a GM motor and rebadged as a Saturn). The interior materials and details are superior to others at this price. Acceleration is quick and effortless,the 6 speed trans is smooth,the ride quiet and smooth. Too soon to rate reliability but no problems to date.","Exterior and interior design and detail. Acceleration, handling, and 6 speed transmission. Heated leather seats and remote start. XM radio and OnStar are nice value added features. Turn by Turn navigation works well - you don't need to spend 2K for the navigation option. ","The center console feels flimsy when you lean your elbow on it and after pulling it forward, it slowly migrates back to it's former position requiring you to move it forward again.

Waited until the Red Line's started showing-up and decided this was the one for me. Put down a little more to reduce the monthly- payment.  Mine's Polar White, with the Ebony interior. Looks good, feels good to sit-in, and best of all it's a hoot to drive so far.

Would like to see the older body style rear-end, the new style has less room inside.  Miss those polymer side body panels.  Would like to see the temperature and compass on the mirror again.  "

We picked one out with 4 miles on it and the A/C broke after 12 miles of driving away from the dealership. We used the 30 day option and replaced the vehicle with an exact copy but it had a paint bubble on the shifter trim ring. Dealership fixed the issue and my wife is happy. No other issues to report after 200 miles.  We are happy with our decision to purchase an 08 VUE XR over an 07 RAV4 Sport, we test drove both on the same day.

Overall very satisfied with the vehicle.,Interior finish is nicer than most competitors (i.e Compass).  OnStar has some great features - the check engine light came on an OnStar was able to get the code and contact the dealer with the problem (loose connector) while I was driving.,Built in a converter do you can direct plug in a laptop or cell charger.
5,This Vue is impressive,Rudge ,09/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The 08 Vue with the 3.6 V-6 is awesome. It is smooth and powerful. A TRD Tundra was no match last week for this barn burner. The interior controls are perfectly laid out and of supreme quality.  People really like its looks. Car has over 5000 miles so far with no issues.

5,Very happy owner,mulebrand ,09/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Buying from Saturn was a pleasure. I drove several other import sedans as well as small SUVs before buying the Saturn. We got one with most of the extra's and don't regret it. The 3.6 V6 is quick (zippy) and quiet. The vehicle looks and feels high quality. I'm hooked on the standard satellite radio and the great sound system. Roomy enough for four adults (or three adults and our other daughter the lab). Front seat cushion a little short for tall folks, but still comfortable enough. The cargo net and divider for the cargo area are really handy and easy to use.","Zippy handling, quiet ride, great radio. Couldn't be happier. The built in cell phone is easy to use.",A little deeper seat cushion. A little bigger fuel tank.
4.75,Our 6th Saturn,Pat ,09/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This is our sixth Saturn, our third Vue. We have only had it a week, but during that time we drove it from central California to southern Arizona. This Vue is superior to our previous Vues because of the V6 engine, increased stability, OnStar, European styling and increased comfort. It's a smooth, fun car to drive. The fuel economy is not as good as our last Vue, but that's because we went to the V6 engine. It's worth it. The 4cyl we had on the last Vue just didn't have the pickup you need to pass and get up the hills with ease. My husband loves having the radio controls on the steering wheel and satellite radio. We also love the Saturn service. (I just wish they'd had a red one.)","V-6 engine, great looks, comfort, power driver's seat, Saturn service, but most of all, the stability of the AWD.",I'd like the sliding center arm rest to lock in the forward position. I liked having the temp & direction on the mirror so the passanger could see it. Better fuel economy.
3.25,Not 100%,Not 100% the best ,08/30/2007,,,5,5,3,3,,1,4,4,1,"The exterior is awesome!  The interior looks fantastic and is very functional.  However, I am on my second one....I used Saturn's 30 day return policy.  The first one had huge transmission issues and shipping damage I found after delivery.  THe dealership stepped right up and provided an exchange, no questions asked.  My second one seems fine, just don't expect to step on the gas and go anywhere quick.  The transmission is also extremely sluggish.  If you can afford the v6, this would be a fantastic SUV.  But if you're like me, you have to live with the 4cyl.",The styling is fantastic.  The features are over the top awesome...much more than any other competitor.,"Please buy the v6.  I am not a speed racer, but the engine can't even maintain speed on a slight incline w/o stepping on the gas and downshifting.  I'd like to talk to a GM engineer about what a bad idea the 4-speed transmission is.....but in the end, the dealers are awesome, honest (pure price)."
5,Best SUV for t he price!,Saturnman ,08/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is Saturn #3 for me. A '95 S series then a 2006 Vue, but the 2008 Saturn Vue is by far the finest compact SUV for the price.

4.25,Saturn matches the competion,SomeGuy ,08/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,3,3,I recently drove the 4cyl CRV and RAV- 4. This vehicle had better performance than either of the two. Steering is a little mushy but not overly so. Could use a little more size overall.  I was unsure about the fuel economy because the CRV and RAV-4's were higher. Then I was informed that The Honda and Toyota rivals were on the old epa rating system.

The Vue offers much more for your money. Saturn did a great job on redesigning this model.  Looks and drives like a luxury car.  More bells and whistles.  Saturn customer service is amazing.  My experience was stress free. I would have never thought of Saturn before.  No one can believe it is a Saturn. Check it out...great buy!",Radio with the ability to program 36 channels.

I have been waiting for the '08 VUE just to check it out, but didn't have high expectations. I saw an XE 6Cyl sitting in the grass of a local Saturn store on my way to a Honda dealership and decided to walk in and ask to take it for a spin. First time inside the cabin and I was really impressed with the quality of the materials and the seats were super comfy and supportive. It had standard XM satellite and one year free OnStar which was a plus. I drove it on back road and the freeway and was blown away. No windrush and the ride and handling had european characteristics. I was sold! ",Ride. Seat comfort. I have XR with leather and even that's comfy. Cool cargo net in back.

5,Best Car Ever,I Love this car!!! ,08/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is my second Saturn and I love the Vue. The new '08 shape is great. The drive is very smooth and until someone comes with something better (which I doubt) I will continue to purchase the Saturn Vue's.

4.75,"So Far, So Good",Steve K. ,08/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Overall, my experience with my new Vue is very positive. Although, I very seldom make a major purchase on impulse, this car was an exception. As soon as I saw it on the lot, I knew I had to have it. Over the last year or two, whenever a saw one of GMs foreign competitors crossover vehicles, I would think if GM (Im a GM retiree) would make something like that I would buy it.

4,Not a Happy Camper,Lake Dude ,08/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,2,4,4,2,"I bought a Saturn xe 4cyl, Power is not enough for a 3800 # car. Electric P/S gets harder to turn the faster you go, At 70mph a small correction requires quite a wheel movment and that makes you wander from side to side .(Not fun to drive at 60+) Cruise shifts down at a slight grade so much so that i can't stand it and don't use it. The 4 speed whines in 2nd and 3rd before in shifts. I pulled a very very small lown mower trailer got so tired of the whine i used the manual shift button. Up side 22+ mph overall,Looks good in side and out rides firm but nice.  Give the 4cyl a good test ride at 65mph+ 1/2 and you can see what I mean. Then buy the 6cyl, it has regular P/S and cruise works.     ",Overall quality. Seats fit me,"Drop electric P/S and use the regular P/S. Drop the 4 speed and put the 6 speed on the 4cyl. Would make it a great car, or just get the 6 cyl . Don't want to sound like sour grapes but thats how I feel."

Upon going to the dealership, my fiancee and I took a test drive and we were sold. The vehicle looks much like a higher-class SUV rather than the cheaper 2007 model. The drive is great, comfortable, and extremely enjoyable.  I've been pleasantly surprised by the drive and quality of this car, and everywhere you look, there's something new you discover about it. I'd easily recommend this to friends and family.","Heated cloth seats, design is superb, solid SUV.","A little more cargo room perhaps, maybe a change in where the side-view mirrors are anchored."

(I have had 04,06 and now 08)It has been a very reliable vehicle though without much pizazz until now, the 2008 has really captivated my attention.  The interior and exterior are beautiful its very quiet and is very exciting to drive.  My other Vues were nice but not stylish. The 08' has more than enough horsepower to leave most vehicle in the dust which is not usual for a small SUV. Definitely worth checking out.  the Vue has been very reliable I expect the same from this new version.  ","The seats are wonderful, my last ones' seats were not comfortable, the fit and finish of the interior and exterior. HVAC controls is far superior.  Back seat also reclines a little to give passengers more room. Also the AWD and Stability control are so helpful cant what for snow!","there are two improvements to the IP its  a little to dark ""I like the old display better"". The speedometer also needs tick marks at the 5's. I miss the arm rest from the last one.  Gas mileage also could be a little better, but I do have a bigger engine this time."

Lots of interior features, my kids love the reclining rear seats. Plenty of leg room for adults. All seats fold down flat of cource. Safety features like OnStar for one year, side impact air bags,came standard. I had roof rails and trailering package added as options for about $500 extra. It has 1500lb towing capacity which is sufficent for my 14' aluminum fishing boat.

4.75,Fresh off the Truck,Robert ,07/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"Great look and feel. The only, I mean only, flaw is the 4 cycle engine.  I get great gas mileage but I would sacrafice a few MPG for some more power. I struggles to maintain 70-80 mile per hour on the interstate - the smallest hills, even overpasses, cause a 4-8 mph drop in speed which causes a downshift.  Even if you give it a little more gas it won't help, the 4 cycle VUE has to shift down to get back to the cruising speed. If you are not concerned with power and would rather MPG then stick with the XE but if you need power then spend the extra and upgrade to the XR.  But definitely get a 2008 Saturn VUE. Excellent vehicle.",Style of the VUE is awesome. I catch people staring at it all the time.  The mileage is also very appealing.,Supercharge the 4 cylinder XE VUE - would still get good gas mileage but would get more horsepower and torque.  
3.875,A new VUE,stu ,07/04/2007,,,4,5,4,4,,3,4,3,4,I went to the dealer expecting to buy a 2007 hybrid VUE. The hybrid had electrical problems so I tried on an '08 base VUE for size. The '08 had a superior ride to not only the '07 but every other small SUV I had tried. I bought a 4 cyl so the performance is sluggish but it still has get up and go when you really need it. Steering and agility is great for a vehicle of it's size. Most of all it's styling seems to be a decade ahead of the '07. The gas mileage could be better but keep in mind that it's 08 EPA numbers won't look so bad when we see all the other SUV '08 numbers. All in all the 2008 VUE is very nice ride for an SUV.,"Exterior styling. Base comes with standard 6 airbags, XM radio and OnStar. Cargo net system in storage area",A little sluggish from its particular gearing and perhaps its weight. Wish the hybrid was available in the '08 right now
5,Pleasantly suprised,toyotanut ,06/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I feel like I am driving a Lexus. Finally a 4 cylinder SUV with some kick and good gas mileage. If you convert the EPA to last years standards it gets 22 MPG city and 29 MPG highway.  Not bad considering the power.,Lexus quality drive and look.,I got mine without the spoiler and now and am regreting it everytime I see one on the road.
