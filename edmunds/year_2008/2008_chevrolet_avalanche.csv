It was listed for almost 43K and I paid about 28K with all rebates and my fathers GM discount.  Not bad.   I can tell you knock on wood that I have not had any issues at all just the regular maintenance.    I am a firm believer in how you drive and take care of your car is how you get paid in return.  I always bought new vehicles and I have always owned them for at least 10 yrs or more.   I do want to see If I can least put 400,00 on it before major issues turn up.    It still looks show room and I do spiff it up with 20 in chrome wheels in the summer and I have a chrome hood shield in front.   If some is interested in a used one.  I would recommend but research the history before buying.  It is just like anything else.",,

Dash cracked around 50k - JB plastic weld and vinyl repair patterning fixed that.

The Avalanche has a better interior and a better ride (not as stiff). The utility is also better as the seats can be folded or the cover stored. It may not be as fast as the Tundra, but if you are doing hwy miles, you should get this. I traded in a 1998 Toyota.  I'm impressed. No problems yet. I also like the oil filter/drain set- up.

I can see how backing up could be a problem, but if you get the LTZ model, it has the camera and assist lights which really helps with that. Other than that, I think this truck is perfect."
5,Number 3,NFRich ,06/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my 3rd Avalanche. Have had an 02 and 04. Bought an 07 Silverado and didn't like that at all. Only had around 9000 miles when I got rid of it. The Silverado got the worse gas mileage I have ever gotten with one, and have had them for years. So, was able to go back to the truck I love.  It is so versitle. Can fit sheets of plywood and drywall in without issues at all. The storage areas are great as well. There is so much room that everyone can travel in comfort. Drove straight through to FL one year and put a futon mattress in the back/folded the seat down and the kids had all the room they needed along with all the luggage. Has to be the best product GM has come out with!",Just about everything!,Put the step assisted back into the back bumper
4.875,LTZ is the best vehicle I've ever owned,Michael ,06/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have always been a Ford fan, and still have nothing bad to say, but this is the best vehicle I have ever owned. I love this truck. I looked at the F-150, Tundra and even the MB GL, but I was drawn back to this truck every time. It's functional, practical, has a very roomy and comfortable back seat, the plactic bed cover is more durable than the steel ones I have seen. I own a BMW and this truck's interior fit and finish is just as luxurious as my BMW's is. I have never been happier with a purchase, I'm averaging 15 MPG, not great, but not bad for a pickup. I had a lot of people point me towards the Tundra, I would not do an even swap if you paid me $10k more. I'm a bowtie guy now!","Locking side storage bins on the bed, locking tailgate, ease of converting to a full bed, back up camera, rear entertaiment system allows you to watch movies in the front when truck is in park, remote start keeps temp at 72 in winter and summer, side airbags, mesh grille, auto sunroof, takes E85 fuel","Flip down entertainment screens block the rearview, would have preferred the screens in the headrests.

4.875,Love my Avalanche!,shancock ,05/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I bought a new LT Avalanche in 2006 and just now traded it in to a 2008. We just wanted the new design. We had no problems at all with our 2006. I love the way they drive and handle. I wish I had paid the difference and got the LTZ package. I love everything about it and hope this one is as good as my 2006.,"Remote start, side air bags, back-up assist, leather seats, XM radio, sunroof",
4.875,Best truck yet!,jplrad ,04/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I traded in my 2001 GMC Sierra 1500HD 4WD for this vehicle and I am very impressed. Chevy really did there homework.  I got the 6.0L 4WD LTZ w/chrome pkg. (ie. loaded).  It drives like a sedan with no problem getting into regular parking spaces.  There was no way I could take my old truck where parking was a concern. It is quiet but with plenty of power. Extremely comfortable with a silky smooth ride. Midgate and side coolers are very functional. I did not have to buy an additional bedliner and fiberglass cap. No problem putting tall things in the back. This ride is smoother than my Corvette and much more refined than any other truck out there!  ,"NAV, XM, DVD, remote start, car-like ride, rear-view camera, 20"" chrome wheels, midgate, brute force power but a dream to drive!",Can't have front mudflaps with power steps. Small glove box. No CD holder in console. No extra storage for wireless headphones. Duramax diesel w/Allison transmission. Better gas mileage. Push button start like the Corvette.
4.875,I love this truck,shelsm ,04/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The price tag was expensive, but it was well worth it. I got the chrome edition with 22"" wheels. I love it! It drives like a car, but has the benefits of a truck. I recommend it a 100 times over. The fuel management system does save me a little gas too. ",,
4.75,08 LTZ in Kansas City,Kansas CIty 08 LTZ ,04/01/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I traded in my 07 Trailblazer SS for this vehicle. It rides far better and while it does not have the blazing fast speed of the SS, it does very well for a big truck and gets a lot better fuel economy than the SS did with it's LS2 Corvette motor. Still Adjusting the the size of it vs. the TrailBlazer, but overall am very happy with it. Got a great deal--almost 10,000 of the sticker and 0% financing to boot.  I believe that I will be very happy with this vehicle.","LTZ package, rear back-up camera, Bose stereo, navagation system, excellent ride for a ""truck""","5 speed or better transmission would help mpg's, standard dual exhaust on a truck at this level"
4.875,2008 Chevrolet Avalanche LT3 Crew Cab SB,James Jackson ,03/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded a 2007 Nissan Titan Crew Cab LE in on this vehicle, hands down this is a far better vehicle. It's rides and handle better than the F-150s I have own, and for me to say this about a Chevy, this is really saying something. What else can I say a great vehicle with great flexability.","Midgate, OnStar and the ability to use it like a truck.",Wind noise
4.75,North Carolina LTZ Avalanche 2008,avyowner2008LTZ ,03/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I thought long and hard before buying this vehicle.  I compared it to the Cadillac EXT, Toyota Tundra Ltd, Ford F-150 King Ranch, Dodge TD, GMC 2500 Duramax TD w/ Allison6spd.  In the end, all those other vehicles were just trucks. If what you really want is a truck, then buy the GMC or the Tundra, in my opinion. If what you want is really a very nice SUV with lots of bells & whistles that also doubles as a pickup truck, then the Avalanche is for you as it was for me.   I have every toy you can get on this LTZ and I suggest you either get the LTZ or the LT3 w/Z71.  No LTZ ride leveling on the LT3 though.  No 4x4 in the Caddy available.","Midgate: no one else has this in a full-size pickup except the Cadillac EXT, which is the Avalanche LTZ w/ a slightly different body, no 4x4 & $10k more. Generous front cabin, big covered rear bed, smooth handling, spacious tool compartments, OnStar! they e-mail reports! Elec folding mirrors.","Larger glove box; the owner's manual won't fit. Optional console dividers. Quieter engine. 6 speed Allison auto transmission. Better mileage. Optional diesel. More rear knee room. Place for rear headphones. Console shift intead of on the steering column. Elec. rear window, easier tire replacement."

4.875,2008 Chevrolet Avalanche LTZ 4x4 5.3L,TW ,01/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded a 2003 Chevrolet Avalanche for this 2008.  I put 52,000 miles on my 2003 and only had to change the tires and one light bulb.  The vehicle is great and I couldn't be more satisified with the new one.  I was concerned about the low height of the front valance, but so far it has not been a problem.  Also, I went from cloth seats to leather and was concerned about the change.  However, I can't be happier especially when I turn on the heated seats in cold weather.","Auto ride suspension, versatility, comfort of heated leather seats. Gas mileage has increased to 17.5 over my old one of 15.5.  ",Bring back the 2nd light on the passenger side in the bed.
5,Great Truck,capt ,12/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded my 04 TrailBlazer EXT for a 2008 Z71. It has much better gas mileage. Every feature you could ask for, comfortable ride. Looks great. Added some accesories, wind visors and bug guard. Plenty of leg room in front and back. ","Interior design, all controls are easy to access. Storage compartment in center is huge.",Chevy should come out with a removable bed cap. Snugtop has one but it permanently mounts.

The LTZ has everything you could want. Incredible interior with leather and lots of room. The exterior has a great design and love the custom grill and 20"" wheels. The unique design as far as the way the back bed folds down and the back window come out is really an engineering marvel. get lots of looks in this truck, the black with the chrome accents really sets this truck apart. Can not wait to add some custom features I have already found. I was able to negotiate a great deal as well and GM is offering some really great incentives. 50 mile 5 year warranty wow","Warranty, classy exterior design, gorgeous interior, backup camera and sensor, crash rating, comfortable and roomy both up front and in the rear. Love the way you can drive around with the rear window out if you want. Lots of storage and the bed is actually over 4x8 feet for lots of toys or lumber",So far I can not really think of much. Maybe some additional compartments in the center storage unit like in the Cadillac and some type of coin holder. 
4.875,Getting Better,Scott ,09/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded a 2003 Z71 for a 2008 Z71. Many improvements, all for the better. This is a very dependable vehicle but components do go bad. There are so, so many that make it perform like it does I can't say enough good things about the 2008 Avalanche Z71. It is a go- getter. Although a little pricey the astute buyer can do his homework and negotiate smartly and save some money.","Subtle changes-exterior, chrome door handles, mid point chrome below grille, moving the Z71 to the pillar.","I miss the vinyl cladding. It really protects against stone chips, etc. With a little Vinyl cleaner/dressing the cladding looks brand new in a matter of minutes"
