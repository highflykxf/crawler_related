4,Affordable RWD Sedan with some decent performance,Meat ,11/24/2016,,4,5,,,,5,4,4,,,"helped a friend pick this car out after his driving style indicated he needed something that could take more of a beating.  Model was a burnt orange 3.6 with a fair amount of features for the year and I have to say I was pretty impressed. RWD is definitely the way to go if you're a driving enthusiast you just have to be careful when things get slippery. The car rides very well and is extremely planted on the road. You can feel EVERYTHING you drive over due to the suspension setup and wide sporty tires they use on this but this was made with that in mind so be warned.  Road noise is slightly excessive but bearable as you can hear the engine (which does sound pretty decent) and on the highway wind noise is also tolerable.  Fit and finish of the car are really well and alot of surfaces are soft touch which I do commend the automaker for but they do make the vehicle extremely heavy so the engine does have to work pretty hard from a stop to get moving quickly but again thats something you can easily fix with the GT model of this car. Steering is slightly numb but better than the typical GM fashion that normally goes into vehicles. For a ""sporty"" sedan though it does lack slightly. Overall the car is a great value and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a sportier ride yet needing to keep in mind space in the back and some sensibility.",,

I upgraded from a 2004 Grand Prix, a car that i have thoroughly enjoyed for all of the 104000 miles i put on it and i was completely blown away.  The G8 GT is in my opinion one of the best sport sedans ever produced.  It is gorgeous inside and out.  It doesn't have all that goofy euro sport sedan styling, just big fenders and a beefy body.  100% American muscle.  I would recommend this car to anyone!  Pay the extra for the V8 its worth it.

Aside from the typical oil and battery display complaints and my aversion to everything overcomplicated in the controls of ALL new cars, this car is a more than fitting replacement to my 1991 Caprice LTZ.  Took it on a 1,000 mile road trip first weekend and we love it.  Mileage is as advertised, performs and handles like a dream.

This car has proven that all of the press hype is not hype, it is fact.  It is the best value that any car manufacturer has on the market for the price.  If you want a real car, with real performance, room and quality this is the car. You can spend twice the money and get something like and buy a 5 series BMW, or you can buy the G8 GT get the same performance and have lots of money left over to bay the person at the gas pump.

Getting use to where all the switches are and comfortable with it.  Only big expense besides gas has been a oil change.  8 quarts of Mobil 1 are not cheap. The more I drive this car the more impressed I am with it.  Merging into freeway traffic can be almost frightening.  Any thing more than 1/4 throttle and you are going from 45 mph to 80 mph in about two heartbeats. Even after 3 months it is still hard to get more than 16 mpg.

I was really impressed with how well it's built and how solid it feels on the road. It handles very well and imparts a sense of confidence when I drive it.

The rest of the car is still so new to us that we are still figuring out items. At first blush the one thing that sticks out to me is the tilt wheel. Seems it could have been more akin the tilts in pick ups and suv type vehicle. Not much range of motion, especially when one is in egress mode. Getting in and out is a bit challenging.

I thought right after I bought it, ""Gas prices are going out of site, what did I do?""  The answer after thinking about it and a month with the G8, I don't need steak every night, hot chili and hot dogs are just fine. The fun of driving a real car that has great performance, is more fun at age 61 than a Japanese car that gets 30+ mpg.  The fact that what ever situation I get in I can get out of.  Can a Honda Civic that is stock accelerate out of a situation?  Hell no. Or stop as fast as the G8.  There is more to a car than gas mileage.

This car looks more like a BMW and handles like it! Quite a bit heavier and more responsive that the Grand Prix. Like the GT but decided that I didn't really need the V8 and the V6 really has plenty of power.  The only difference in the two are the quad tail pipes and the clear  tail light covers on the GT. The V6 has dual tail pipes and red light covers.  I agree the amp meter and oil pressure displays need to go. Would like to be able to select items from the DIC and and transfer it to this display.

This car has the spot on steering feel that performance cars should have and driving becomes a pure pleasure once again!
