Frankly, I am sorry I bought it. My previous Sedan STi was undoubtely the most fun, sensitive, firey driving experience I ever had.I looked forward to driving it every day and it was a magical experience. It was like a wild horse at my finger tips.This 2008 limo has been destroyed by Subaru in my opinion. Its acceleration, handling, ride almost feel like an ordinary car. It is boring. I wish I had spent less money and bought the WRX from what I hear.On the other hand, it is, for me,a reliable, stable luxury car of a draft horse that can handle the altitude of Colorado.","Nice , slow, stable feel. You know it won't let you down.",Bring back the 2006 characteristics of the firey Sedan as much as possible. Add an option to stop fishtailing on sharp acceleration and turning as an option.

I was hoping to find something as fun and comfortable as the VW, but with AWD to get me up our steep Vermont hills in winter in the places where the VW failed to make progress.The Outback Sport has turned out to be much more entertaining than I expected.It doesn't have quite the zip of the VW turbo, but it's plenty fast.The biggest surprise was the excellent steering and handling: quite an improvement over the somewhat squishy VW.The next biggest surprise was the fuel economy; I'm getting 28 on average, and as high as 32 on some off-freeway road trips.","Excellent handling, fairly responsive engine, AWD, decent fuel economy, heated seats, good legroom for tall driver.","As others have noted, the passenger seat is a bit low.
I also miss the telescoping steering wheel and sunroof of my old VW.
The VW also had galvanized steel body panels, so I'm sure the Subaru will rust out sooner.
The external styling isn't quite as clean as the VW, but it's an improvement over the previous generation of Impreza.
However, all of this is nitpicking since this generation is due to be replaced in a few months."

Oh, and did I mention that it sat in the shop waiting for Subaru to get off their asses and fix it for over a month each time. On top of that, the transmission has begun to have issues, like it won't go into 1st gear without a horrible grind, the dealer says it is ""Not a major problem""!Headlights failed, rear diff failed, clutch failed due to bad work from the dealer, and the car is still brokenBuy an Evo","The car is fast from the factory, it is quite a blast on the highway! When you get into corners, it is good until you start pushing it, then you run into the understeer. 

The front seats are great, the cluster looks awesome, and the overall feel of the interior is high quality. 

","Fix the issues with the engine Subaru! It is stupid to have to keep putting in entire new engines to fix issues that you could have prevented at the factory! 

Slightly stiffer bushings would help a lot. Steering is fairly sloppy but could be corrected with better bushings in the control arm. There are plenty of small mods that can be done to greatly improve the car's handling and feel from the factory with little or no extra cost. "

The suspension is too soft with an intense amount of body roll, though the ride comfort is much improved (IMO leave that for the Impreza owners, not the WRX). The interior is clean but uninspiring with hard plastic everywhere. Throttle response is slow and the traction/abs systems are intrusive. Exterior styling speaks for itself. The sound system is close to the quality of a cell phone speaker in a tin can. Hatch boom is very prevalent.

I also compared a few 2006-2007 models, but no WRX's  in the same price range. The 06-07's were much more fun to drive-  more connected to the road.  The 08 is much quieter and smoother like a ""grown-up"" car as my wife put it ( she drives an Outback, which we LOVE)   I'm a sporty driver with a heavy foot, and the gas mileage is OK- about 23 for urban- suburban commuting, quite often in bumper to bumper. If you want a gas sipper, look elsewhere. If you want AWD security, your're in the right place. 35 MPG is useless if you can't get out of the driveway.  ","AWD is great- this is our 3rd Subaru. The standard features are fine for an inexpensive car. In regular drive mode, it just putters along. BUT, when you want to play, the Sport mode unleashes the Subie beast. This car runs great!

Engine is very quiet, that my wife can't hear it well, and try to restart it twice. I don't like the abs at times as it kick in prematurely, but most time it is quiet. The interesting ""safety"" feature about the car is that if you forget to tighten your gas cap well, or if any glitches occur in the engine or drive train - the Cruise control light flashes, check engine light goes on, and the traction control light goes on. This scared the jeepers out of me at first - but it is an important safety feature to protect the engine. You can buy a code reader for $20 or take to action auto for the code to be read.

Lastly is build quality. The steering-wheel control of the audio system barely works and I have to press very hard to get it to function.

I'm driving 45,000 miles a year (crazy!) and averaging 30 MPG at usually 70-75 MPH, which is beyond the EPA reading! Cruise control is my friend. Can't beat the AWD in any weather. I HIGHLY recommend any Subaru model to anyone looking for a vehicle. No issues whatsoever with this car. -- If you're car shopping, just take a moment to drive some Subaru's, especially in a downpour or bad weather... I bet you'll be amazed!  For comparison, do the same with other brands. This is when you'll notice more about the true feel of a vehicle versus a bright, dry, sunny day.","Manual transmission (auto was too weak); smooth ride (though it was too ""washy"" until I adjusted to the ride height) after having sports cars; Premium Pkg & lower seats (for the shifting); Body Style; AWD; Because Subaru makes awesome reliable products.",Better paint! I've never had a car's hood chip so easily before. This is my 6th car and even the other Subies didn't chip like this one. Rear hatch rattles. Using tape on the metal ring helps. Sunroof in the Outback version? Better factory roof rails. These are noisy. Diesel?  Please?!?!
2.875,My first Subaru,RT ,07/18/2009,,,2,4,2,5,,2,2,2,4,"All the reviews about paint problems are true. I bought this car 9 months ago and can't believe how fragile the paint is. I've only got 6,000 miles on the car and it looks like there's 4 years of abrasion on the rear qtr panels. Severe chips on the hood and front of the vehicle. Hopefully Subaru officials read these reviews and do something because they're losing customers. This was my first and believe me last Subaru. Unless you want to pay for a total repaint every 3 years stay away from this car. Other Subaru models have the same problem. Oh and do something about the ridiculously low passenger seat and what's with the holes in the front bumper?? Not all states have front license plates!","I like the styling, everything else is average or below.","Put a 5 speed transmission in the car, the 4 speed is totally inadequate.

This model is underpowered and boring to drive, but it gets you to your destination safely and reliably in northern winters.  We have averaged 23.5 mpg and have had zero maintenance issues.  The interior is cheap but well put together and functional.  The rear hatch is poorly designed, when you shut it you either push too light and doesn't latch or push too hard and it rubs the bumper.  I am not happy with the amount of rust developing in the suspension, and may take it in to complain about that.  The paint looks great but it chips and scratches very easily.",AWD and reliable build.,"Buyers: Skip the nav and ipod upgrade and get an aftermarket in dash GPS with iPod and sat radio.

It has been completely reliable and has returned decent fuel economy (25 mpg overall). The only major nit I have to pick is with the passenger seat. It is mounted way too low and has no height adjustment. Makes one feel like a four year old trying to see out.,The interior lay out is attractive. This car is very nice looking in Newport blue.

Handling is a little soft, but it gives a very nice ride. After driving manual for 18 years, I feel the 4spd Auto Trans is very weak. Should have gone with the 5M, I really miss it. That is my mistake. I have a black two tone and the paint scratches very, very easily, more so than any car I have ever had.  AWD is great, and the VDC is really cool. Next year snow tires will go on, which should really improve the AWD. Even with AWD, 17 inch, wide, low profile tires, aren't the best in the snow.  After 30k miles, averaging about 27mpg in all sorts of driving.","AWD of course.  Nice gas mileage. Very roomy inside (except for hatch with all seats up), with nice head room.  Looks great except from directly behind (not a big fan of the clear rear lights). So far very dependable, no issues at all.  Lots of features for 20k.","Stiffer suspension. Better paint quality.

I found the perfect combination with the my black 2008 WRX STI with silver BBS wheels. This car just rocks. Here are the things that I like best about this car: 1. The ability to tune the car between intelligent for daily driving and sport and serious fun with Sport # -- nothing like it on the market. 2. The ability to change the differential for power to the front and rear wheels - tons of options, tons of power, this car moves! 3.

The dealership sold me the car with a dirty interior, and damage to paint on the doors. I was told this was to be fixed by a painter, but even he agreed that the paint was too far beyond repair for a minor touch-up.  Needless to say I'm going to have to sue the dealership and have them investigated for fraud if this isn't fixed.  Thanks for Subaru for not standing behind your cars at all.

I live in NY and the winter here, though not the worst in the country, are still pretty bad. The geography doesn't really help with winter driving either.

Haven't had a single problem yet. ,"Gas mileage, ride, interior, seating position","The radio is kind of cheap, sounding quality wise and watts. The other issue is the body roll. It's not bad, it roll to a certain point then stops, its not  alarming, just wise it would not roll in the corners so much. I guess a set of sport springs would fix that without effecting the ride quality"
5,Impressive Impreza,Subienewbie ,11/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I leased a 08 Impreza in early august.  I test drove the wrx and then decided to go with the 2.5i 4-door as the lease deal seemed to too sweet to ignore.  The car has been fun to drive - it is a real dynamo for its size.  The engine is responsive, smooth and has ample juice on the highway. Long-drives have been at about 30.5 mpg and city at 23 on average. Not bad for a 3200 pound car with awd.  I am really glad I got a subie!",,
4.75,Best for the price,Mike ,10/30/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I got mine more than year ago. So far very pleased by the price/quality/value. I averaged ~22mpg (~6000 city + ~3000 highway) and I'm OK with that considering AWD, 2.5 engine and automatic transmission. I got Dark Gray Metallic colored car with dark interior. So far no mechanical problems - I've changed only oil and air filters. I believe that the engine is great and allows some fun on the road but could get better performance with manual transmission. Unfortunately my wife prefers automatic so we got less fun.","AWD, handling, reliability, safety and looks. Also I got very nice rate for my full coverage insurance compared to competitor vehicles. There is enough leg, shoulder and head room for tall drivers (I'm 6'5"").","Better auto transmission, paint could be scratched very easily especially around door handles, standard audio speakers could be improved. Need better plastic materials for some of the parts like the holder of the fuel tank cap and some of the interior segments."
3.75,Very Good except for torque,AJ ,10/26/2008,,,5,5,4,3,,2,4,4,3,"The car is generally very good.  I got it for an excellent price, even in its first year.  I really like the interior design and layout and the great looking and useful hatch bodystyle.  The interior generally is nice for the $ but I think the red lighting is juvenile and hard to read. The main problem with the car is the short-stroke engine combined with interia of AWD system makes it a torqueless dog both around town and on the highway.  I can't fathom why the engineers would set it up that way.  At least the short gearing kind of makes up for it, but then it ends up feeling like it needs a 6th gear. All together it drives and rides pretty well and is comfortable.  MPG isn't bad for AWD.","Interior design and layout; balanced feel; AWD grip; European good looks; stability control and traction control; steering has good feel and isn't too quick on the highway or too slow to be sporty; compact size; nice turn-in; good ride unless cornering hard; heated mirrors, seats, wiper area.","Torque!! Needs much more torque low but all around as well; needs more power generally; rough engine, especially on start-up; engine noise; leans and bounces in hard cornering; gearing too short, or needs 6th gear; no lumbar adjustment; weak A/C; juvenile red dash lighting; doors very plasticky."
4.375,My first Subaru,Nicole ,10/25/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"This is my first Subaru and I am very happy with it.  I traded in a 2006 Civic that went nowhere in the snow and during Minnesota winters that's not a good thing.  I decided on this because of the AWD, the looks and the price.  I am impressed with the ride, and quality of the car and it has great pick up, it's pretty quick!  Not much road noise either.  Feels like a nice solid ride.  Cant wait for some snow to test it out.  It gets a pretty solid 26 mpg city and when I drove a 200 mile trip all highway it got a solid 32 mpg which I think is great for this car and it isn't even broken in yet.  Overall happy with my purchase and will buy a Subaru again, maybe a Legacy next time :)","The AWD without a doubt, the iPod interface.  I love the Newport Blue Pearl color I have.","The stereo could sound better, although when you put in a CD or use a iPod or MP3 the stereo comes to life."
5,A Practical Commuter with a Soul,Mike ,10/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have only owned the vehicle for a few days, but it is incredibly solid and quite fun to drive.  Going from a Z28 to a four-cylinder was a bit daunting, but the car feels spritely for 170 ponies. Controls are well laid-out and easy to figure out, and the car responds as though it is meant to be driven.  After test-driving a few vehicles (Corolla, Civic, etc) the Subaru was by far the most fun and felt like the best value for my dollar, especially with the full-time All Wheel Drive.  The stereo is a bit tinny (base model), but can be easily upgraded.  Absolutely opt for the auxiliary-input if you get the base model for MP3 connectivity - it's a blast!","Downshifting and blipping the throttle around corners plants the car firmly - good road manners under any driving conditions, and better than projected fuel economy (I've been getting ~25 combined city/highway and the car is still being broken in) - expecting 30+ with average driving.","Base speakers need upgrading; rear drum brakes on base model are solid, but I'd like to see 4 wheel disc. VDC (traction control) now standard on 09, so I'll curb that one! :)"
4.75,Great ride,MikeyEv ,09/27/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought this car in February of 2008. I'm not a big fan of the 4dr, but I do love my 5dr wagon. I had a great buying experience and I got a great deal.  I love the way the car drives. Great all-around ride and suspension. Lots of power. It has very little turbo lag. It's great on hills.  With the seats folded down, there is a lot of space. The car is very practical, reliable, and mostly importantly fun. ",The turbo engine. The 5dr wagon design. Friendly ergonomics.,Power seats.
4.25,Comfortable and affordable,Ty ,09/25/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,4,5,4,4,"This is my first Subaru, and I'm impressed so far.  The ride is a near perfect blend of road feel and impact isolation.  Not even major potholes transfer into the car as harsh impacts.  The steering and brakes are almost perfectly weighted, though I had hoped for more road feel and feedback from a Subaru.  They got most of the interior details right (the steering wheel buttons light up!), but some cost cutting is definitely visible.  I think they did it in the right places, it's certainly forgivable in exchange for AWD and an engine that makes 30 more HP than competitors do.   Overall it drives very nicely for a sub-20K car is getting 5-6 MPG more than my CR-V that had the same MPG rating.","Class leading power from the unique and fun boxer engine, comfortable and well balanced ride, nicely weighted and accurate steering and brakes, seats fit my back perfectly, airy and open feeling light colored interior, audio system uses quality speakers and sounds nicely balanced.","HVAC controls feel cheap and clunky like the kind you see in Fords from the 80's, shift linkage is quite notchy during the first 2000 miles (but smooths out a lot over time thankfully), AWD makes quick launches and fast 1-2 upshifts tricky if they're needed, some obvious interior cost cutting."
3.375,Too many RATTLES,Subie ,09/17/2008,,,3,5,3,4,,4,3,2,3,"New 2008 STi is unquestionably a blast to drive, and I actually prefer the new, toned-down body style.  That said, I'm finding it a difficult daily driver.  Not because of the transmission (clunky) or the gas mileage (mediocre), but because the car rattles so, so, so much.  I've only owned it for a few months, and it is barely out of its break-in period.  But it seems like every time I get in the car, it has developed a new interior rattle.  No use turning to dealerships for help, in my experience, as they either fail to fix the problem, or claim to be unable to replicate it.  Just how high do you have to turn the stereo and a/c to drown out all those rattles, boys?","Sweet new looks, hatchback utility, great seats.",Interior build quality is a step back from previous Subarus.  Car rattles incessantly.  Sad to say this may be my last STi.
4.75,My 3rd Subaru,MK ,09/17/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Subaru makes great cars. This is my third. After having owned 2 used Legacys, over the last 10 years, I decided to spring for a brand new Impreza. For a small car the larger than normal 170 HP really gives it some kick and the AWD and stability control make it do amazing things. Best car in its class. In fact it outclasses everything else which is why it is so under reviewed. It must just confuse auto reporters about how this car fits in with everything else.","Solid, spritely, road hungry feel. I'm 186 cm tall, and I have enough room, even in such a small car.","Subaru's interiors have always been dull. The finishings feel cheap. The only annoying design problem is the door window frame, it is somewhat sharp, so it feels uncomfortable to rest your arm on when you have the window rolled down. "
4.875,Best Fuel Economic AWD on the Market,Stephen ,09/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I searched for the most fuel economic (freeway), AWD (for frequent dirt-roading/all weather) on the market with good interior loading capacity. This car blew the SX4 Crossover AWD (which I test drove) out of the water, especially in loading capacity, and was ~$10k cheaper than the Ford Escape Hybrid (which was great to drive but had about the same fuel economy as the Impreza 180hp).  I've already driven through fields with my Outback Sport in wet weather and it plowed through it like a champion - I can't wait for snow to come this season! This car has already been superior on road trips.  I've noticed the gear ratio used makes for a slight lack of power switching from 4th to 5th. @ ~50-55 mph","25/29 cty/hwy fuel economy, AWD excellence, awesome safety features including surrounding airbag protection, 6' length capacity in the back with seats down (they lay flat! :)), e.g. you likely wont need to use the roof rack, and can remove it for better MPG. Aux plug for MP3!","The mentioned slight lack of power when switching from 4th to 5th gear at ~50-55mph (the manual suggested switch speed for 5th gear). 4th gear obtains excellent torque in which waiting till ~55+mph to switch to 5th fixes this problem. (Also, problem disappears with 226hp models or automatic)."

4.25,Fun little car,robm2 ,09/08/2008,,,4,3,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"A fun car to drive. Not nearly as comfortable as my older VW, but for the same price, I have better handling, AWD for winter snow & ice, and better reliability.  The premium package is a must. In Canada, it is the Sport Package, and heated seats are now a necessity, (I had them in the VW, and will never be w/o them again).  The 170hp/170lb-ft N/A engine is adequate, but if you want some thrills, you may be disappointed. I am selling my '08 2.5i and have already ordered an '09 STI.","AWD, heated seats, boxer engine rumble, hill-holder clutch/brake, MP3/iPod capable stereo, great handling, great gas mileage","Distance to empty mileage indicator, auto-locking doors, auto-unlocking doors on handle pull, lumbar support, better speakers, faster fast-forward / reverse scan on CD player, height-adjustment on passenger seat"

Acceleration is good with the exception of a little turbo lag and the handling is great.   The AWD take a bit getting use to being that you need to use a little more clutch than a FWD or RWD vehicle.  I can wait to see how it does in the snow this winter.  This is my first Subaru, but certainly not the last.","Handling, exterior looks, headroom, rear seat room, front sport seating, and the BIG tach right in the middle.

4,No real complaints,NJ Owner ,08/29/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"Owned since 03/08 and have 11k miles on it.  MPG is good, averaging about 27 with high of 31.5 on highway trip.  I should have gotten the 5M instead of the 4A. I just don't like the automatic transmission.  The black paint seems to scratch very easily, especially from fingernails around the door handles. I wish the hatch area was a little bit bigger.  It looks adequate empty, but fills up real quickly.  Can't wait to drive it in the snow, that's why I bought it.  I am hoping I can get away with the stock tires, but will use snow tires if need be.

5,Better then my BMW,pennfootball71 ,08/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded in a 2001 BMW 330Ci Convertible for this machine. The Subaru has a better ride, handles better, has better room and comfort and even has a CD player my BMW was sans of. Higher RPMs the engine was getting tired so I added a Subaru Performance Tuning Exhaust and a K&N air filter that did the trick and it pulls hard all the way to redline now with no flat spots like before. Short throw shifter took away ""notchyness"" as well as a more comfortable MOMO shift knob. I have 3000 miles on the car and it is a dream to drive, and has a great ride. If you need something more hardcore buy an STI or the 09 WRX next year if you must have gumball tires that last 20 minutes!

I am in my 30s and needed something a bit more, well, practical. I hate to say it. Decent mileage for 305 horses coupled with all wheel drive. I average about 19 city w/ short freeway commutes. This car will haul, groceries, kids, adults, large dogs, and large objects, all at a thrilling pace. It has a firm ride but not harsh. When you drive it, you can tell it means more business than just ho hum commutes.  I would recommend this to any person looking for ""usefulness"" without leaving performance driving pleasure behind. ","Performance. This thing moves! All wheel drive allows you to throw it into any corner at tire screeching speed w/out nary a whimper. Interior is well laid out. Everything you need and some you want. Good interior space, decent fuel mileage, great exterior looks w/out saying ""I'm 16.""","Price of nav w/ premium sound not good. Sound stinks.

This is our first Subaru and so far have been happy. We prefer the more grown up look of the 08 compared to the previous juvenile looking Imprezas. The interior is pretty roomy and comfortable and the exterior is generally pleasant even though it is mistaken for Toyota Corolla by people at first. The car has a nice ride and handles well, the back seat is roomy for a compact and the trunk isn't bad once you factor in the back seat folds down. The cloth seats have a nice look. Gas mileage has been in the 20's with 7500 miles driven.",Over all roomy inside. All wheel drive. More grown up look inside and out.,"The doors inside need finished better, the plastic just seems kind of cheap.

(I even like the weird LED tail lights!)  The upgraded stereo rocks, but I would rather listen to the unique sounding boxer engine.  That engine is a little different than an inline 4.  It produces punchy low end torque, but levels off the higher you rev.  There's really no point in revving it over 3500 rpm!  The slick shifter, loose clutch, and peppy engine make it ridiculously easy to drive.  It's obvious that Subaru focused on utility and comfort for this model, at the sacrifice of agility and handling, but the full time all wheel drive rules!","Sound and feel of the boxer engine, unique appearance, ride quality, affordable all wheel drive.","Cornering ability is disappointing, fuel economy is so-so.

But, if you could give up very little speed and gas mileage, in exchange for top safety ratings, reliability and engineering, would you do it? Now, factor in rain and snow. Not only is Subaru the best bad weather vehicle that is practical for daily driving, it will outperform the rest of the market segment when road conditions are tough. The symmetrical AWD system does not introduce any of the instability or inefficiency cause by the systems that divert power off-axis. Pick a nasty day and go drive one to see for yourself.","If you have to go out, regardless of the weather, and you don't want to keep a 2nd specialty vehicle in your garage, there really is no better car.

I have now switched to seeing how well I can make the MPG go up with the nav display.  It can get around 30 or maybe a tad more on the highway.

I studied (e.g., Consumers Reports, JD Powers, Edmunds.com, etc.) and found no rivals...mostly because Versa, Fit, Yaris, Mazda 3 do not offer all the above. There are better stereos, acceleration and MPG out there, but nothing that rates at least a ""good"" at everything. Most new owners are excited with their cars, so only time will tell the truth. However, my 3 months/5,0000 miles experience support the claims of other professional reviews and the positive history of this car model. ",Fit & finish. Gas mileage I get for an AWD is 25 mpg combined. Ergonomics. ,"Sways left-right a little during avoidance-type maneuvering.

The ride, even with STi pink springs is smooth and predictable. With the springs, the stock roll is gone. Mileage is surprising - about 25mpg, and I'm suburban commuter, 28 miles/day at 40mph avg. Stay out of boost, and it'll give you economy. I look forward to driving this car every day. It's noticable, but not showy. It's fast, but not impractical. It's comfortable, but not plush.

This is the fist year that I am actually looking forward to the winter here in New York. Can't wait for the snow! I usually hate driving in the snow but after all the you tube videos of the Impreza's in the snow I cant wait! The only thing I regret is not getting the WRX sti. I might try to trade mine back in for it but not sure. Other than that I love it!,Boost when driving on the 5M! The AWD. The boxer engine! ,Seats need power! The whole handle thing is kinda cave man! Also the passenger side seat needs more options.. 
4.75,Great car!,Mike ,06/19/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is a great car. I have owned a Legacy and Outback Wagon, and the 2008 Impreza WRX is a different car - but still a Subaru in all respects. The WRX is fast, fun, and AWD. Pics do not do the new body style any justice. Lots of reviews slam Subaru for making the WRX more ""mainstream"" to appeal to a larger audience. So what. It's a blast to drive!","Turbo, AWD. Safe","Stereo is still a weak point with Subaru. It's okay, but nothing special. Sheet metal (especially the top of the front fenders) seems really thin. Door handles are not a solid feel. "

4.875,2008 Subaru WRX STi vs. 2008 Mitsu Evo,Perry1 ,06/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After reading extensive reviews and test driving both the 2008 STI and the new Evo, I purchased the STI. Evo is more boy racer vs. STi's maturity. The STi is a pleasure to drive. The seats are more comfortable than the Evo's for longer distance driving. STi also has 3 different driving modes depending on what type of driving you want to do - Intelligent/everyday vs. Sport vs. Sport Sharp, a cutting edge racing type driving mode that gobbles up a tank of 93 octane like nobody's business! The Sport Sharp mode is like flipping a nitrous switch and boosts the already awesome acceleration over 3500 rpm. I actually have the little woman thinking that my, sorry, ""our"" new STI is a great family car!","Performance, truly a pleasure to drive, exhaust note, practicality, cargo space. The styling is also great, and I get a lot of thumbs up from people checking the car out. Interior has a nice fit & finish too, unlike Evo's heavily plastic interior. This is an awesome year round sports car. ","The only improvement I can think of would be if the car were cheaper, but Subaru already got my money, so what good will it do me?"
4,"I really like it, but...",Unearthed ,06/16/2008,,,5,5,3,3,,4,4,4,4,"This car does a lot of things really really well, but a couple of things keep me from giving it a 10 across the board. First and foremost, with 450 miles on it we have already developed a squeak/rattle from the dashboard. We've also had the radiator light come on for a minute when the car was only on for about 2 minutes. Other than that I love the way the car looks and it is very comfortable to drive. It's not quick, but it has enough power and it handles decently. The automatic trans seems a bit clunky, but I'm used to a manual so perhaps it's just me adjusting. For 21k I don't think there are too many cars out there that offer the features the Impreza does and also have 4WD/AWD.","Exterior looks (Wagon, the sedan is blah) AWD and traction control. Comfortable interior. Great value in this price range. Good safety ratings","Questionable build quality. Worried about reliability. 24mpg is nothing great in a car, but it weighs more than a normal car and has AWD. Very low to the ground for a 4WD/AWD vehicle. Leather is not a factory option, had to pay dealer to install leather seats "
3.875,Great Car,Nick ,06/12/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,3,4,"This is a great car. The only problem is the gas mileage, so I bought the manual and with some careful driving I can stay at 26 MPG, even in the city. Interior plastic feels cheap, but is study enough. For its engine size and weight it performs well enough though not exemplary. The Nissan Altima was a better ride but lacked electronic stability control (called VDC in the Subarus). Performance package is a must-have, it replaces the rear brake drums with safer discs. Also adds in-wheel radio controls and a six-CD in-dash changer. Shocks are pretty good. Tight fit for rear passengers. Corners very well.","A list of safety features as long as my arm, especially with the performance package replacing the rear brake drums with discs. The in-wheel radio controls are great.  Looks great.  Wish I'd bought the WRX model. Hill assist starter, and audio-in port are great standard features.","Sunroof, larger armrest, telescoping wheel & wheel doesn't tilt enough so I have to keep my seat on the floor to be correctly positioned, power seats, better MPG, six gears"

My only complaints are road noise on the highway, and uncomfortable headrests (they push your head forward). I like the way it looks and drives so far, but we'll see after the upcoming winter. That's the reason why I bought a Subaru, for all the bad weather driving we do in New England.",,Wish I could have opted for smaller wheels- 17 inch alloys are a bit much. More comfortable headrests. A drivers seat that goes up a bit higher (I sit too low). It would have been nice to have the option of a sunroof.

All in all, we are very satisfied with the vehicle and get about 23.5 miles to the gallon with 80% city driving. Highly recommend this vehicle.","This car has an incredible turning radius. Parking is a cinch. Sound system is adequate, but nothing special. Folding rear seats are great and backseat legroom is pretty good, too. I had enough pep with the a/c turned on to merge into Phoenix rush hour traffic. Styling is great. A/C is average.","The center armrest is too short to be effective, and the ext.

I have been getting on average 26 to 28 MPG mixed highway/city driving. The car is very roomy, and the seats are comfortable.  The ride is greatly improved over previous years with the new rear wishbone suspension and the outback raised suspension helps too. The acceleration is a bit slow but I am more intersted in saving gas these days. The maneuverability of the vehicle is great too, very responsive. I live in Vermont and I got his car because I knew it would help out in the winter season and that to me is worth a sacrifice in fuel economy. Usability over gas.","AWD, stick shift, tail lights, roof rack, comfortable seats, red gauge lights, stereo is pretty good (better with CD's than radio), clutch is very smooth, back seats have good room, lots of storage space, window frames cut out exterior sound, overall a very solid and well built ride from what I see.","A sunroof would be great, we all want better gas mileage but it could be worse, a sixth speed to drop the RPM's on the highway.

We had tons of snow in Vermont this winter, and I was able to drive anywhere with the standard all-weather tires. While the drive doesn't quite have the feel of a European car, the 5 speed is fun enough and the price tag for an AWD vehicle is just right. Love the hatch for bike/skis/dog etc., and the premium package with the VDC, leather stuff and 6 disc changer is totally worth the money. MPG is better than expected.

The power delivery is more linear, which makes it seem like it's not faster than previous version but speedometer says otherwise :-)  The suspension offers no shock to the kidneys over bumps while retaining the ability to take corners at much higher speeds than the old versions.   I love that the car looks more aggressive but does not grab the attention like the old versions with the big wing.  Sleeper look.","The wide body look, fender flares look awesome.  Hatchback utility.

The Outback sport has a slightly raised suspension over the stnd impreza allow it to be taken light offroading plus that allows the snow to not build up as much when driving.

I tried the Scion xB, Mazda 3, Rabbit S 4 dr, and the Saturn Astra. I don't think you could go wrong with any of them. But, when you factored in what you can buy them for they were dealing on the Subaru plus you get AWD which was a huge selling point.  The VW is supposed to be the gold standard at this price point, but the Subie was IMHO less plasticky. I needed the versatility of a hatchback, hence the 5 door. I must admit though the xB looked huge on the inside. But I got more car for the money. ","AWD, handling, styling, nice dash layout/materials. Not everyone is driving one. ","Heated seats, moonroof.

It does lean a bit as others have mentioned but not to a point of concern.  My only complaint is of some dash plastic vibrations, lack of a sorely needed 5 speed auto, and lack of moonroof.

The ride is smoother than the 05 model and generally feels more refined. The interior has plenty of little features I'd be wishing for in the previous iterations. ","As a GPS virgin, the nav system is by far my favorite toy at the moment. The novelty of it will eventually wear off and when it does I doubt the plus of GPS will offset the lack of a multi-disc in dash CD player.

The look grows on me more and more.  Roof rack is noisy, but easy to take off. Not a big fan of the stereo, the sound never seems to fill the cabin or your ears.

Most of the major issues on the earlier models (interior quality, handling, braking, climate control, tires, etc.) have been addressed, mostly successfully. The 2008, IMO, is far closer to the ideal of a WRX w/o the turbo than past attempts. The OBS's ability to travel through rain/sleet/snow, etc. is superb. Still, its appeal will likely be limited to those who value 4wd and a sporty image over size, utility, and gas mileage.","Full-time 4wd. Safety packege is world class.

Try all the above in Wisconsin weather and you would know what I am talking about. Try the Impreza AWD and you would know why the trucks rush past you without caring much about the snow. It is the AWD, baby! The only thing I care about is the mileage. It is low but the car can give you more than 20 mpg driven in city conditions. It is as powerful as my Camry and does groan as others do when you hit the gas. The pickup is instant. The steering does not vibrate when on highway.

It's definitely a joy to drive around.  It makes you hate city traffic, bored with open highway, and eager for some empty country roads.  It would be nice if it were a bit quieter, but then it would be a Saab.  I originally wanted a Saab 9-2 a few years ago, but it was discontinued and this car substitues perfectly, with the added bonus of AWD.  I'm getting 25 mpg on mixed travel.

The base stereo (4 speakers) is actually OK and doesn't distort at high volume. I will be adding the Subaru subwoofer soon. The ride is great and the car feels like it has claws that attack the road. 5 spd is fun since you have more control. Trunk loses some space as it raises toward the back because of the new double wishbone suspension. Interior is good for the price. Plastic used on the door and dash, but for $16k I don't mind. I like the looks of the 2007 better, but oh well. The 08 is more ""grown up"" looking. ","MPG readout. It really helps to conserve gas when wanted.

The WRX is a terrific combination for a cold weather city like Chicago: rocket like power and superb handling mated with all wheel drive and excellent cargo capacity.  I'm finding that the WRX has bigger back seats and tons of trunk space so I'm not missing the wagon back.  The refinement and finish and quiet ride of the interior is a world apart from the Forester.  The only other car I would have considered would have been the Mazdaspeed3 but then I would have the awd for the weather.

It is a simple car that is very comfortable, quicker than most and a whole lot of FUN. The more I drive it, the more I like it.

I don't care what the fascia looks like, so long as it's not hideous, & I'm not impressed with faux luxury touches on the inside, like aluminum trim or cow-hide.  I want a practical but fun car, on a budget.  Scooby-Rex fits that bill perfectly.  It has been incredibly fun to drive, lots of power even below 3K rpm, handles like a dream, satisfying engine growl yet reasonably low road noise, and the sport-shift automatic is the best of both worlds.

Driving in the rain feels like the traction is that of a tank and its control is superb like the feel of a running back on a highway full of blockers. Interior material is much more durable than other imprezas. Highway driving at 23.5 mpg, city at 18.6 right now, the trip computer allows for an average mpg reading.

Like most Subarus it's neither hideous or gorgeous -- a few years behind the competition in styling and execution --  but it is solid, versatile, hopefully as trouble-free as my '04 was. Yes, it is more softly sprung than my old car but honestly I don't miss the go-kart ride. This car does however have a bit more 'float' in fast turns than my old car due to the softer springs - don't like that. Still sticks great, not a dealbreaker! Give the car a look.","Improvements from my '04 OBS: normal back seat, wider, but shorter, with longer wheelbase. Tons of power, handles well in most situations. Subaru AWD is amazing -- haven't been in snow yet, but my '04 was amazing in snow and mud - never slid, never out of control. Comfy (but lower) drivers seat.","Very cheap sounding stereo, hard plastic everywhere (my '04 at least had cloth on the doors), softened springs give better ride but a bit more roll, although the car still sticks in turns.

I selected the 2008 Impreza because of its looks, performance, price and safety features. I test drove a 2007 Impreza Outback Wagon (the dealer was trying to give it away) and was not happy with its performance or appearance.  The re-designed 2008 has an upgraded appearance and performance with a sport car attitude.  While it may not look like a traditional Impreza, I think the exterior is sharper than the 2008 Legacy Sedans (looks like a VW Jetta).  I am very happy with my selection, its driveability and (of course) its AWD and great handling (better than the Legacy).","Have to get the Premium Package (it's worth the extra $1200 or so). You get six disc CD, upgraded interior, fog lamps, & vehicle dynamics control (VDC)-a great safety feature.  Also has 16"" aluminum alloy wheel, dual front air bags, side curtain airbags, 4 wheel DISC brakes.","So far my gas mileage around the city has been on the low end of the stated fuel economy rating, 16-17 mpg.

So far, I'm enjoying it a whole lot.  Premium features incorporated in the Outback Sport are very worthwhile.  VDC/TCS addition in an under $20,000 AWD car is impressive.  Yes, I have a 2000 RS 2.5 that beats this car in handling, but that is not something that happened between model years.  From my perspective, whatever compromises were made were worth it.

5,Subaru Hatch ,subie 08 ,10/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just purchased an 08 hatch, premium w/ sat radio. Very impressed with the ride and build quality. I think the hatch looks very cool, and its already been handy.  ","AWD, hatchback, performance and fuel economy. MPG calculator, VDC - traction control and hill assist on manual are very good.  ","Interior seems touchy, I foresee it scratching easily."
4.625,New 2008 Impreza,jchaplain ,09/26/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"After researching cars for under $20,000 including the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic I ended up buying the new 2008 Impreza which has a brand new body style this year. I read a few reviews that said this car lacks style but I feel the exact opposite. I got the silver 2.5i sedan premium package with a spoiler and it looks awesome, very stylish. Plus the biggest feature the Corolla and Civic does not have is the all wheel drive which makes the car extremely safe and fun to drive. If you're looking for a great car under $20,000 I highly recommend the 2008 Impreza, and this comes from a guy who never pictured himself in a Subaru!! ",New body is extremely stylish. All wheel drive system is amazing. Great on gas for an AWD vehicle.,Interior is nice but always room for improvement.
4.875,Fun and Comfortable,Sam ,09/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I have just over 1,600 miles on this car and I have grown to love it. The performance levels are so high that you have to get used to them before you can start enjoying the car as a driver's car. It is a wonderful car to drive around town and smooth and quiet on the highway. The suspension is communicative without being harsh. You get the information you need through the wheel and your seat, but it isn't in the sharp way of some performance cars. The gear change can be notchy, but the engine is a torque monster with plenty of power from 2,500 RPM. The sound system is nice, although it could use a subwoofer as standard and not an option.  I am getting around 26 MPG mostly country driving.","I love the AWD and the turbo. The sound system is really nice and I have actually found a situation where I needed to waste some time and watched an iPod video on the monitor. It isn't just a gimmick. It drives more like a european car, and deserves a look if you like the GTI, especially as a hatch.","Grippier tires. They are decent, but not great and this car deserves great. There is some body roll. It is nothing that some anti sway bars can't handle, and it is only noticeable when you are at around 9/10ths. A 6 speed. But that is dreaming."
4.75,Excellent and fun to drive,Michael Russell ,09/18/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I love my new 2008 Subaru Impreza 2.5i premium. It handles like a dream in all kind of weather. The quality is great and I like the all wheel drive for the winter. I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a real value but does not want to buy a large SUV. The gas mileage around town is about 25 mpg. Have not had a chance to take it on a long trip yet but I am sure it will do just fine. Great car Subaru. Keep building them like this and I will buy another one in the future. I traded a ford ranger truck in for my Subaru.,The info center. 6 disc CD changer. All the air bags. All wheel drive.,More little pockets for cell phones and what-not. A sun roof with the premium package.
4,Very good car,St. Nick ,09/17/2007,,,4,4,4,5,,3,4,4,4,"Yeah, the handling isn't tight as my old 2.5 RS Impreza but its almost as much fun to drive with a much improved ride, a good tradeoff if you drive on rough roads.  Also the overall interior design, room, and build quality is  better too. It's almost as big as a Legacy on the inside. The fuel economy is better than the EPA figures.  I get 27 mpg in mixed city/highway driving and the motor is not even broken in yet. Get the manual transmission unless you totally hate them.  The four speed mutes the performance of the spunky motor a bit too much.  The manual 2.5is almost make you forget about the WRX when you consider insurance and $3.25 premium gas.","Interior design, build, ride, handling, flat 4 engine sound and you don't often see them.  AWD is great in the winter and enhances handling very nicely.  ","Put the 5 speed auto from the Legacy Turbos/6 cylinder in please.  The current 4 speed auto needs to be retired.  Make a sport suspension at least optional, Subaru is on the verge of ruining its image and a few extra sales won't matter in the long term.  Improve the base audio system."
4.75,2008 Subaru 2.5i,skiboardebum420 ,08/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"375 miles, and so far, the car has been great!  I commute over a 9,500 ft twisty mountain pass every day, this car handles the road great and even without the turbo has plenty of power.  I, a die hard manual trans fan, purchased the automatic, VERY happy with the tiptronic auto-stick.  First tank of gas averaged 25.7 mpg. Looking to be much better for second tank.  Can't wait for the snow to fly so I can test the AWD system :)",Very smooth and quiet on the freeway.  Nice interrior.  Rear seats fold down!!  Good price and good gas mileage for an AWD.,"Base model has drum brakes in the rear, a little disapointed to see that.  Base model stereo sounds good, but not great. Heater/ac very noisy when on high."
