5,Unsurpassed Quaility and Off Road Capabilities,LC Prado ,08/31/2016,,,,,,,,4,,,,"I traded up from a FJ Cruiser to this. In short, it's an amazingly comfortable SUV that excels at off road performance. Based on the Land Cruiser Prado sold pretty much everywhere else in the world except the US (think sand dunes and the bush), this truck is NOT a pimped out 4Runner. The full time 4WD, V8, rear air suspension, build quality, comfort and reliability combined make this rig unsurpassed for those who venture beyond the mall. These trucks are often referred to as out of date dinosaurs, and are compared to their unibody competitors who may outperform in terms of drivability and road manners; but this truck is built for towing, adverse driving conditions, and off-road capabilities while maintaining superior daily driver comfort for the whole family. If thatâ€™s not what you need, then look elsewhere. If it is, then look no further, spend a little extra up front, and drive it for another 200k miles. The KDSS version will decrease road body roll and improve off-road capabilities, as well, but they are hard to find. Not so great features include: limited 3rd row seating space and comfort, high (but rare) repair costs, fuel efficiency, styling (face it, it's ugly front most angles), and rear door.",,
4.125,"Great SUV,But...",carenthusiast7 ,04/05/2011,,,4,3,4,5,,5,5,4,3,"For an SUV it's very good with plenty of space unless you have a family or carrying more than 5 people, then some issues arise. The third row isn't exactly spacious and kids will fight for the mid row to avoid the third. Gas mileage is self explinatory since it runs on a V8. Power is plenty when you need it on highways and even after years, the GX is still fairly quiet even with a V8. All in all, it is a great SUV, just be prepared for gas trips and the questionable third row.",The GPS and extra electronics make this SUV even more comfortable. The resale value is also fairly high for this SUV as opposed to others which is also another plus.,Just drive more gentely on this SUV if you want to save gas is all and a family of six is probably the maximum if you are looking fo an SUV such as this anymore and I suggest looking for a van.
4.75,Love my Lexus ,Linda ,07/23/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I purchased a used 2008 Lexus GX470 2 weeks ago with just 7500 miles. I love this car! I previously drove an Acura MDX and this vehicle is so much more comfortable. The ride is smooth and there is no road noise at all. My only issue: my Blue tooth. I can hear perfectly but no one seems to hear me! Hopefully, this can be fixed. If you enjoy an SUV but yearn for the smooth ride of a luxury sedan, consider this model! ","Seat comfort, navigation system, stereo system and air ride.","Blue Tooth not clear, add storage compartments  in vehicle. Should offer XM radio for the price. "
5,Best of all luxury SUV,Sam ,04/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Of all the vehicles I have owned, this must be the best one suited for the whole family. Used to drive an Infiniti Q45 that was an excellent vehicle but not enough room, my wife drives a Honda Pilot, which I dread to drive because of intolerable road noise. The GX470 is the end result of my hours of research and test drives. It is like driving in the quiet comfort and luxury of my previous Q45, with the roominess of the Honda Pilot.","Navigation, ride and comfort, high quality interior materials. ","Needs HID, replace the rear barn door with power lift hatch, flat to floor folding third row seats. "
4.375,"Versatile, Comfortable, Impressive",RNarenDMD ,01/13/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,2,4,"I picked up my GX in 3/08.  I wanted to wait awhile before posting a review to allow for some perspective.  The craftsmanship and build quality is fantastic.  Power train the smoothest I've experienced (previous BMW owner).  The car has been 100% trouble free so far (14K miles).  No squeaks or rattles to speak of.  Superb driving position and seats. Having just moved into a new house with a new baby, this car has been very useful for carrying boxes, etc. Rock solid in snow as well. Wish gas mileage was better though; I've been averaging 17.5 mpg on premium.  I would recommend this car as long as you don't mind the mileage.","V8 engine, seats, cargo space, quiet interior, Bluetooth, overall feeling of quality","Gas mileage, 3rd row seats that don't fold into trunk, cannot use nav while driving, and difficult to scroll on map using the touchscreen.  There should be a joystick like on Honda/Acura."
5,Still love it - after a year,BoRock ,12/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was the first one here to write a review (see bottom). It has been a year and a month and a happy 14,000 miles since I got my 2008 GX470. What can I say, I STILL LOVE IT.  I feel like 100 bucks when I get in and I know I made the right choice when I get out. Every day I look forward to driving the car. I use it primarily for commuting to my workplace (40 miles both ways). When I get home it feels nice to know that this great vehicle is waiting for me in the morning.  I had 2 problems: driver side mirror was sticking and my aluminum wheels had some black spots. Both problems were fixed promptly and the dealer even apologized for the inconvenience. I will drive this truck forever!","Space inside, while small overall. Distinct look.",I still want the push button start
4.875,Accept no substitutes!,Raingeardude ,10/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I can't say enough great things about this truck!  It's a phenomenal piece of machinery and if you love the 4runner, the GX 470 will put it to shame and make you wonder why you ever drove one!  The ride is smooth.  The interior is plush and luxurious.  It rides so quiet!  As many have said already, there are a few things that need improving but that's the advantage when you own one.  You know it will only be a few years before they roll out the next new model.  I just couldn't be happier.  I traded my RX350 in for this and I think I made an excellent choice.  Much roomier, not too much difference on the gas mileage and it's just a more solid vehicle.  Truly outstanding product!","Heats up in a snap!  Keyless start is a great option.  Navigation is top notch with vibrant color screen and easy to use buttons.  Seats are angled high so you're looking down towards the road, unlike the 4runner.  Big side windows.  Ultra smooth ride!","Push botton start (coming to the 2011 model).  Push button 4WD shifting (also coming to the 2011 model).  Back door should lift up (also coming to the 2011 model).  Fold down into the floor 3rd row seating (also coming to the 2011 model).  Get to know this vehicle now, don't wait until 2011!"
5,Best car,AnthonyL88 ,10/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was driving a 2006 Acura MDX.  I then decided to take a look at Lexus.  Well, so far the GX470 drive like a GEM.  The ride is very smooth and I really couldn't be happier. ","The interior is very nice, navigator/Mark Levinson stereo. ",3rd row seats being hidden away and not toward the side.  Power tailgate.  XM radio standard with the car.
4.75,Love My Lexus,Renee999 ,08/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"This is my first Lexus and I love it.  I traded in my BMW 530 because I now have 5 grandchildren and I needed more room.  I looked at the Volvo X90 and the 3rd row seat was not very accessible, Sequoia and Tahoe are too big.  This LX 470 is just right.  The third row seats are very easy to fold up and down.  The ride is very smooth and luxurious.  The bluetooth and navigation system are easy to use.  I am very happy I bought this car. ","Folding third row seats, Bluetooth and navigation.",Seat warmer controls are in an odd placeand the dial seems antiquated.  Gas mileage could be better.
5,Overall Impressed,Suburb Boy ,06/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This was the first Lexus we have purchased and traded in an 05 MDX.  We have had the car since December of 2007 and have put 10,000 miles on.  The ride is superb and the acceleration and handling are just right for a vehicle this size.  This is the first car my wife ever said that she liked.  We considered the RX, but it was smaller than the MDX we traded, so we went with the GX for the extra space.  The build quality is superb and every angle you look exemplifies luxury.  The handling in the snow is superb and you feel safe at all times.  Was very impressed how well the vehicle handled considering its height.  If you're thinking about the GX, its well worth it and you won't be disappointed.  ",Navigation and Bluetooth.  Luxurious interior with the highest quality materials.  Sporty yet luxurious look of the exterior.  Graphite alloy wheels - they help hide dirt and brake dust.  Adjustible suspension and height control.,Offer the vehicle in the Flint Mica/Graphite color.  Power tailgate would be nice considering price of vehicle.  Additional power outlets in the front would be nice - currently only one.  Eliminate the ashtray as that could provide additional storage space.  
2.5,Our piece of crap Lexus,m ,04/25/2008,,,2,2,4,4,,2,4,1,1,We bought this car in November before Thanksgiving and I wish we would not have. We compared it between the Tahoe and Escalade and decided to go with the Lexus because of the resale value. What I really hate this car because of the lack of trunk space with the third row folded up and the big bulky 4wd shifter. Most manufactures have put 4wd at the touch of a button and lexus desided to leave it as a shifter to take up half of center console. Because of the positioning of the shifter and 4wd shifter you have to reach around to control the heated seat controls which gets old real quick. The transmision is all so a joke because it has shifted into a higher gear as soon as i begin to lay into it,The plush leather seats and that is about it.,"get rid of all the plastic outside, fix the transmision shifting, get rid of the 4wd shifter in the center console, the lack of storage in the back, better gas milage on premium fuel, blue head lights, bigger gps screen, make the back hatch open up not out, "
4.875,"Love This Vehicle, Glad I Got One!",The Dre ,04/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Traded my 2001 4Runner for a 2008 Lexus GX.  What a great upgrade from the Toyota model to their luxury brand.  This vehicle rides amazingly smooth.  It is a little thirsty on the tank, but hope this improves over time.  The seats are extremely comfortable and all the features in it are just wonderful to use.  We love the looks we get riding around town in this.  You see why Lexus is at the top of their game.","Love the sound system and the ride on it is so smooth.  We drove it from Kansas City on a 4 hour trip back to our home and the ride is phenomenal.  The XM integration works wonderfully.  Like the auto windshield wipers, too.","Needs an iPod interface, voice recognition on the nav system could be better."
4.875,Simply the Best,Liquiddi ,01/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I bought an 08 GX 470 for my wife and love every bit of this truck.  I own an 06 Trailblazer SS and love it to death.  I can say the Lexus out performs the SS in every category except performance.  The Lexus is tight  The doors don't rattle when you shut them. At the age of 33 I'm really sick of all the American cars I've had.  I guess I'm getting old and tired of dealing with the problems. GX 470 is awesome.,"Nav is nice, good power, great quality for the price.  Perfect ride for being 4wd capable.","Heated seats are not hot enough, get rid of loud clutch fan in the engine. Make the dash look like a 06 Lincoln Aviator, passenger side seat should move up and down."
4.875,We Love It,Lexx777 ,01/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is my 5th Lexus, had two ES 300 sedans, and this is my third GX 470.  We love the luxury ride, the look, the amenities, the comfort, and the regular mountain driving is superb. I trade every two years, and don't think I would ever consider another car as nothing I have seen matches the quality and the Lexus service.","Colors available are fantastic. Leather is real quality, navigation and sound system are incomparable, and the Lexus Link is a really special extra.","Larger glove box would be great. Everything else I would want is already there! Third row seats would be for very small children, but are easily removed and stored."
4.875,Just Bought My Lexus,Lyz ,01/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We bought our GX on 12/24/07. We looked at the Sequoia and the Yukon. I drove all three. The GX blows the other two away in driving luxury. We were selling our 12 yr old Jeep Grand Cherokee and needed something bigger. The Lexus is a great SUV for both road trips and everyday driving. 3 days after buying it we put drove it to the UP Michigan for a ski vaca. Drove great in the snow and the long distance. Third row is easy to remove for extra storage. I thought I'd hate the way the hatch opens in the rear, but I am liking how easy it is to get things in and out. My only complaint is I wish the side mirrors folded in mechanically and the third row folded flat, that's it. ",Reclining 2nd row for kids to sleep. Turning radius is great. Head room. Favorite feature is the change suspension option. Navigation system.,"Change wheel well size, too large for standard tire. Fold flat third row. Mechanical side mirrors. 20"" rim options."
5,Great car for the price,BoRock ,11/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just picked up my new car last night. Already put 200 miles and loving it.  If you want speed, performance and fuel economy, get something else.  If you want plush luxury ride with great ergonomics this is it. I had 2000 LX 470 which was a little too big for me. My wife has a 2007 RX 350 - a little too small for me and too many chicks riding in that.  But when I got into GX, I knew right away, its a match made in heaven.","Hight position, nav with camera, Mark Levinson sound, iPod hook in and bluetooth.",Push button start.
4.875,It really is this good,GX Fans ,11/01/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After driving a Durango for many years, we wanted something a little nicer but still powerful enough to keep up our active outdoor lifestyle. We were looking at the Sequioa, but decided that for a little more the GX had all that we wanted and more. This is a great deal. The vehicle performed on a recent road trip under conditions ranging from 110 degrees to below 32 without any issues. It handled on ice, snow, mud, dirt, rock and pavement better than expected. Performance is unbelieveable when you accelerate. It tows like a truck and the engine doesn't even balk. Sometimes it is easy to forget that you aren't driving a luxury sedan. The only close competition is the Mercedes GL class. ","The nav is top-of-the-line. Integrated Bluetooth works flawlessly with the RAZR. The leather is the highest quality we have encountered. Reclining rear seats are a plus. Seats 8, bring some friends along! Adjustable suspension (the sport mode is great on the highway - 4x4 does wonders off road).","An integrated iPod port would be ideal. 6 more inches of space behind the third-row seats would be nice. Change the look of the front/grill so it looks as beefy as it performs. Rear sun-roof for the traditional adventurer feel? Debug a few things on the voice-recognition, otherwise it's outstanding."
