5,"Bought it with 180k miles, and it rides like new!",Indiana Bruce ,10/29/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,"I saw this on a dealers lot with over 180,000 miles on it, and it looked like new.  Knowing it was a Toyota, I bought it.  Am SOOOO glad I did.  I have the 6 cylinder and often pull a 7x14 lightweight cargo trailer with it.  It does great.   I love so many things about Toyotas.  A headlight went out, and it was about $12 and took less than 5 minutes to replace.  I just changed the oil tonight, and it's so easy.  The filter is easy to get to, and even has a shroud around it to catch any oil that runs off so it doesn't mess up the engine area.   Oh, and it's now about 210,000 and doesn't use a DROP of oil and runs like new.  The body and paint are still perfect with no signs of rust or corrosion.  I expect to easily get 300k or maybe more.  Love, love, love it.",,

With normal dealer maintenance there have been no problems at all.  The only design element that you need to adapt to are the heat/air buttons.   I have no trouble with winters in Iowa, and always look forward to driving this sharp looking model.  I just noticed that Consumer Reports listed the 4Runner as the #1 most reliable vehicle.

Did not get the sunroof option as it really does limit head room.  I get about 14-15 mpg in the city but average 21-22 on the highway. The only way that I have been able to get better on the highway is on roads with a 55mph limit.  Then I can get around 24mpg.  I really like pretty much everything else about this vehicle.   We pulled out the fold up rear seats and used the 4runner as pick up during a recent move.  Great family vehicle as well.,Attention to detail.  No rattles.

Only complaint is cargo space is low compared to a highlander, but that's the trade off for an SUV with a body-on-frame construction. We have a large Yakima box for the roof which fits all the overflow cargo when going on vacation.

It suffered a severe side impact at 55 MPH, rolled twice, slid on its roof and ended up with the driver's side on the ground. I walked away with no serious injuries. Even though there was severe damage to the sides and roof of the vehicle and suspension parts and some of the drivetrain were all over the highway, the roof pillars never collapsed and the interior was intact.  Before making the 06 purchase, I did check to see which SUV's best protect their occupants. The 4Runner was the leader hands down.  Now I am driving an 08. This time I made sure that I had the side curtain air bags.",Very  comfortable and fun to drive on our three hour drive to the mountains. Capable of off-road navigation from the dealer. My dogs love the rear cargo area.,
4.75,I love this vehicle,reggie1906 ,03/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,This is my first SUV and I have test driven plenty of them.  The design of this vehicle is awesome.

4.875,Love Toyota,PHIL ,03/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have a 2008 Sport Edition with the V8. I love driving the car. For a truck based chassis, it is a nice ride. If I wanted a car base SUV, I would have purchased a car or a Highlander. The gas mileage could be better, but after all it is a truck with a big V8.

I love this SUV.  I tested the V6 but found it too buzzy and underpowered (my last car was a Subaru Legacy GT though which was very fast).  The V8 is buttery smooth.  The ride on the highway is almost as smooth as my wife's Lexus GX470.  Great size (not too big, not too small).  Trip computer is a bit optimistic.  I average about only 17mpg doing mostly highway driving at 70-75 mph.  Hopefully fuel stays cheap!",Looks like a real SUV should.  Cross-overs don't do it for me.  Quiet and solid feeling. Drive through a 3 foot tall snow bank like it's not even there.    ,SR5 radio sounds pathetic.  Paint chips very easily on the front bumper and hood. Mileage is not great for a mid-size SUV.  My friend's full size GMC V8 pickup gets the same mileage. How about cylinder-deactivation on the V8 like GM and Dodge? Headroom is very limited in the front seat & I'm only 6'

4.25,Okay vehicle,Randy ,02/14/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,3,3,4,"I drove two Pathfinders for a total of almost 20 years and wish I had stuck with them. While I agree with what most of the reviewers say about the SR5, I find it difficult to understand when they say it has a smooth ride. To the contrary, I find it stiff, bouncy, and very fatiguing, and nothing like the Pathfinders which were very smooth and non-fatiguing. One other gripe. The displays for the radio/CDP and the stuff below are extremely dim. I can barely read them in daylight hours and there's no way to brighten them up. Audio quality is also mediocre. I will keep it for three years or less and then trade it in when I can afford to. ","None I can think of. Perhaps it's build quality, but it's brand new so have no way of knowing what the long term outcome will be.",Soften up that ride and do something about the display as noted above. It is extremely dim.
5,Best SUV,James ,01/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I recently bought my 3rd 4Runner. I absolutely love this vehicle. It handles nicely and has plenty of room inside.

In comparison to the ford and the chevy it had about the same power but more pick up and go in the 4runner. Size wise its about the same.,The rear window is power so in the summer its going to be nice to put that down and get some air flow.,A little nicer interior its about the same boringness of the competitors but its still dull
4.875,Truly the best vehicle I ever bought,jimmy2x ,12/11/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Well - this is my 1st SUV.  Was purchased pretty much for cross-country traveling.   Rides much better than expected given that it is body-on-frame with a solid rear axle. Of course that is what gives the 4Runner true off-road capability which includes true 4-wheel LO with the ability to lock up the axles.   Excellent tracking in rain and snow with at least a reasonable chance of getting out if you foul up and get stuck.  Leather seats are comfortable and multi-adjustable.  Good visibility and the LTD comes with a back-up camera that plays thru the nav system for a decent view behind you.  Rear hatch closes electrically once you get close to avoid slamming.  Not a rattle or a squeak ,"NO rattles or squeaks.  Electric rear window.  Heated  seats.  Very smooth ride on the highway.  Compass in rear-view mirror.  Nav has a good sized screen with adjustments for brightness and color.  A bit daunting to learn for an ""old guy"", but I'm getting there.  JBL stereo.  Steering wheel controls.","The dial type climate controls are a gimmick that is a pain - you really have to hunt for the right point to push. More standard slide and turn type switches easier.  More lighted switches - knew this when I bought and have learned my way by ""feel"", but better interior lighting would be helpful."

It's a V6 Sport Package and it looks mean with that hood scoop! The car does its work how SUV should. The power is great the comfort is great just took it hunting and off road so it's a good piece of machine. I would recommend this SUV over any American made SUV!",Sport Package. Slide down rear glass.,Toyota don't ever take out the sliding glass in the back out!
5,This thing is amazing...,Dbone ,11/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have owned a few vehicles in my time and nothing comes close to matching the overall quality and purchase experience I have gotten with the Runner.  I went with the limited V8.  Oh so smooth and quiet and not a single rattle...  Handles unbelievably with the XREAS.  Gas mileage more than reasonable for the smoothness, quietness and capability provided. Have had it for almost a year now and my feeling is that I will be able to keep this thing for my planned minimum 10 years easy. I can not say enough about this truck... very attached to it :-)  I considered a new Pathfinder.  Not the same vehicle for sure.  Could have gotten a much better deal on the Nissan but just couldn't do it.","Smooth quiet riding, impeccable build quality, XREAS, self-leveling rear suspension for towing.","Seats could be better but not bad, had worse. Once I took the time to adjust them appropriately they were more than fine. This truck is as close to perfect for the money that I have been able to ever find."

Very well behaved and comfy on and off road, tried to spin the tires on the dirt but couldn't due to traction control, just launched (scary).  Head room is limited but will learn to live with it (I'm only 5'10"").  We will keep this rig for a very long time.  ","Sun roof and rear window, V8, Galactic Gray paint, cup holders that a Nalgene bottle will fit in (still need one more for the wifes and my coffee).  Plenty of leg room in the back seats for adults.

4.625,I love it - BUT,Colesmom ,11/03/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I replaced my 2002 Ford Explorer with a 2008 4Runner SR5. I got about the same vehicle, options wise, with the exceptions that the explorer had leather and a 6 disc CD system and was about $10,000 less new.  Although I love the way the 4Runner looks, it doesn't have as much head room, the double decker cargo system is a pain, and you cannot touch the vehicle without scratching it. (Try keeping your kids from touching it.) It's also harder to reach the backseat from the front. ",I love the way it looks. It rides good with little noise.,A standard power outlet in the back passenger area would be more helpful than the one in the cargo area. 
5,Exceptional Vehicle for the Money,Doug Dolde ,10/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I traded a Jeep Liberty for this SR5 4x4 V8 4Runner and man what a difference.  This vehicle rides like a Lexus on the highway and it also rides extremely well on dirt forest roads here in Arizona.  Don't know why I waited so long to get one.,V8 engine has gobs of power but I still average 20.5 mpg.  The ride is incredible as well.,Instrument panel is a bit dated.
4.625,Great Value,davek49 ,09/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,4,"I chose the 4Runner Sport V6 RWD based on reliability and looks despite the RAV4 Sport V6 getting better gas mileage and sports-car like performance. This is my first SUV (on my 9th car in 17 years of driving) and I am getting used to sitting high up and the car with more of a truck-like feel (Tacoma versus the RAV4).  Keep in mind my view is based on previously driving an Audi A3 and BMW 3.  The Galactic Gray Mica is beautiful and I get compliments (brighter with blue sparkle than most dull grays).  The V6 has plenty of power for urban driving and I get a respectable 22mpg hwy (19.5 mpg mixed). The X-REAS suspension works very well, providing for a comfortable ride on twisty roads. ","Lots of trunk space, sunroof, Galactic Gray paint. X-REAS suspension. I also like the cupholders, which really can hold large bottles.","Lowering the height by 2 to 3 inches (very close to roof in some parking garages).

Wow, this is it, the best true SUV.  When I was ready to replace my '97 LT 2WD Chevy Tahoe I looked and test drove a bunch of vehicles. After driving the 4Runner for an extended tested drive I knew it was the truck for me.  The V6 performs so well in so many areas, the truck is laid out perfectly and thoughtfully, and at 6'-5"" and 280 I'm very comfortable. It is awesome on the highway, very quiet, very solid and plenty of power.  Lots of compartments to stowaway stuff.  I am set for canoing, fly fishing, biking and camping.","The off-road capabilities.

We recently towed our Lund 1750 Fisherman (2500 lbs with motor and trailer) 525 miles and averaged 17.5 mpg.  Most of that was in 4th gear, using overdrive only when going on level or down hill roads.  AND, that was into a headwind going to the cabin and a strong cross wind coming back.  Pretty amazing.  What impressed us the most was the stability of the truck and trailer rig.  Not once did a semi-truck passing in the other direction on 2-lane roads shake the 4Runner.",Please see review dated 11/24/2007 entitled A Worthy Investment.

4.625,2008 Urban Runner,dcrogers11 ,07/10/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Purchased Urban Runner Sport edition because of the overall appearance and option package.  After 1000 miles, I have enjoyed the driving experience.  The Blizzard Pearl color really stands out.  The xreas stability control is not just a gimmick, but gives a safer feel to handling.  MPG has been running from 20.5 to 22.7.  I drive 65-70 mph with 80% hwy driving.  Bluetooth function paired nicely with my iPhone and works well.  Tomtom was a big letdown.  Don't buy the UR package for the Tomtom.  Instead opt for the nav option in a Sport or Limited.  It cost more, but if GPS guidance is what you're looking for spend more for the nav/backup option.  V6 engine has good acceleration for a 4.0.","Handling, MPG, ride.  Will change my own oil thanks to nifty idea on oil filter/drain idea.  Like the overall looks of the UR package and the pearl really stands out over standard white 4runner.  Use my phone a lot and Bluetooth option is great.",Tomtom used in UR is outdated tech.

The new 4Runner is futuristic enough, while still maintaining the DNA of the original generations.  The solid construction, ""never-die"" dependability, and fun driving attitude make it a joy to drive. It's as if I'm back in the '94, but this time, with all the power I've ever wanted with 270 HP, and 300+ ft/lbs of torque.

Every safety feature worked flawlessy, saving my life.  I feel there would have been a much more tragic result if I had been driving any other vehicle.  The other driver survived as well, but then again she was driving a tank.  I plan on buying a brand new 4Runner this weekend and will be a loyal 4Runner owner for life!

I miss the room from my truck but am tickled with the gas mileage improvement and the the sr5 drives and handles great on and off road.  The ride is quiet and smooth while still being a true truck based vehicle.  I am quite happy.  The vehicle I got happened to have a moon roof.

If you want the nice features like lit-up window/lock/mirror controls on the door or a simple garage door opener, you better pony up a few more bucks.  ","Safety features like stability control, ABS, side bags and curtains. Nice ride and again, Toyota reliability, and higher than average resale.","For a vehicle in this price range, it could at least have a compass!  Seriously, throw in some creature comforts and a  vinyl case for the owner's manual."
5,A Worthy Investment,4RunnerKen ,11/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Its all in the details.  This 100% Japanese-made wonder is exactly what those who appreciate automotive excellence in engineering are looking for.  From the convex mirrors on the D pillars so you can see what or who might be approaching as you think about backing out into the parking lane, to the 3 jets in each of the two windshield washer spigots on the hood, to the extra compartment in the glove box, to the oil filter on the 4.0 liter V-6 located on the top of the engine, to the quality of the leather on the seats, to the built-in trash bag holder on the rear of the console, to the wonderfuly quiet ride and smooth suspension.  It is all so very impressive.  We couldn't be more pleased.",X-REAS suspension (opt on Limited) which flattens out corners; QV Limited Value package; flattest folding rear seat (models w/o 3rd row); lights on running boards; distinctive black wood- grain; Nav with backup camera; tilt & telescoping wheel; lots of torque; LED taillights; factory trailer hitch.,"Better lighting of foot wells & switches on doors; the 115-volt outlet and MP3 jack could be repositioned (almost need a flashlight to find them in the console); driver information center needs more contrast, esp. during the day.  Buying advice:  get 4Runner all-weather mats from dealer for winter."
4.75,Great Choice,Bob S ,11/11/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Had a '96 4Runner and decided to get another, the 2008 Limited 4WD. The only Japanese SUV with a solid axle - I tow a 3000 lb boat. The 6 has lots of pep for towing on the weekends. I don't feel like I've given up any towing by not getting the 8 (but I bet the 8 can really tow) and benefit from good mileage during the week. The car is solid, nav and Bluetooth are excellent. Backup camera allows me to line up the tow hitch, a valuable option for me. I did remove all the 4Runner badging - one of the only Toyotas to have the badging on the sides of the car. AC controls are Gameboyish, but I keep the Auto climate control on all the time (even when towing), so don't use them.",Engine (6) and solid axle.,More sophisticated badging and interior climate controls.
5,Great mid size RWD SUV,Wyatt ,10/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Im very happy with my 4Runner and with a little tweaking plus a few accessories I will like it even more.  Hopefully the TRD supercharger will be available soon.  So far (three tanks) my mileage has been slightly better than advertised which is always a pleasant surprise. ,"Bumper to bumper full length ladder frame with the bodys robust front, side and rear crumple zones plus the roof corners are heavy gauge steel and feel solid. Four piston front brake calipers, active headrests,fast navigation system with plenty of extras. Excellent paint finish and body panel fit.","Illuminate or back light all the power window and door lock buttons on all the doors and the information/climate control display could be about 10% larger. The steering wheel rim could be a tad thicker in diameter, and the navigation system could use a 7-11 band graphic equalizer."
