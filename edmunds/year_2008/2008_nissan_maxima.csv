After reading reviews on how horrible this car is on hitting bumps in the road. I came to the conclusion that as long as your not hitting bumps at excessive speeds just like any car its perfect. The design of the exterior is real classy with a sports car feel. The interior is comfortable and there is a few pieces that I think could be made alot better but that comes along with any car.

2.75,Not even close to a sports car!,Hatedit ,07/01/2009,,,4,2,4,3,,1,4,3,1,This model is marketed as a sports sedan.  Don't be fooled.  The transmission can't figure out what gear to be in.  It takes several seconds to figure out to downshift.  You can confuse it by using the manual shift mode.  It reacts with disdain at any aggressive driving.  The brakes fade and shudder with excessive use.  It handles like a cow.  Torque is completely absent.  The turning ration is terrible as is fuel economy.  The chrome wheels peel with only one winter.  Expect to visit the dealer with many problems with ignition sensors & check engine lights.  I traded a 2000 Maxima which was a completely different car.  Check out that trade-in value! Nissan will NEVER get my business again.,Nice creature comforts inside.,Return to your roots.  This car needs a soul.

Turning and keyless entry takes some getting use to.,"Roominess of cabin, quality of workmanship and materials.","Voice activated navigation system and shorten up the turn radius, add a back up camera instead of sensors."
4.875,Precision Grey  Max SL,beavis ,04/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Recently purchased a SL with the platinum package (no sunroof).  There was too much wind noise with the roof - even with the wind deflector.  I drove just about everything out there and this seemed the best bang for the buck.  I highly recommend the Platinum package ...    you feel like you purchased a luxury car.  This car is fast.  I am coming off a 540i.  While the max has more body roll than I am used to, this does the job for about half the money.  In the first week of having the car, I got my first ticket.  When your cruising at 80 mph, it really feels like 50mph.  Gas mileage is at 21.  For mileage cars, Honda and Nissan is where its at.  Toyota will put you to sleep.","Bluetooth, Xenon headlights, slick CVT, seats are very comfortable, cost, fast car.  ",Gas mileage needs to be increased.  Get rid of body roll.  Turning radius.  
4.75,Excellent car,Joe ,04/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,Got a great deal on this car and am glad I purchased. The only thing I didn't like is the small storage compartments are hard to get at. Everything else is great and very quick. It will get away from you if not careful. Overall I rate a 9.5,I like the automatic seat positioning. My wife drives it and her seat is completely different than mine. Works great,Maybe the center section storage compartment should slide forward so easier to access. I know some cars do this.
4.5,Nice car- Maxima SL,JTC ,03/28/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I have had my Maxima since Jan. and I am very pleased. Seemed to be the best value I could find in its class. Got it maxed out with all the toys. I got the SL because it had more of a luxury ride than the SE, coming out of a Lexus it suited me better. It is more sporty to drive but not as smooth (boring) as the Lexus.  This is a lot of car for the money and man does it move!","Nav system and dash, CVT, acceleration, bose system and leather interior, styling.","Touch screen navigation, rear vision, The torque steering at heavy acceleration takes a little getting use to but I do not mind it, its actually kind of fun."
3.5,Not as good as you'd think,Tombo123 ,03/12/2008,,,4,5,2,2,,5,4,2,4,"Wind noise, streaking wipers, creaking/binding sounds, headlight misalignment, right rear seat continually falls forward even though it's locked, air entering passenger compartment from somewhere up front, left front door handle had to be replaced as FOB signal failed, poor AM radio reception. Only item dealership repaired satisfactorily was the door handle. Averaging 14 mpg yet I travel on hwys 80% of the time. Our Altima was far superior MPG wise. CVT grinds between 30 & 40 mph. ","Hands-free telephone (Bluetooth) and entering vehicle does not require either a key or FOB in your hand. Excellent DOLBY sound. 17"" tires a plus. Superb power, great styling, holds road great, Bluetooth excellent, Homelink vastly improved.",Improve mfg quality and service quality.
5,Maxima - Better than Accord or Camry!,Kim ,02/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased a 2008 Maxima-SE withh Platinum Edition Package 3 months ago.  It is the perfect combination of sport & luxury.  It feels sportier than the Toyota Camry, and more refined than the Honda Accord.  I chose the ""SE"" because I like the brushed aluminum accents (versus the wood-tone accents in the ""SL"").  I like the way the car handles - except it does have a larger turning radius than some other vehicles in this class.  The Platinum Edition Package adds many great options.  The heated steering wheel is great on cold mornings!  Seats are comfortable.  CVT keeps the ride smooth while accelerating.  I even considered the Lincoln MKZ before deciding that the Maxima was the overall winner.","Great exterior styling.  Everyone comments on the ""SkyView Roof"" and how impressive the car looks overall.  I like the cornering lights, which illuminate in the direction of the turn signal.  Power folding side mirrors when going through tight spaces.  2-Driver memory settings are much-appreciated.",The climate control system is a bit awkward.  The heated seats don't get as hot as my other vehicle.  No major improvements needed!
5,"Fun, Fun, and more Fun!!!",kitkat ,02/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is very roomy for a family of four but yet sporty enough to satisfy the desires of most sports car enthusiast. I am very impressed with the power and agility of this car.  I considered the Honda Accord, but overwhelmingly chose the Maxima due to its interior room, comfortable seats, and power. This car is fun to drive!!  ","Comfortable leather seats, passenger leg room, powerful engine, trunk size, CVT is awesome for passing,and superb handling. ",The car has 1000 miles and averages around 25mpg. I would like to see a more fuel efficient engine without sacrificing horsepower or performance
5,New Maxima,Bill ,01/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I currently own a 2004 and now a 2008.  Love both cars, the new CVT took a little time getting used to, very smooth much different than the 2004.  Fuel mileage is about the same in both 22-25 mpg highway.",Style of the car and how it performs.  Seats four adults great plenty of leg room for passengers.,"Nissan wont allow the bose radio system with cloth interior. My 04 has the bose system and it was cloth, Nissan your missing the boat on this one think about how much money your losing not allowing bose, navigation with cloth interior."
4.875,Best deal in its class.,al ,01/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is my Max but I've known the blood line since the Datsun 710 and 810 days. I have to warn you, that CVT is quick. Yes I did have some reservation about CVT and performance. This car put that to rest. I was in the market for a TL Avalon and considered an Accord but after crunching the numbers and the grim factor the Max won hands down. This car has one issue however, it's happiest when pushed, say at a RPM of about 27+. The acceleration is quick, seamless and the braking system assures you all is well, in the event you need to calm youself down. I would opt for the VDC over the TCS, just my opinion. I commute in an area with a lot of hills and this car make those hills disappear. ","Remote that opens roof and windows. Nav and Bose audio. Beefy 18"" tires. Power mirrors with auto dimming. Xenon lights high/low beams. The trunk is crazy. The new rear spoiler was an improvement over 07. The heated bucket seats, leather, firm, I love the feel on the turns. Oh, the smile.","Well, I don't known, maybe Xenon fogs. Well that's not important. Let me see, hmmmm. Oh yeh, the Am / Fm reception could be improved. I like the idea of the Tiptronic shift, but I don't really use it. I got it, I would like to see Nissan make a manual gear box available."
5,My view,jhbodie72 ,12/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is my first new car and I absolutely love it. I am a family man but this car is still a sport car. I just bought the 08 se model and I have no complaints. Sexy yet within my budget. I think it performs outstanding and looks better than everything in its class.,Performance and looks.,None yet but I just got it. My model is base but loaded enough for me. I added an aftermarket navigational system and iPod and I am done.
4.5,A Bit Disappointed,Raymond ,12/11/2007,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,4,4,"I've loved Maximas ever since I first test drove one in 1995. I then went on to own a '92 Maxima, '98 Maxima, '03 Infiniti I35 (Maxima in disguise) and now this 2008 Maxima. I feel that this 2008 Maxima is probably the worst of all the other cars I've owned. Having bought this car new I have already noticed light engine ping which is downright annoying. I have used all premium fuel grades and the car still pings lightly. This is my major gripe with this car. Nissan of course says that it is normal. On a more positive note; the CVT will impress you with its quickness and eerie sense of moving the car very quickly at a very low ""fuel saving"" RPM. But in the end, I should've bought an Avalon.","Navigation, automatic folding mirrors, bi-level xenons that can actually illuminate a short building's roof line, cornering lights, Bluetooth. PSI meter on screen with the navi option, awesome & clean sounding Bose stereo and awesome I-key.","Make engines that do not ping at all, improve gas mileage."
5,Love my maxima,tucker ,12/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I own a 2008 maxima se. This is my second maxima, I had a 2001 and traded it.  I love the comfort the style and I always get a nice comment on my maxima.  I will have this maxima for a long time I finally got the loaded one.","interior, style and look of car",no suggestions
5,Amazed,Pags98 ,11/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I must say that I wasn't looking to purchase a Maxima but when I found I could get a similarly equipped Maxima for almost the same price as an Altima I was intrigued.  I've loved every minute that I drive in this vehicle (and I drive a ton).  I've had it for 2.5 weeks now and have driven 1800 miles.  I constantly compare it to other cars I see and my friends, many of whom have high end Mercedes, BMWs and Infinitis, cannot believe the features/capabilities of a car that costs a fraction of what theirs cost.  The seats are great, the interior controls are easily accessible and the keyless entry/start is fantastic.  I'm averaging about 23.8 MPG so far.","Keyless entry, interior controls, comfortable seats, interior space, well-lit displays, turning light.",None
4.625,Maxima SE,steve ,11/26/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,3,5,"I looked at just about every entry level luxury car there was out there.  328xi, lexus 350, infiniti g35, saab 9.3, audi a4, mercedes c300.  All had the same thing in common, did not offer anything more than the Maxima except AWD, most looked nearly identical! All the same features for less money.  I cannot see why people would pay thousands more for a car that is so close to the Maxima.  I am a former Cadillac, Lincoln and BMW owner.  I chose the SE, this is more sporty without the wood accent.  This is an entry luxury car without the price tag.  Without the name plate either but I can say one statement.  I saw all the other cars and could have bought them instead, I love my new Maxima.",My favorite feature is the telescopic steering wheel and the features on the bluetooth phone.  The memo pad in particular.  Oh and the price tag for so much car.,"Offer an AWD model, this nearly made me not buy this car.  "
4.875,2008 Nissan Maxima,BriGuy ,11/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Wow! I just traded in my 2006 Honda Accord because I was bored out of my mind and sick of getting passed on the highway.  Now I do the passing!  I say this car is for guys or girls that like a whole lot of performance to go along with their luxury.  I got a fully loaded one (minus nav) and it is by far the nicest car I have ever owned.  You have to get the leather and the Bose sound system amazing.  I know Zoom-Zoom belongs to Mazda but they might have stolen it from Nissan.,"Leather interior, Bose sound system, a super responsive engine with CVT that gives you all you ask for and more.","Gas isn't bad. I am getting about 21 city/highway mixture, could be a little better and it takes premium gas. On the website it says 20 gal tank, it's really only 15 gal. Ride can be a little rough but that's because of the 18"" rims. Really there's nothing bsd about this car just things to keep in mind."
4.875,Performance/Luxury Sedan,Ken Harris ,11/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The Maxima is an excellent choice in this price range fully loaded. I purchased the SE model fully loaded except for navigation. The 3.5 liter Nissan v6 is one of the best in the market. The CVT has extremely smooth operation with no feel of any downshifting or lag time. The ride is fairly smooth and road noise is minimal. The interior design is well constructed and overall I am very happy with the purchase. I have owned 3 Maximas previously, 1990, 1999 and 2001. Nissan has come a long way over the years. I plan to keep the 2008 Maxima for a very long time!!",Sonar parking with adjustable rear view mirrors which assists in parallel parking. The leather seats are high quality along with Bose stereo. The 18 inch tires grip the road very nicely. ,The turning radius is too long. There is also some torque steer if you accelerate too hard. 
5,So far so good...,Maximagirl48 ,11/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had this car for only a week now, but very impressed! I traded in a 2002 Max which I loved. I am falling in love all over again with the 2008!  The CVT needs time to get used to but nonetheless shifting is a smooth transition. I have had no problem with the car staying in line. I love all the bells & whistles such as the heated seats & steering wheel, HID lights, Bluetooth, compass, large roomy trunk & interior, information center, & plug-in capability. It appears to like the mid-grade gas as opposed to the regular (much smoother). Haven't tried the premium in it yet. Luxury & sport at a reasonable price-you can't beat that!  As I get more miles on this I will update with fuel mileage.","Smart Key - doesn't even have to be in your hand!; heated steering wheel; HID lights; power side mirrors; CVT; leather seats with lumbar support; very deep center console storage; 6-CD changer; XM satellite radio; roomy interior, comfortable enought to fit a large golden retriever.",Better turning radius.  Possible AWD??? Yokohama Avid Tires as OE.  Otherwise none!
4.75,Great Car,wk2design ,10/30/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Overall - great car. I'm very pleased after almost buying an Acura and Saab. The Maxima has it all and more.  Best thing - go for the leather - awesome seats and comfort.  Performance - just test drive one and you'll see.  Price is high although worth it when compared to others.  BTW - The Audi A4 and Passat are both slugs compared to the Maxima.,Keys and auto open/start.,Improve front dash board. Install dash hidden storage. 
5,Still the king,Topper ,09/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Every 2-3 years I trade my vehicles in.  So far out of the last 6 vehicles I have owed, 3 have been Maximas (and for good reason).  The first one I bought was a '93 that I loved.  I traded it for a new V6 Honda Accord that I drove for 2 years missing my Maxima daily. '97 I finally traded the Accord back in for a new Maxima that I loved.  Back and forth, back and forth, you get the idea!  Maxima has always been a true sign of style and class which has never meet an equal w/in its price range. With its quick speed, smooth ride, and stylish looks, the Nissan Maxima will always remain my favorite vehicle to own in any price range.  Thank you Nissan!!    ","Stylish looks, bluetooth, stereo, back seat leg room, nav, and I know this is going to sound silly but I love the Homelink the most!","If I had to ask Nissan to address an issue that I had w/the Maxima it would be to please make a 2-dr Maxima (and no, the Altima coupe does not count, sorry Nissan).
