Its fast, handles great, great seats, front visibility is good, the brembo brakes are awesome, the nismo wheels look great - 18"" in the front and 19"" in the back, the stock exhaust is just right.  Yes the bose stereo could be better and there should be an aux input.  There is some road noise but I love the sound it makes and feeling the road, I wanted a sports car and I got a great one!

I think the car is well balanced for the price, but a few thousand dollars in the right areas and you have a very competitive handling car with a good driver experience inside.The motor is a thing of beauty. Stock sound and power is plenty to get up to high speeds - 90-130+, although I believe the suspension and wheels need to be upgraded to fully realize the VQ35HR's potential.The exterior styling is timeless and I really like the hood on the HR (07/08) models. HID projectors are a classy touch that provide excellent visibility.I love this car. It is a visceral machine with an unmistakable racing DNA.

If the standard 350Z isn't good enough for you get a 370Z or NISMO.

The performance, styling and fuel economy are excellent and I'm sure the reliability will be the same.  Although I didn't buy from my local dealer (due to them not having the exact car I wanted (base 6M w/out splash guards), they are eager to service it.

I got the grand touring so it's supposed to be an upgrade with the Bose. How can you not have a iPod connector for it?  I hate the fm transmitters.

The trunk can be useless.  If those are not an issue, get this car!  The engine is fabulous and handles spectacularly.

The 2 are very similar interior wise, power wise, and that is where it ends.  The nismo, is a much more aggressive/racing type car, yes you can travel, the gas mileage is comparable if you can keep your foot out of it!  Good luck with that.  The car handles like a dream, you can push it to the edge of your own limits and it still wants more, the stiffer chassis, and upgraded suspension make this car worth the little extra it costs to own, over a normal Z.  If you like to drive, and love the road this car is for you!!!  If not then I suggest a normal Z.

Cons: poor gas mileage, no telescoping steering wheel, road noise, strange rattle over bumps, poor visibility. All things considered, its a great car. The fun factor far makes up for any imperfections. It feels like a true sports car. It has this ""brute power"" kind of feeling.

Everytime you get in it feels like your going to an auto X.  I test drove an STI, G35, and RSX's before I found this, and I beleive it is the fastest and best handling out of the 3.   The performance is excellent, hands down.  The interior is ok.  Not fancy because things like leather and power seats add weight.  The car has been purpose built.  Its also very bumpy ride, because of the seam welded body.  However if you like that feeling of being connected to the road like me you will love this.   The exhaust roars FYI too.  I tell people it runs on diced lions.","Handling, speed.  (306 HP 268 TQ is more than enough for regular road driving.  I still find myself accidently spinning the wheels every once in a while.)  Looks great.  Aero kit looks good and is functional over 60 MPH.  Seamwelded body.  Like the rims on the Nismo as well.  Interior acceptable.

It turns heads from the young to the old. At first I did not like the color (Solar Orange) but it quickly grew on me and I have had a ton of compliments. The only reason I got that color is because it was the only 2007 on the lot at the time and I did not want to wait to get it. I have wanted this car for the past 4 years and I am so happy I did.
