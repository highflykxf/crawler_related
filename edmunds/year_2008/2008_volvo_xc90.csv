For example, the ignition switch had to be replaced.The right and left side of the seat panel had to be replaced because the plastic cracked. The sunroof leaked. This doesnt cover all the other issues of the S60.Without exaggeration, this is the most we have ever been inside of a service station.

More surprising is the repeat replacement issue. Vovlo doesn't seem to be concerned as there is no public discussin regarding design or manufacturing changes, even for the new models. I fully believe the only reason Volvo has not recalled the vehicle for faulty trany (replacement) is because they haven't been able to link fatalities to the issue. Based on what I am reading and what I am hearing, its only a matter of time. I am very surprised the Luxury Car manufacturer has not taken a more proactive position on this and dealers are very difficult to work with.",great internal engineering.

I would most probably come back to close the deal with him after the appointment.   After a test drive of Volvo XC90, I changed my mind right away.  The car felt smooth, sturdy, and macho, having an excellent road grip at highway curves.  I have driven the car for almost 5 months since then and never had a problem with its workmanship.  Believe it or not, it is also a head turner on highway. One major complaint I have about the car is gas mileage, so far I have 14.8 m/g.

The ride is a bit stiff but that does help the handling. Overall, it is an easy to handle car, but one does notice it is big and heavy. The AWD keeps it on the road all the time and it doesn't flip/ flop turning corners as much as other SUV's. But it does a bit the tendency to go straight when turning corners, probably based on it being a primairily FWD based car. The 3.2 is a nice engine, with enough power to handle the car and a full load of passengers and luggage. I can imagine with the weight of the car that the V8 would be a lot nicer to drive, although the mileage will be even worse.

How do they sell those things? The Volvo leather on my premium is sumptuous, the materials and design are great, and the ride responsive but quiet with no wind noise.  In short, It's a great ride.

Stop crying about fuel economy, put your family in a Prius if that's important to you, if you want a truly safe, well built, nice looking SUV this is the truck for you!  Remember you get what you pay for, there's a reason that this truck is over $50,000 without things like navigation and rear view cameras, because you are paying for safety!  This is another of those ""imports"" that you can buy and still buy American, Volvo is a proud member of the Ford Motor Company!","Wood steering wheel, 6 speed auto, awesome exterior styling, 18"" wheels, 311hp, tons of torque, 3 rows of seating, rear AC, many many cup holders, American owned (Ford motor company), ample interior space, drives a lot smaller than it's substantial and heavy size. Adjustable 2nd row seats (sliding).","Standard navigation, power folding mirrors, power folding third row seats, continue the awesome real wood accents throughout the cabin, projector headlights! Offer an extended wheel base (e.g. Mercedes GL Class).  Although the 311hp is nice a diesel option would be economical for green cry babies. "
3.375,I think I got hoodwinked,Nervous Wife ,03/08/2008,,,5,5,1,1,,3,4,3,5,"Always wanted a Volvo XC90.  Bought one.  Very happy when delivered.  Thought I got a safe and reliable tank!  Wrong!  The car broke and was towed to the dealership after one week of ownership.  It is now back in my garage.  How do you feel when you shelled out 40k for a SUV that breaks this early in your ownership?  I now keep my fingers crossed.  Read your state's Lemon Law.  I did.  I hope I won't need it.  I like this car, but...","Excellent looks, outstanding interior.  Luxurious but simple.  Just enough perks inside and out.  Gives you a ""safe"" feeling. ","How about better quality control?  Why are these things breaking so early?  When I say early, during the first month of ownership?"
2.375,Over Rated ,Carl ,02/27/2008,,,3,3,1,1,,4,4,1,2,"We have owned this vehcile less than 60 days and have had to have the front right blinker light replaced( cracked at factory),  have replaced the cam shaft value as it ""popped off"" leaving a large oily mess and the 90 portion of the XC90 emblem on the back had to be straightened as it was installed crooked at the factory. We are averaging 17 miles per gallon and this is FWD ! We did get a ""good"" deal based on the over $40K sticker price and final price of $36,250 with dealer cash and X plan discount. This is our first Volvo and may be our last. Traded our Infiniti and have had second thoughts many times. ","Wooden Steering Wheel, Heated seats, Real wood trim throughout front portion of the cabin. Fairly Quiet","Gas Mileage, Factory quality control, Needs a compass"
4.625,Perfect car but not enoying it,Thor ,11/17/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,4,My family has had a Volvo since 1981 and therefore it was not a difficult choice to purchase the XC90. The interior is typical Volvo (little bit too tight) but with the highest quality to find. All seats are strong and comfortable - not just the front seats as in some other SUVs.,The beautiful and complete design of the interior and the assurance that you are sitting in a very save car.,Easier access to third row might be improved (compared to the Mazda CX9).
4.875,Movin' up,USNav8tor ,11/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I recently traded my '06 BMW M3 convertible in for this SUV.  I needed the space for our new baby.  My rating is slightly lower on performance and fun to drive just based on the fact I have a hard time not comparing it to the M3 - totally different vehicles, but I'm still having a little separation anxiety.  I do love this SUV. I did my research and really found this to be the best bang for the buck and it is.  I have been a german car owner and vowed to never buy anything else... well Volvo won me over!  The Volvo XC90 is fantastic!",The comfort and size are very impressive.  The safety ratings and feature are hands down one of the best out there.  I love the built in booster seat for the little one in the near future.,"I was a little shocked at how poor the gas mileage is and having to use premium gas is really a killer. They offer a maintenance plan for purchase, it's a minimal cost in the big picture and worth it, however, it would be nice if it was included!  "
5,Scandinavian Delivery,bobliles ,09/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We picked up the car at the Volvo delivery center in Goteberg, Sweden and drove to Oslo, Lillehammer, over the mountains to Balestrand, back through Sweden, Karlstad, Stockholm, Kalmar.  Climbing the mountains was no effort for the V8 and was unaffected by the altitude.  We drove 1700 miles in ten days. The only challenge was parking in an Oslo underground garage meant for the dimunitive European vehicles.  Mileage for trip was 23.8 mpg which is excellent considering the mountain and in city driving. But minimum octane in Norway/Sweden was 95. I've been a Honda/Acura owner for 30 years. Owned an MDX and test drove a new MDX recently.  The Volvo XC90 is the ultimate. ",I can't imagine a car being more comfortable than the XC90. I wish they made couches.,Price is steep but then so is the BMW X5 and MDX.  I would add keyless entry.
4.75,"Volvo is Swedish for ""fill her up again""",navydocwv ,09/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I love my new 2008 XC90, but with only a V6, I thought I would get a little better gas mileage.  I am averaging 13 MPG. (My guess is that it is such a safe and heavy car from all the steel in it.)  I got better gas mileage in my V8 Dodge Durango which was a larger SUV.  Other than the gas mileage, this car is cream of the crop and will turn heads.  I got the Willow Green which is a great color.",The high quality leather.,Don't know how they would do it but my #1 suggestion would be improve the gas mileage (gas is not cheap these days)!!
5,Outstanding Vehicle!,Carrie ,08/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just took possession of my XC90 and love every minute behind the wheel.  The well appointed interior, comfortable seating and smooth and quiet ride makes this vehicle a joy to drive.  The XC90 exceeded my expectations.","Naturally, the high safety ratings are a big plus.  Also, the park assist is a great feature.",Include bluetooth in one of the packages instead of as a separate accessory.
5,2008 XC90 3.2 AWD,SYeard ,07/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Picked up the car at the beginning of July and its been happy driving from day one. The XC90 is a pleasure to drive with the 6 cylinder engine and the versatility of the 7 seat capability is a must for all active SUV owners. A very premium experience. ,Too many to mention though the BLIS and RTI navigation system is great.,
