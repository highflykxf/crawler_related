Huge mistake.  I just bought a used 2008 Solara SLE convertible with only 2,000 miles on it and it is wonderful.  It fits my 6'1 frame, drives beautifully and is really the perfect car.

The only issue I see is the rear view window should be bigger due to the huge blind spot.There is some road noise while driving, but it's a convertible. A/C works perfectly along with everything else. I can't say enough Wonderful things about this car, it's nothing but Pure Quality from Toyota!!

The angle of the clock etc, I wish it were slightly angled toward the driver,it's flat across the front and hard to see when driving, and the snap for the buckle is too deep by the seat,a struggle to snap the seat buckle into it, it should be a few inches longer.

Ride is a little noisy but it's a convertible. Other that that I love this car, smooth ride and with the top down it is the most fun car I have ever owned. Fits a family of four comfortably & I am lost without the nav. Besides normal maintenance have not had a problem since the day I rolled it off the lot, and I drive 150 miles a day.",NAV. Big trunk.

4.125,08 Solara SE 4 Hardtop,Rob from Martinsburg ,05/21/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I bought this car for a great price towards the end of February.  It's not the top of the line model but it has the moonroof, 6 disc, and the alarm system. Yes, there is some tranny lag and no, I haven't yet taken it in for the re-flash as I don't think that it will affect it much anyway.  I've found that the  slow shifts do not occur when the shifter is in manual shift mode & I'm having a blast shifting in manual through town and when merging. Gas MPG has improved @30 MPG combined with 4200 miles which is very acceptable being that my 05 XB gets 33 mpg. The Solara rides very smooth, the front strut tie bar keeps the front end flat and the trunk is huge. Headlights are great & cd display dim.","Seat comfort, ride, handling, and MPG.  I like that the gas tank is 18.5 gal for extended cruising.  Headlight distance is excellent.  Very quiet ride with the windows and roof closed.  Lighted Gauge display is cool and 6 disc is good for road trips. LED tail lights and the exterior styling superb.","Dim radio display, tranny lag, and no standard power seat on the SE model. USB input for the head unit should be standard. Rear seat armrest would be nice addition. Stock Michelin MVX4 tires are middle of the road performance at best. They don't grip particularly well in hard turns but ride smooth."
4.5,End of the line,GM ,04/08/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"I had reservations about buying a car I knew was no longer being manufactured.  However, there simply is not a convertible out there that provides the smoothness, comfort, feature set, and room anywhere near this price point.  And the close-out incentives were certainly compelling.  This car is not about driving excitement.  Freeway curves easily taken at 80 in my 3-series need to be adjusted down to 60 in the Solara.  Acceleration is good, but not dramatic.  However, everything about this car exudes refinement - whisper-quiet Lexus grade engine, solid thunk of the trunk, smooth switch gear, damped cup holder cover, efficient top mechanism.","Feels rich, high feature content, expected Toyota reliability, quiet, comfortable, roomy, smooth, night sky above","Massive blind spots, small rear window, need automatic panel to hide folded top mechanism (like my old Audi)"
4,Auto Trans lags badly,Torx55 ,01/14/2009,,,3,5,5,5,,1,4,4,5,"The auto trans is very very slow to downshift, in fact, there is at least a 2-3 second lag when you push the accelerator, to the power getting to the wheels. The motors revs then trans engages. Dealer loaded the new ECM software, but it made little if any difference. Dealer said he did all he could and the trans is considered fixed and normal by Toyota. Sure shocks me if Toyota engineers consider this normal. If you get one, be careful when pulling into traffic or when quick acceleration is necessary. The trans will scare you. I won't keep this Toyota for 150K miles as I did with the car I sold to get this 08. Very disappointing.","Exterior, quiet ride, looks.",Badly needs a redesigned auto trans.

5,Absolutely Red,Dadeo ,12/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Car is for my wife.  She wanted quiet, comfortable, sporty and spacious. Not an easy combination for a convrt under $30K. Tested: Sebring V6, Mustang V6 & VW Eos converts. Solara has best combination of space, features and price. This was 4th and last car we drove. She knew she wanted it at only 30 seconds into the test drive. Pluses 1. Top that does NOT fold down into fairly roomy trunk. You won't have to rearrange the contents of the trunk to put the top down. Ever. 2. Practically no engine and wind noise 3. Comfortable rear seating (true but hard to believe) 4. Solid comfortable ride & handling 5. Excelent ergos and cockpit for driver & front passenger 6. Peppy engine No Minuses","Toyota has a unique combination of workmanship, ergonomics, engine performance, handling and functionality. ","The boot that covers the top when it is down needs to be easier to install, remove and store. Make it out of a flexible material that rolls up, takes less space when not in use, and can be inserted into a long lasting protective cover that can be safely stored in trunk.

Love the car with the top down, but hate it with the top up because of the rattles in the back side windows, especially the passenger side).  On bumps or rough roads, the window sounds like it is going to fall out of track.  It started when I drove it off of the dealership lot and I was assured it would be fixed, but after several attempts to fix it, including shims being put in the back side window and a tear in the headliner while trying to fix it, I have now been told by the dealership and Toyota Corp. that there is nothing that can be done, that it is problem with this model.

I bought this car because of its room and style.  Fits four adults comfortably and also can fit three teens in the back (need to cross-over the seat belts).  I wish it had a little more pick up but hasn't been a problem.  Wish the driver seat had a memory for at least one driver.  Bluetooth for phone doesn't allow name of person calling to be programmed.

5,Lexus like,Gene ,08/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The test drive in the rain with the top up impressed me. The quietness and the solid, confidence inspiring handling were very impressive. Love the gauge illumination at night too. The 6's performance seems fine to me and great gas mileage too! Car trip with only 200 miles on the odo got 30+ mostly highway mpg at 70. Top down on the highway is fine too- not too much wind and able to talk in a normal tone w/o windscreen. The nav system is not as intuitive as my Garmin Nuvi but does have its pluses. Voice activation commands with the top down is iffy. Luckily this can be done manually. Radio is nice, rear visibility is ok with mirrors and seat adjusted properly. Tilt & tele wheel is great.","The top, the quietness, solid build and great handling feel like my former Lexus. Performance and gas mileage are great. Like the ability to lock the trunk and glovebox access and the valet key. Cool lit gauges. Comfortable multi adjusting front seats and roominess of the back seat.","Nav system-put a Garmin in!

Car was swapped for a duplicate model and we've been happy so far. Check the door for fit. Car drives very well but don't expect sporty speed or cornering - it's not that kind of car. Interior is well designed except for crummy cupholders. Love the aux jack and its location. Multifunction display is actually useful. Roof operates well but the lack of independent control for the rear windows is odd and annoying. Roof quality is excellent but the blind spot is larger than my previous convertibles.
