No GM car I've ever had can match that record. No car payment for the past four years and only cost has been regular oil changes. In eight years, changed the battery once and the tires once. Would buy again but the new model does not have the fold down front passenger seat.

Everything about this car is average: the interior, the exterior, the performance. Nothing impressive. But I have actually become a Kia fan because of the reliability. We've had this thing on several long road trips with no problems. Other than maintenance items and a transmission fluid change at 45k miles due to hard shifting this thing has never let us down. I have a rear-wheel drive V8 and am looking for an 4WD SUV for winter. I just might get a KIA Sportage of my own.",Reliability is the only thing I really like about this car but that makes everything else much more bearable.,"All of the improvements I'd recommend they've probably already done on the newer models of the Sportage. These include nicer interior, especially more comfortable seats. A more powerful engine and better handling. But like I said if you want a used SUV that is reliable I would definitely consider one of these."

I was looking at used cars and found this to be cheaper brand new than the used 4 cyl. 07 Ford Escape. I love the way it drives and it looks awesome. VERY SPORTY!!! My only complaints are the tires wore out around 20,000 miles and it cost around $700 to get 4 new ones! Kia told us that the tires for this vehicle are expensive and thats just the way it is. Gas mileage is my other complaint when i fist bought the car I was getting almost 23 on the highway and after replacing the tires with ""gas saver"" tires I now get about 19.5 highway.

I read reviews before purchasing but, worried about gas prices, still went with a 4 cyl. Not a day goes by that I don't wish I had paid the extra $800 for a 6 cyl. The interior is made with lots of rock hard plastic but, for the price, I would recommend this car to someone low on money yet desirious of an SUV.",LOVE LOVE LOVE the size of this little cutie. It is perfect for me and my daughter. The cargo space is nice; the rear seats go down so easily and perfectly flat.,The center console is laughable.

Outlander didn't have a light colored interior and was priced a bit higher so went w/the KIA and got it for the same price as a 2007.  I get 25-30 mpg(city to hwy). It has 18,700 miles and 3 oil changes on it.  Runs great, no problems. Good in snow,rain and mountains. I scaled down from a Windstar minivan and am very happy w/my choice!

We test drove the mazda 3, chev malibu and the honda civic but ended up buying an suv. It was less expensive than any of the other vehicles with just as many or more features.","We like the fact it has a 5 star safety rating. It looks great, rides nice, has lots of interior room and is quiet on the highway.",The center console could be longer so you could actually use it as an armrest. Maybe put the cruise on the steering wheel and put the rear wiper controls elsewhere.
5,Great Value,Joe in Chicago ,08/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We've had a 2005 Hyundai Elantra that gave us no issues at all, so we looked at the Tucson, but liked the more modern look and feel of the Kia Sportage.  Surprised at the tight fit and finish, and the nice interior does not really feel or look cheap.  Quiet cabin, great ride and beautiful paint and quality.  Lots of room and a very well put together vehicle.  Performance is actually OK in the 4-Cyl...I mean this isn't a racer but not what you buy these for anyway. It's more than adequate for ramps and merging and drives great on the highway.   ","All the luxuries, like Power Windows and locks, A/C tilt etc make this a great value, but the safety side Air Bags , Anti-Lock Brakes, Electronic Traction Control are the best. ","If I *had* to pick something to complain about, I guess the radio could use an upgrade. Better EQ Management and a USB for MP3 player would go a long way."
4,Needs Armrests,gourdy ,08/10/2008,,,2,5,5,5,,4,3,3,5,"Like the car but don't like the fact there are no front center arm rests. Would not buy again unless they improve that feature. Like everything else, great car.","Turning radius, luggage compartment, wide doors, plenty of leg room","Please, please include some front center arm rests in this car. Not a thing to stop one from falling over or to lean on. Car is wonderful except for that feature or lack thereof. Would stop me from getting another one."
5,Impressed,Love my Sportage ,08/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My daughter went looking for a new car in January.  She wanted a small SUV.  I talked her into looking at the KIA Sportage, mainly due to price and warranty.  She really didn't think she wanted a KIA, but to placate me, she decided to look at the Sportage.  She ended up purchasing a 6 cylinder LX and so did I!  We both love our Sportages.  They get better gas mileage than what is published.  They are fun to drive and very comfortable.  We are both very happy with our purchases!",Interior room,Door locks standard
5,Best vehicle I have ever owned!,SMA ,07/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"In 2006, our family purchased our first Sportage.  It was Jade Green and I loved it so very much.  Due to rising gas prices, we recently went on the lookout for a better commuter vehicle and, while impressed with the looks and mileage of the Kia compacts, we went right back to a new Sportage.  This one is silver gray and happily accepted by the whole family.  We love the safety it offers, the height, and the roomy interior.  I'm sure we will always go to the Kia Sportage as new vehicles are required by our family. My only issue is the ESC Off light came on as we drove it home from the dealership.  Will call immediately to have it fixed.","Very comfortable, roomy interior, great value on purchase price, contemporary, stylish exterior, Kia always offers excellent cash back and loyalty incentives","Offer an MP3 port standard (as on other Kia vehicles), I also agree with the reviews calling for rear air vent and audio controls on steering wheel"
4.75,Most bang for the buck,kiajerry ,05/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Best all-around and versatile vehicle i have ever owned. This is my third Kia, i already knew they are a great value. Can't wait till winter, this is my first all-wheel drive ride. The sportage is a nicer vehicle than my wife's '05 Mazda Tribute S. The only thing the Mazda has is a few more ponies. Way to go Kia!","Looks, sun roof, awd, fit and finish, smooth and quiet, 3 fold flat seats, storage space, warranty, handling","Audio controls on steering wheel, rear air conditioning outlet"
4.875,Best of SUVs,mtyszka1 ,04/10/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Great on gas, better than expected handling, and no defects as delivered, a first for me as a buyer.","Air is great, ride impressive equal to 50,000 SUVs driven while shopping. While Options are limited Value is incredible.",Should add GPS to list of luxury options
4.625,Nice get around town vehicle,azmark ,03/19/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,4,5,5,5,"Fuel mileage has been better than expected (27 MPG), performance with the 4 cyl a little sluggish, loud engine noise while cruising at freeway speed. Sensor light came on for ESC Off about 4 days after purchasing, finally getting fixed this week. Car feels a little cheaply made, but you get what you pay for. For purposes of getting around town, it's a nice enough vehicle. Would marginally recommend.","Fuel mileage, comfortable seats, stylish look","Handling a little stiff, noisy engine"
5,Surprisingly excellent purchase!,Jerry ,03/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"When shopping for an economy suv, our first choice based on reputation and suitability for our needs was the Toyota Rav-4.  But before we sank that kind of money into a vehicle, we thought we would look around at what else was available.  First stop, Kia place.  Last stop, Kia place.  We were very impressed with the ride, the performance, and the overall appeal of the Sportage, and it soon became apparent that there ain't no way the Toyota Rav-4 can possibly be worth the $4,000 to $5,000 more it costs than a comparable Kia Sportage!  And the frosting on the cake is the super gas mileage we get with the 4-cyl. engine with manual transmission.  Way to go Kia!","Roomy, comfortable interior, abundant standard features not expected on an economy car, excellent ride and handling characteristics, the fold up rear window and rear door, and the versatility of the vehicle in general.","Fit and finish aren't exactly perfect, but you have to look real close to find a few minor imperfections."
5,Love my Sportage!,kcarson ,02/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have always been a Toyota guy but when looking to trade out of my aging Toyota 4Runner I thought I owed it to myself to do a little research. At every turn I ended up right back on Kias door step. With a lot of reluctance I decided to give the Sportage a test drive. Thats all it took. The ride and handling of this vehicle coupled with the overall price and warranty (standard mind you) and a resale value that now stood up to the big dogs it was a no brainer.  I would have to say to Kia , keep up the great work! Your hard work and attention to quality and detail is now starting to get the recognition it deserves",This is a go anywhere vehicle with surprisingly roomy interior space and the drive and handling you would expect from a sports car.,
5,Absolutely A Great SUV,Angela ,01/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was reluctant to consider KIA as a car that I would purchase. I went to the dealership by chance. Only to be sold on the beautiful looks of the Royal Jade Green Sportage. It looks comparable to the other SUVs in its class but a lot more affordable with the cost of fuel these days. It is surprisingly roomy and had most of the features I wanted in a vehicle in regards to safety for the family. I have 3 girls, 2 of which are teenagers and one in a car seat, and I was very surprised to see that my kids fit well in the back seat with no complaining. I think that it has more interior room than my 2007 Dodge Ram quad cab. I would highly recommend the KIA, as they have come a long way. Love it!","I love the fold flat seats, including the front passenger seat and how they are covered with plastic. I love how it corners and handles likt a sports car. I love all the standard options. I have the LX 2.0 4 cyl version and it is perfect for a get around town car. ",I would upgrade the stereo system as I am partial to JBL that comes with my 07 Toyota Camry. I also would like a more sportier steering wheel that would be a little thicker.
