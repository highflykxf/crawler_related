3.5,Nothing But Tears,loveeanne ,07/05/2015,,,4,4,4,2,,3,1,5,5,"I've had this car for 5 years. Two of those years I spent at college without it. I've put about 60,000 miles on it. I LOVED this car. The first time the engine misfired, I thought ""no big deal, this car has been amazing to me"". It was all down hill from there. The engine has misfired twice and needed to be fixed. The breaks have been replaced four times. A valve broke off near the transmission and oil leaked down into the clutch. I needed a full clutch kit replacement and parts of the transmission replaced. That was less than four months ago. Last week, my timing belt broke without any warning and bent my entire motor. With that, I will have put over $4,000 into this car for repairs.","Great on gas, was always willing to go the extra distance when it was capable. Great memories. ",

I would advise to drop it off at the dealer for a full checkup just before warranty runs out. On my car the bracket that holds exhaust pipe rutted out and i did not notice after warranty ran out.I really like the look of the car. I owned 1986 excel, then first and second generation of Accent and now 3rd generation Accent. 3rd generation is almost perfect.","Looks great. Build quality is very good. However i did pay $21,000 for the top of the line trim.
Very good on gas. Turbo easy to park. When going 150km/h it does not feel like you a are flying a broom. Feels very confident.","I got a sport model. Definitely do not like stiff suspension. I wish dealer would explain me that Sport = Stiff.

Fuel economy can be improved. Use the direct injection and give CVT (transmission). Nissan uses that tranny for small cars.

If Hyundai puts a diesel in their small and mid cars, i will flip out and get a new one.

4,Just purchased ,kmunroe ,12/07/2012,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,Yes I first decided to test-drive my 2008 Hyundai Accent DS because of the pretty Apple Green color. First stick shift in 10 years; will take getting used to driving standard again. Granted this little car doesn't have power seats/windows/side mirrors. It doesn't have cruise control/tilt wheel. But it does have A/C and a CD player. My former car (2000 Taurus) had all the above except no CD player and the A/C didn't work for 8 years. It handles well and I like the stick-shift; you have more control. I suspect the car will also handle well in the snow because of the stick. ,"Color, CD player, A/C.

4,Excellent gas mileage,connie50 ,11/19/2012,,,4,4,4,5,,4,2,5,4,We purchased the Accent because of price and gas mileage and referral from a friend.He said mileage exceeds the posted mileage on sticker.The mileage on this car was 27-29 mpg highway.We CONSISTANTLY get 30+ running around in town and 35+ highway.So now that the news states Hhyndai over states their mileage on their stickers is TOTALLY wrong.We have had this car for 5 years and alway get min 30 mpg and usually 33-34 every time we fill up and we check our mileage every time.We get better mileage with gas from Holiday or Amoco.,"Gas mileage.
Like driving the stick. zippy little car.
Replaced all 4 tires w/new good ones and cost was $235 for all 4!!!
Cheap to drive.
No bells and whistles but that is fine - less to fix!

2.5,FAIL CAR and Dealerships,bamagurl251 ,01/13/2012,,,5,5,1,1,,1,5,1,1,"This is the email I just finished writing Hyundai about their 'Accent' and a dealership I am working with!My step-father Dale purchased an 2008, Nordic White, Hyundai Accent from Palmer's Airport Hyundai as a gift for me back in late August early September 2008.  I was in an accident in November 2008 where the seat belt snapped out of the safety position, the front end was shoved into the rear cradle suspension, all because the car failed to brake going 10 miles per hour and instead of hitting on coming traffic I swerved still hitting the brakes that did not work into an small median out in front of my place of business. My arm was shoved through the windshield as the air bag deployed late, and was sliced by the seat belt across my chest. I had the car repaired, and because it was new they would not total the car. After several thousand miles of travel to and from Florida on business, I began having transmission problems, the dealership replaced the transmission, and then the alternator went out and was replaced again. Following that 2008-2009 winter, the transmission went out again in the summer, I had the car taken into a differentdealership (EASTERN SHORE HYUNDAI) in which the car was not purchased the first time for the the first transmission.  Starting in 2008 problems began with the dealership (Palmer's Airport Hyundai). I am writing this because not only did I have an issue with your 'Road side assistance' that I have addressed in a previous E-mail, I have had several issues with the car and the dealership in which the car was purchased from.  In 2009 when my transmission and alternator was replaced by the dealership,I lost my job because the dealership would not grant me a rental vehicle. In 2009 I also had issues with the radiator that was not damaged in the above stated crash and the dealership was to replace it. Instead the dealership replaced the hoses on the radiator as it was leaking profusely on to the ground. Again in 2010 following another problem with the car 'the ignition and belt' I had another transmission failure and was replaced for a third time. This time it was taken to Palmer's for the second time for a transmission from this dealership. When I received the car, my gas had been ran out, there was a food receipt that did not belong to me or anyone that I knew, and the AC unit had been re-wired to that when you turned it on hot was cold and cold was hot. Thinking that perhaps the car had no anti-freeze I placed some in the car, low and behold, it was not the anti-freeze, it was the doings of the mechanics at the shop at Palmer's Airport Hyundai.  Following the crisscrossed AC unit and transmission issue being taken up with Palmer's Airport Hyundai, I began having brake troubles, even with new brakes where when I went over bumps my car would not stop I had to STAND in my drivers seat and put full weight on the breaks to make the car stop. I took the car into Palmer's and they reported back to me that nothing was wrong with the car. Again the gas in my car was on FULL when it was taken in and when returned to me the GAS was below 3/4 of a tank. Fine,I took the car to FIRESTONE and had brakes and tires replaced and still the car was not grasping the full effect of 'STOP'. At this point I noticed that I did not any longer need to push the release button on my Emergency break that it just all of the sudden comes up. I let it go seeing as how Palmer's kept informing me nothing was wrong with the car. Also in 2010 there was an cylinder miss fire and the car was not firing on all cylinders only three, anda gasket had busted off in the vehicle that took Palmer's nearly 4 weeks to repair, when they informed me it would take a week and they would be able to fix it within the week and release the car to me. Low and behold I waited nearly4 weeks for my car to be returned to me. Between that time my mother and I both called for check-ups on the car, and nobody could give us a straight answer. 2011 - My step Father signed the car over to me in November and the car was taken back into Palmer's due to a leak and the hoses where repaired and the car was returned to me fine no problems. Following this last visit to Palmer's Airport Hyundai where the CHECK ENGINE LIGHT was on and there was a fluid leak in the vehicle coming from SOMEWHERE that I nor 2 other family members could find out where, TODAY the car was returned to me again with an 'There is no problems with the car.' That was a total Lie. When I started the car in the parking lot of Palmer's Airport Hyundai it began to rattle like a tin can full of marbles. I know this is not normal for my car at all!!!! I started my car down the road heading towards home, and I kept hearing this high pitched noise and it sounded like my car had an JET ENGINE placed inside of the driving compartment. This is not and NEVER was normal for my vehicle. Instead of Palmer's FIXINGmy vehicle they have once again messed it up. The car was never ran which they stated they did, the gas tank was still on full just as I had left it. I wasexpecting like normal for the gas in my car to be GONE when I take it into Palmer's.   The car now sits in my driveway as we try to think of an alternative to the broken vehicle and I refuse to take it back into Palmer's Airport Hyundai. I am very unsatisfied with the vehicle and I am very unsatisfied by the work that this DEALERSHIP has done. I have never in all my life ever seen so much failure in supposed 'certified technician's ' While the service providers are friendly, they continue to mess up my car. I would seriously like some compensation for this or some sort of alternative from you the company of Hyundai. Im really fed up. Im irritated with the car, I am irritated with the company that SOLD the car too me, and I am irritated with the problems I am having and the 118.00$ they want to charge me for junk they will just mess up again.",,

I'm sure glad I have the warranty becuase tomorrow I have to bring the car in to be looked at. For the past few days the check engine light flashes on, and slows down while doing so. This only happens on my way to work (I have even let my car warm up to see if this works--it did not). Also, the transmition is slow. When i shift from reverse to drive, it has a pretty decently long delay. I find this almost dangerous if I need to back up and drive qucikly.","I love the interior of the car, it is very comfortable, perfect for a shorter person (I am 5ft 1in with short legs). I have been able to fit many things in the car, as I have recently moved and packed my car to the max..it held more than my 1999 Saturn Station Wagon did.

The interior is a little plain jane, but I actually wanted it like that. Roll up windows are the best. Power windows always one way or another will find a way to cost you money.

I test drove this car and the Yaris before ultimately purchasing the Accent.  The Yaris felt narrow while the Accent felt much wider, and has a warranty that can't be beat, for a couple thousand dollars less.  There have been mixed reviews about gas mileage but I am averaging 30mpg with the manual.  This car turns on a dime, and I have gotten TONS of compliments about how cute the car is.

The most pressing complaint I have is its long shift time, which makes the GLS 4-speed automatic feel kind of like a manual.  The suspension is loose too, which makes curves a little wobbly.  However, it returns good real world MPG figures, and is very economical in other categories.  Accent offers plenty of trunk room, passenger area and leg room, rear head rests, height adjustable seat belts, and many other features I probably still haven't discovered.  For what it is, Accent is an excellent car.","The exterior design is cute. It sort of looks like a ""goomba"" from Super Mario Brothers when viewed from the front.  I also like the design of the passenger compartment (the radio is tilted to the driver's point of view) and the smooth ride.","I suggest making the steering wheel a little stiffer, as well as the suspension.

4.875,my first new car.....for a long time!!,Beth Ann ,12/04/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I looked around for a car for almost 6months then I found my Accent! The price the payments and the insurance all fit perfect! I'm 20, live on my own and work full time and go to school! So money is tight but I never stop moving. I needed something cheaper, dependable, and good on gas. My little car is perfect! I can park anywhere and I love my XM. Oh and I had it out in the country for the first time the other day and it handle the gravel roads and bumps great.","My radio and the trunk, it has a enter handle so when your hands are full its still simple to get it shut. also i like the seats, they feel secure but they keep you comfortable.

2.25,Not what I expected,mechanic ,11/26/2008,,,4,5,1,1,,1,3,1,2,"The overall configuration of the two door hatchback is nice because it gives you large doors to get in and out of and large items can go in the back without the limitation of a small trunk opening.  My Hyundai only got 21 mpg to start and that declined to 15 mpg!!! For a 1.6 liter engine that is unreal.  The wipers did not work from day one and the dealer took over a month to get the part.  It ran cold always, the transmission way slow to react  and locked up at times.  The engine would tach over 4000 on the interstate in any kind of a grade and gave the feeling of going backwards.  The service department was impossible to deal with at my dealer making the warranty useless. ",The two door hatchback allows for large item to be put in the back the visibility is good too. The car handled very well but hit bumps hard. The standard features on my SE were a good value. (if the car was worth having) the lighted vanity mirrors are well thought out in how they operate.,Gas mileage is poor if you are in a state where you must buy a 10% ethanol blend.  The car is underpowered and the automatic transmission is not responsive with a tendency to lock up when downshifting.  Hyundai could make sure their dealer's service departments are competent and have parts needed

I have had no problems with the little car at all. At 75 mph it gets 31 mpg. At 60 mph it gets 41 mpg. At 80 mph its turning 4,000 RPM. It's a 5 speed manual, and I had a cruise control added. Service these guys correctly, and they should run several hundred thousand miles.","Fun to drive, fuel mileage.","In the 5-speed manual transmission, perhaps a 6th gear would be great."
4.75,Very Impressive!,Grumpy ,11/20/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"City driving has been between 26-29 mpg consistently with an automatic. Highway comes in at 33.

I was drained more than once with my old car. So far no problems.,"Cruise Control! Cruise control! Cruise Control! It's a much needed improvement. I could drive all day if I had one. Next time I'm ready to buy a new car I'll look at the Accent again. If there is no cruise, it's NO SALE! A rear hatch release is much better than using the keys all the time. "
4.75,Best car for the money,Mark S ,11/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I bought this car as a long distance commuter car. It's a GS model with the bottom options package so I could A/C. 5 speed manual. I work a week on and a week off so I drive once a week 135 miles there, and a 135 miles back. I have also driven this car all over Southern Louisiana and Eastern Texas for work as well, and once to Chicago. The comfort level of this car for long trips is good. The seats do hold on to you well in tight turns. The shifter, steering wheel, and pedals are all positioned well. I have gotten as low as 27.5 mpg and as high as 35.5 mpg. My average 31.5 mpg. I researched the Yaris and Aveo as well and this is hands down the best deal.","It is fun to drive. It's not the fastest but you make it happen with the manual. The passenger seat moves far enough forward so I can get my son in his car seat in the back while standing hunched over in the car! I'm 6'1"". 6 airbags and the leg room. Easy oil changes, I've done one of them.",Cruise control. I had to put in my own unit for $140.00 but I didn't mind so much. The inside panels do scratch easily.

4.625,Good Car,PAULO ,10/24/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,5,4,5,5,After a lot of research I found that the Accent was by far the best vehicle for the money.  I got the SE with all the options including sunroof/body kit/Auto for $14700 including tax and fees.  Just like the one you see in the marketing posters.

I test drove the Yaris, Corolla, and Mazda 3 first, but found this a far better value. I also considered the Fit and Versa. I was most interested in a quiet ride, mpgs, price, and warranty. The Accent hatchback is great for these reasons. I was surprised the others had so much road noise at a higher price. That said, over about 60mph the Accent engine gets more noticeable.  The only things I miss from my old Rav4 are cruise control and a rear windshield wiper in snowy conditions. Traction with snow tires has been great.","Looks, fuel efficiency, road noise (when under 60 mpg), 100K mile warranty, interior appearance.","Rear windshield wiper, flatter folding rear seat to more directly compete with the Honda Fit, a 6th gear, less dated looking clock/air bag status part of the dash console (it's reminiscent  of a Stanley Kubrick film set in the ""future"")."

5,Super Little Car at a low price,Glenn ,09/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had my new Accent for a few months now.  This is the 4th Hyundai I have owned and Hyundai never lets me down.  The best warranty out there.  The best price for a small car out there.  The 2-door Accent is sporty, peppy, has style and class you cannot find in anything in this price range.  I bought the vehicle with automatic and AC with XM satellite radio and CD for only $11,200 including TT&L.  No one could come close to that price.  Not Aveo, Fit, Yaris, or anything else.  ",The sporty feel and of course the gas economy.,Hyundai has got to do something about the front seat belts.  You have to reach way back to get the belt.  A real pain.

In addition to that the car is well put together.   It feels tight with everything working the way it should.   Hyundai has really closed the gap with the Japanese.   I am VERY happy with this purchase.","Economy, price and build quality.   I'm a pragmatic person and this is a very functional car with lots of space.  My favorite feature is the build quality. Nothing feels cheap.  Nice car for a very nice price and I'm averaging 36 MPG in mixed city/hwy driving.","Anti-lock brakes should be standard.  A 6-spd transmission with a nice tight shift linkage would be VERY nice.   The door scratches easily.

It isn't a fast car but feels very well built, is fun to drive and is extremely high-value.   I drove all the competition and liked the Accent for both the interior layout, quality feel, conservative design and price.   It was a good $4500 cheaper than the Honda Fit.   Gas mileage was 36 MPG on first tank with mostly highway driving.   In town driving on 2nd tank was down around 31 MPG.   That could improve with break-in, airing up the tires and synthetic oil.   Overall I'm pleased with the purchase.   Hyundai has made incredible strides in quality.   Fit/finish is as good or better than the Japanese cars.    ","Fuel Economy, Price, Warranty, functionality and interior volume for class of car.   I like the way it is built.   Hyundai has made enormous strides in Q/C.   It is solidly built and feels like a much more expensive car.  ",Anti-lock brakes should be standard on all vehicles.  Wish it didn't have the TPS monitoring (required by the govt.)

I have never been disappointed yet by a Hyundai product or service.  The only thing I can say is that if you buy a Hyundai in the Houston area do not go to best Hyundai as they are total crooks.

5,This is a great little car!,cwrivera ,06/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my second Hyundai. I bought it for the commute and haven't been disappointed. After looking at the the Yaris, Fit, and Rio I found the Accent to be the best value for the money. At 10,000 dollars and mileage at 37-38,(moving along at 70-75mph) the cost to own in my opinion is better that the 15,000 dollar Toyota or Honda. I have the GS manual with the ""popular"" package that has air conditioning and the upgraded radio.

4.875,My first new car.,Grumpy ,06/21/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After 38 years of driving I decided to buy my first new car. The style, size, performance and costs all come together with this car. I get 29/35 mpg. Accelerate lightly, let the car get up to 36 and let the overdrive kick in. Don't beat it to death.  More than enough cargo space for day trips. Checking under the hood is a breeze. All cabin controls are at your finger tips. I'm over six foot tall and have plenty of head, hip and leg room. Very quiet cabin, even with a big truck next to you.  Best warranty in the business!","How the car handles. Very nimble, holds the road well even behind s semi. Handles road defects well. Don't expect a Cadillac ride, but for this class of car the ride resembles a larger car.",The gas pedal is closer to the driver than the left foot well. You have to sit a bit side saddled or you have a tendency to hit the gas pedal harder than you intended creating a bit of a rabbit start. Adjusting for an even leg stretch between the left foot well and gas pedal is needed.
5,good starter car,SAM ,06/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We actually bought two Hyundai cars at once. I had one graduating from UCONN and another from community college that needs a commuting car for her junior year.  The price was right and the warranty better than the others. They each bought the version they liked and they are better than the used cars out there.  There is nothing on the used market with good gas mileage like the deal we got on new cars.  They both complained about the blind spot, but are happy with the mileage and having reliable transportation.

5,Great Starter Car!!,DOtarola ,06/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Honestly, I was set on buying either a Nissan Versa or Sentra but now I see that my Hyundai Accent was a great choice and is a great starter car for me because of the great gas mileage it gets and it is compact with all the necessary options. I especially love the radio because of the bigger screen and the XM. Most of all I feel safe driving it even though it is smaller than most cars. It has great control and sustains the bumps and potholes on the streets. Overall, I would recommend any student driver to purchase this car because it is affordable and has mostly everything you need.","XM Radio, gas mileage, color option","cruise control as a standard option, power seats or more comfortable seats, include DRL"

5,the homework paid off,mom of 5 ,06/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After lots of surfing for ratings, we decided to go with the Accent. The price and mileage were most important to us. We recently got our Tango Red little car. We are so impressed with all of it. I would have enjoyed a few more options, but choose to keep the price down. I would certainly recommend this fun one.",I can park anywhere! It feels like a sporty car.,the front seatbelts are a bit hard to grab behind the seat.
4.75,Think green.,Go Green ,05/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,3,5,5,5,"So today I bought my 2008 Hyundai Accent in the bright green. I think it's called candy apple.  Anyway, I have put all of 5 miles on it so I will be writing a follow up review but thus far I absolutely love it.  It has an aux jack which is a plus, 90 days free XM and great fuel economy.  I would opt for the SE if possible because of the extra features but they didn't have one so I settled and do not regret it.  It is a little slow to accelerate which any one of these reviews will tell you, but the fuel economy makes up for it.  As far as ride goes it's great.  It's my first Hyundai and I am super happy.  Just do your research because that's what smart car buying is.  I hope this was helpful.  ","Aux jack, XM, good sound for a little car.

4.875,WoW! Boy was I wrong!,Larry R ,04/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I have always driven either a large sedan or suv. I thought that a small car would be uncomfortable,slow and poor quality. Boy! Was I wrong! The Accent that we purchased is quick, made of great quality and is as smooth as any large sedan or suv that I have ever owned. Let me clarify quick. I took this Accent on a short road trip to California from Las Vegas. I was able to cruise at around ninety and I was passing much large and more expensive cars along the way and in L.A. The best is now I put in $25 of gas every eighth day instead of $50 every three days. I did look at other small cars such as the Toyota Yaris and the Chevy Aveo. I found the Accent to have a better value and warranty.",The great gas mileage. I will never purchase another large sedan or suv again.,Cruise control should be standard.
4.75,Great Car,kiwiegrrl ,04/14/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I bought the car about a month ago, and I've enjoyed every minute of driving it.  It handles much better then other small compact cars that I have driven.  The gas mileage was the biggest reason for purchasing this vehicle.  38mpgs highway, you can't beat that.  Its a very fun and peppy car to drive and the 'Mellow Yellow' color just adds to the fun.  The only thing i had to get used to was the blind spot. Very large blind spot.

5,GREAT  -- For the Money,Phil ,04/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I drive about 70 miles per day to work and back, and my 90 Montero had over 200K , so I went for it. I am totally happy with it, no complaints whatsoever. I am averaging 37-38 MPG on every tank. I am a consistent, conservative driver who has kept a record of every drop of gasoline since 1959 that I have bought. Nothing has ever compared to this car mileage wise, and it is surprisingly fun to drive as well. With a price of $10,000 including A/C, I recommend it to anyone who needs fuel economy combined with a high quality vehicle (10 yr/100K warranty thrown in) that is fun to drive. I normally keep them until they die, and hope to have this one at least 10 years. Go see your Hyundai dealer now","5 spd shifter is cool, drives like a much larger car, fuel economy can't be beat (who needs a hybrid costing twice as much or more?) Excellent warranty.",None.

After checking VW rabbit, Scion XD, Honda Civic and Lancer, I drove the Accent SE as I always liked the looks and still own a Santa Fe with 70000 miles. It has respectable power and the SE handles very well. The 5 speed B&M shifter is smoother than the Mazda's and is very comfortable and quiet on the road. Interior is spacious and fit and finish is very good. I'm averaging over 30 miles per gallon so far in combined city/highway driving.

4.25,Good for Tall Folk,John ,11/16/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,5,5,"While out shopping for price and value, I happened to get lucky with the '08 Accent GS.  While the one I bought has little more than a stripped base car, it's well-made, handles better than it should and is a comfortable, peppy little car.  Best of all, for a guy 6'4"" there's not only room for long legs but also I can even get in wearing a hat!  Right now recording about 25-27 MPG in mixed driving, far better than the EPA estimate.  But in Tampa, visit another dealer than Courtesy.  And watch out for ""full disclosure"" financing presentations that try to run up the price, especially for unnecessary, rapacious ""gap"" insurance.","Daytime running lights - just leave the headlamps on.

The Accent offers more standard features than the Yaris: arm rest, adjustable height drivers seat, tachometer, 6 air bags, split fold down rear seat.  The construction quality is superb.  And the warranty is unbeatable.  The car is peppy and very nimble in traffic.  It is especially good on curvy roads.  Shifting is smooth.  It hugs the road.  It also gets good gas mileage.  This car is equal to anything being produced by Toyota or Honda.  And it is very fun to drive.",I like the comfort of the seats.

I have found it with the 2008 Hyundai Accent GS in the new color for this year 'Mellow Yellow'.  This car is so fun to drive.  It takes alittle getting used to the engine rev, but it will run fair for a 1.6L 110 horsepower pony of a gas slipper.  Can't wait get some accessories.
