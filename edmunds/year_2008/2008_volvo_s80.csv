5,Fantastic Vehicle - Understated Excellence,JB ,12/14/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,4,,,"Ordered and picked up for European delivery. Fabulous experience, seamless and excellent handling by Volvo from A-Z. Now NINE YEARS LATER - my S80 AWD V8 - looks and drives like a new car..  Volvo service has been incredible and I've had very few issues. I get an occasional check engine light that is difficult to diagnose. Resetting solves the issue. The radio broke. Volvo replaced it out of warranty no charge parts and labor. What don't I like? The rear seat room is a little tight, though the front is awesome. Very supportive seats for long hauls. The car uses premium; but in a vehicle of this size the transverse mounted V-8 makes the car a rocket ship (when needed). The pearl white metallic tri coat paint is an industry best. Five stars on a nine year old car in showroom condition - still turning heads - Ask me in another nine years! Love it.",,
5,Used 2008 S80 Nicer than Most New 2016 Vehicles,qroberts ,02/25/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,5,,,"Just bought one of these used for around 12K and have been floored by the quality of the vehicle.I went out looking to buy a new (2016) vehicle but just was not impressed with any of the sub 30K offerings. I haven't bought a new vehicle in 18 years (drove a 1998 Mitsubishi Montero for that entire time) and I was expecting the offerings to have changed substantially in that time. Instead what I found was pretty looking vehicles with terrible visibility, cheap interiors, frustratingly anemic CVT's and lackluster fuel economy. If I'm going to drive an unresponsive brick I expect it to get close to 30 MPG overall, not 21 city 28 highway. My massive, old clunker of an SUV got 18 city 25 highway and was fast to boot.So I was pretty disillusioned and decided to go have a look at some used vehicles. Our family has had many Volvos and apart from replacing turbo seals (an issue they have apparently resolved since 2001) never had any issues with them at all (and I'm talking not a single one of them has ever failed to start or had a single mechanical failure over about 40 years of combined driving, 5 cars over 8 years each).So I started looking and was quickly interested in the AWD S80's particularly the turbo inline 6 or T6. I test drove a 2008 with 64000 miles and was elated. The car is solid as a tank, looks new, smells new, feels glued to the road and is a ROCKET! I bought the car as soon as we got back to the dealership.The vehicle is a little slow getting through the first 3 gears unless you give it a little more gas but once it's going and especially on the highway, the car is untouchable. By far the fastest most responsive vehicle I've ever driven or ridden in with the exception of a standard BMW M5. The ride is really smooth with almost no body roll even in tight turns and you feel glued to the pavement. The AWD is definitely noticeable versus front and rear wheel drive mostly as a reluctance of the car to deviate from the line it's on until you turn the steering wheel.Like I said in the title, every aspect of this 2008 S80 is nicer than any new 2016 car I test drove and that includes safety features. You'd be a fool to pass on this car if you have a chance to get a low mileage one.",,
5,The understated luxury car,Mike Schumer ,09/07/2015,5,4,5,,,,5,4,5,,,"The Volvo S80 is a great car if you don't care about status but still have luxury. It is one of the safest cars on the road. Yes it's ride is so comfortable and disconnects you from the road but that is nice sometimes, especially on long trips. I own a Mini Cooper so I get my road jollys with that. People complain about the inadequate performance of the base engine. I find that to be a ridiculous statement. It's not a sports car, it's a luxury sedan that handles any road situation under normal circumstances. This is my second Volvo, my first bought new in 2003 and still have it at 235,000 mile. Volvos are known for longevity. Yes maintenance and some problems will arise but it's not as expensive as a BMW or Mercedes and will probably outlast both of them. This is a practical luxury car. It's not for people that care about what others think or how fast you can go from 0-60. I got Volvo's 2008 flagship with 48,000 miles on it for $12,500. Not bad for a car that should be around at 235,000 miles.",,
4.75,I love her,itsvolvosafe ,12/19/2011,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I bought this vehicle because it was a much better value than comparable BMW and Mercedes models and it also does not come with the pretentious stigma commonly associated with owning one of this cars German competitors. My previous vehicle was a Mercedes ML 320, it had many problems and was worth less than $5,000 when I bought my S80 and I still got more comments from people about the vehicle that I drove. The S80 has a subtle presence while still offering most of the power and luxuries that come with owning a BMW or Mercedes. It is not as dynamic as a 5 series or a powerful as a E550 but it still has as much power, performance and comfort as you could want in an everyday driver.","Safety, V8 power, exhaust note, comfortable and simple interior, premium stereo, heated/cooled seats, AWD for NW Michigan winters, adjustable suspension, radar-guided cruise control

The attention to detail and quality of workmanship is outstanding. I have owned Lexus (GS and ES) and infinity (G35) and although good cars, the attention to detail is not as good as Volvo.  If the long term reliability is as good as consumer reports rates the 2008, then I can see myself buying Volvo's for a long time.    Performance is outstanding. The 280hp T6 is very fast, especially if you use the tip-tronic shifting.  Yes, there are faster cars, but I don't think anyone balance of elegance and performance that the Volvo S80 does, not to mention its claim to fame safety features. Don't miss this one","I have to say that the upgraded stereo in this vehicle is awesome! The Dynaudio brand is super high end. 650 watts, little to no distortion, 12 speakers, what can I say?

The T-6 is the features we were looking for in a ""sports"" car.  The body design is very nice and we see people looking at it all the time.  4WD's are hard to find but we wanted that for the extra security when driving (lots of rain where we live).

The car is made for cruising and is extremely comfortable and has a solid and powerful feel. The safety features are truly advanced and work well. In fact, due in part to the BLIS and Lane departure systems, I feel my driving has actually improved. The T6 is very quick and has tremendous power in all situations. Of course, we will have to see about the reliability of all these advanced features, but so far the car has made me fall in love with Volvo!","Heated/cooled extremely comfortable seats, dynaudio sound system, lane departure system, keyless entry and drive, adaptive cruise (really great for road trips!)","The only option this model appeared to miss is Bluetooth, although there are some good 3rd party systems now.

I do not know how a BMW can beat that but I can tell you that the advanced setting will glue the car to the road. The ventilated seats are something very dear to my heart. The inside beige color is very elegant. I have an option that lets you change the degree of stiffness of steering. So you get Lexus soft and BMW stiff if you want.

I have had mine  now for 19 months.  If you desire sport and comfort it's a excellent choice. However, not many autos can compare to the ride the Lexus 350S in comfort, but the Lexus lacks speed, handling and power. It also is a (front wheel drive)car. However, the combination of power, and torque will change your mind about the S-80 AWd/T6, it will run with a 7 series BMW. Do you hear me!!!!!!!!!!!! Two months ago I raced a 7 series and KEPT PACE, UP TO 120MPH  for 100 yds","The acceleration, no question, as I said this car is a sleeper, go and get BMW 5, or 7 series and let's put it to the test.

The car comes up short with the handling; it has a floaty feel to it and I live in Europe and have driven Audi's, Passats and Lancias.  These car have great pick-up; this car does not; you learn a lot about a vehicle when taking a trip from Germany to Italy through the mountains at night.  Overall I have to say it is a nice car but the suspension needs work; Turbo is necessary if you want to get that extra kick when you need it.  Also, some features should come standard with the car, e.g. blue tooth, front and rear warning detection for parking.   ","The interior; absolutely sublime and elegant (enough room for 6' 7""); it makes you think you are in a shop where your mother will say, ""Don't touch anything!!""  The normal sound system is very nice; Dynaudio must be phenominal.  The look on my ex- girlfriend face when she saw I had bought this car.  ","If Volvo wants to compete with BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Lexus they need to work on the suspension (soft and floaty) as well as the power (in europe we constantly get into races and I have lost several to smaller engine cars; (get more oomph in the 3.2 or ditch it for the Turbo)."

The wind noise at 50+ mph is unbelievably loud. I have been back to the dealer twice, 3 tires were replaced because they were defective. The tire noise & vibration is still there. the tires are Continental. My owners manual had tire info for 2 other brands. I guess Continentals are cheaper for Volvo. I am shocked by the poor ride from a supposedly good company. My VW Passat rode much nicer. I drive the same highways to work an hour each way, so noise is very upsetting.

Purchased the car this summer during the $4/gallon gas era and got a fantastic deal that the other brands could not touch.  Nice quiet ride with adequate power - not as well balanced as the BMW5 - drives a little front heavy in some cornering.  Bottom line is that I would still purchase this car should I move out of the snow belt given the price point.

I still could live without the Nav but really enjoy the keyless feature of the PCC and will definately buy that again - BLIS is cool, but staying aware of overtaking cars seems easy enough to me.","Sticker was $49k plus - can I have real wood inlays please!?

Although critized I find the ride quite smooth and as pleasant as my wife's Mercedes. The car feels like it floats, and such is not as engaging as BMW, infiniti or alike. The car rides like a cruiser. The car has great passing power, but feels a little slow off the line. The interior is all soft to touch and feels like reserved luxury. You can tell all controls were put in place with safety in mind. The Navi is placed on top of the dash and is operated via steering wheel controls to minimize driver distraction.
