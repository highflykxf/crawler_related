The 5-cyl engine must be warmed up or it sputters on the next start (why?).

Back seat storage is nil (see Frontier).
Speakers stink on my loaded model, leather seats are comfortable but already have broken bevel with normal usage at 65k.
Why does it require a 30 second (awkward wait) warmup? This non-inflated, good-looking and powerful truck has so much holding it back. I'll be getting rid of it soon. "

I've put 130,000 mile on it and the only issue I had was the water pump went at about 80,000, but it was covered under warranty. The only other annoying little issue is that the rear brake squeak after awhile. There is brake dust that builds up in there. This truck has a snow plow in the winter and I tow a trailer for the band and my classic 55 Chevy so I am not easy on it. Towing up hill is a little rough. Gas mileage is decent about 22 hwy and about 17-18 city","Small compact, good entry /exit, decent gas mileage, pretty comfortable. Very reliable Tows well, handles well, stops well. Nice stereo although I wish it had an 1/8 jack input for an MP3 player. 15"" tires are inexpensive to replace",I would put disc brakes on the rear instead of drum brakes. The drum brakes squeak.

First, the back of the seat does adjust and there is a lumbar firmness adjustment.  My wife is particular about back support and she really likes the comfort.  Second, the rear headrests do restrict view a little, but all you need to do is fold down the seat.  If someone is in back their head would block the view just as much as the headrest - use the rear view mirrors.  We have the Z71 with the 3.7.  The ride is not as smooth as a car but it passed the wife test, she really likes the ride.  Not a rattle or squeak anywhere either (bought it used with 13k).  Overall very pleased so far.","Good ride for a truck, right size to fit in parking spaces, plays MP3 in dash, plenty of room for kids in back, slot in bedliner - put a board there so stuff does not slide forward in the bed. ","These issues are MINOR:  Rear fender flares nicked from stuff coming up off front tires - should probably come with mudflaps std on Z71.

4.875,Great little truck,Tom ,05/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is my first small truck and I am very pleased with it.  Rides great, has a peppy engine that accelerates quickly.  My friends Nissan small truck is not as good as this one. Forget what the editors say, this is a mighty fine truck. Bed liner should be included in the future. I have 6000 miles on it and had no problems. Gas mileage is better than indicated by 2-3 mpg.","Peppy engine, XM radio, automatic headlamps",Power seats
3.125,Bad Apple,linusanderson ,04/29/2008,,,4,4,1,1,,3,4,4,4,"I bought my 2008 truck new Dec 27, 2007 (it only have 2400 miles on it now ) and it has spent more time in the shop than on the road. If it setup for a few days it will not start and the dealer feels that the problem is resovled but I do not. I am afraid to use this vehicle for out of town trips because I will never know if it will leave me stranded in another state. This is truly a let down since I have been a Chevy man for thirty five years. I feel that a 2008 vehicle should be more reliable than its predecessors. ",The black color,That this vehicle be made more reliable that its predecessors as for as ability to start when you want it. After sitting for a week it should start right up and not have to be towed every week to the shop for trouble shooting.
4.75,Lotsa bang for my buck so far!,Alex ,04/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"After a $5K rebate, took mine home for $23,655 before fees and taxes.  Mine came with the 2LT trim w/Z71 off road pkg.  So far, no mechanical problems, but wish it was available with a 5 or 6 spd. manual tranny.  Am not really sure either why the editor(s) panned it so much.  Friend of mine bought a Nissan Frontier and if we're comparing interior fit and finish alone, I'd say they are the same. ","XM radio, sunroof, 5yr/100K mile warranty, and overall looks.",Offer manual transmission on 3.7L engines.  Make the sunroof open wider.
5,Great Truck Good Performance,ShadowKyo ,04/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got the Chevy Colorado because I was tired of driving small cars. I am glad I did, I enjoy the fact that I am higher off the ground great visibility. Interior is top notch compared to some of the other trucks I looked at, very modern. Has the looks of a bigger Silverado without the pain at the pump. Also the automatic is smooth and after driving nothing but manuals for the last few years, it's nice to not be jerked around. Only complaints I have are the keyless entry doesn't work aall the time the first time and the engine fan is incredibly loud when it's engaged.","MP3 CD player, smooth transmission, great power for a small engine, great fuel economy","Better reliability of the keyless entry, Engine fan noise."

4.875,Great Truck,lucyb ,02/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded my 2006 Tacoma for the Colorado Crew cab, 5cyl, 2wd.  To be honest, this was my first American vehicle in quite a few years.  I was very surprised and pleased with the quality of the truck and the power of the engine.  It's a fun truck to drive and has all the creature comforts that I wanted.

4.625,This truck is misunderstood,rickypaul ,02/04/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"I don't get the bad ""expert"" reviews of this truck.  It is the only Crew Cab pickup available with a 4 cyl engine.  It performs adequately and gets 26 mgh o the highway!   She's comfortable, quiet, and her exterior styling is the best in its class.  I drove them all, the Tacoma rides rough, the Frontier is worse.  It has the best back seat in its class.   Don't be swayed by the so- called ""experts.""  Test drive this truck and make up your own mind.  By the way, all of the ""innovative""  features in the Tacoma and Frontier, such as the tie down tracks) will end up more of an annoyance than a convenience. The Colorado is a good solid, reliable pickup.",Tire pressure monitor. Oil life monitor. Fuel economy. Bench seat (only midsize that seats 6) Auto headlights. Multi-angle tailgate.

4.75,Great New Truck!,jerkyleg ,01/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I just bought this pickup, but I must say, I love it.  The only thing I am not happy with is the tires it came with.  They are the General Ameri- Track Tires.  I would prefer to have gotten A/T tires with a 4x4 ",Powerful 4cyl. engine!  Excellent handling!,Better factory tires
4.875,Nice truck!,Jason ,01/22/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a great truck for running around town. Very quiet cabin when driving around town and at highway speeds. Plenty of leg room and the leather interior is very easy to keep clean. I get around 20 mpg around town, and a little higher on the highway. I have had zero problems so far even though some reviews by rating editors question the quality of build. This is a very nice truck for the price!","Exterior looks, leather interior with the sunroof,heated front seat, XM radio!",Put radio controls on steering wheel.

Very roomy & good pep from engine. 3 trips approximately 400 miles ea and I get 25-26 mpg (automatic transmission). These trips have multiple small towns to pass through, hwy speed is mostly 60-65mph. I do not know where the Feds get their mpg information. I have always got the advertised or higher mpg on every vehicle I have owned. Zero quality problems with this truck but only 6&1/2 months ownership.",,Shorten the turning radius - 44 feet is ridiculous. Better wet weather traction on rear wheels.
