We moved far away from the original dealership and the car died in 2012 while still paying the loan off...no service shops near us could diagnose or fix the car..it had to go back to the dealer only.  I started reading online reviews abt the car..and that year...many people reported transmission problems..ours wouldn't go forward or in reverse..it could be a chip reset or transmission..but either way the tow truck, diagnostic fee and repair would be all on us...we couldn't afford all of that and we felt Smart should have RECALLED these cars.  We got no help from the dealer, or the 800 numbers. My friend's car was purchased the same year and needed the same thing..a new transmission...a 4k repair. My loan over 7yrs was approx. 35k and now the car needed a 4k fix...the car isn't even worth 4k for resale.  I am beyond disgusted and pissed.   I am looking to take a law suit against Smart.",,
4,Glad I did the smart thing,W. Blakely ,03/29/2016,5,5,4,,,5,4,4,4,,,"I bought a used 2013 Smart Fortwo with 27k miles on it from a Mercedes dealer.  Love this car.    I drive it 50 miles round trip daily to work averaging 38mpg.    At first I was skeptical about driving it at high speeds or in heavy traffic, but my experiences have been all good.     As with driving any car, I don't like having some idiot riding my tail when I'm going 70mph.On the inside the car doesn't really feel small.  It's narrower than most cars yes, but because the majority of the car is devoted to passenger space, there are no issues with leg room or head room, and I'm 6'1"" tall, 250lbs.    There is adequate space in the hatch for getting groceries or carrying a couple of suitcases.  I sometimes I forget I'm driving such a small car until I park, get out, and look back at it.  I've read other reviews complaining about the ride.    It's not a Lincoln Town Car, but I have no complaints.   I do try to avoid larger bumps and potholes to save wear and tear on the suspension and front end, but I do that with all of the cars I own. I've also read reviews complaining about the transmission.   No complaints from me though.  The transmission is an ""automatic manual"" transmission, with shifting controlled by a computer rather than my foot on a clutch pedal.   You can also shift manually if you want.   Either way, if you don't like the feeling of a manual transmission, you won't like the smart car.  Nuff said.The interior is not luxurious but it has all the amenities you would find on any mainstream car.Overall, driving the car reminds me a little of the old VW Beetle (1960's and 70's vintage) as both the VW and the smart are rear engine German cars.   The smart is about the same width or a little wider than the bug, but more comfortable.    The smart of course has all the electronic dash features as well as A/C and cruise.   The smart is also more fuel efficient than the VW was.   And the smart is much quieter; you can just hear the 1000cc Mitsubishi engine purring in the back.",,
3,Randamley doesnt go in Reverse,Emily ,09/03/2015,,3,3,,,1,1,2,3,,,"Personally believe that Smart car needs to fix the problems with the reverse issue. This nearly caused me to be in an accident at the end of my driveway. When I thought my car was in reverse is wasnt it actually was rolling down the drive way. I was stuck in the mioddle of the road trying to figure out why I couldnt get it into gear, had to shut it off while on coming traffic had to slam on the brakes! Very scarey and very close call. I feel that this is a saftey issue. Smart car has done nothing about it and does not want to recall it. My car is the 2008 Smart for two. I think that most people that have this car have the same problem. To help this get resolved people have to get on safecar.Gov and make the report for complaint, so then it will be forced into recall. I believe that people may have tried to make the report but the safecar.gov wasnt easliy working for that make or model until I called them directly. I just want people to be safe and companies to own up to their products. From my research its a computer update that is needed and yes its pretty expensive, well maybe just to me, to fix it is about $500.00",,

For various reasons, from plastic pieces falling off the interior to the air dam in the front snapping off and dragging on the freeway. The gas mileage is atrocious for a car this small (around 25 mpg). The transmission is a confused and nervous little curmudgeon that can't decide what gear it wants to be in when you're under 15 mph and keeps jumping back and forth between 1st, 2nd and 3rd gear. Every time the gear shifts the car lurches back and lunges forward like I've slammed on the brakes. And this is normal for smart cars, every one I've been in does it, even after having the transmission firmware upgraded.",The heated seats are nice.,"There's really no fixing this car, it's been scrapped and redesigned several times and they still haven't gotten it right. Driving this car is like driving one of those little plastic ride-ons they sold at Wal-mart when I was a kid. The build quality is seriously disappointing. The transmission is a joke.

A relaxed driving style works wonders. The ride actually improved with time.  Winter driving is okay, but winter parking after a snowstorm is painful because the smart is so light.  In the Summer, the AC occasionally blows hot air or the fan stops, and this is after the fan was replaced, a popular warranty fix, I've been told.  The driver side airbag cover popped a bit.  Unsightly.  But that's the extent of the bad stuff.  Overall, the smart is still mostly a pleasure.  I'm 5'9"" weigh in the high 200s and the car is comfortable and easy to enter and exit.  The ragtop of choice.",Price for a new convertible can't be beat. Parking space availability is glorious.  Riding solo means plenty of cargo space.  MPG is never under 30.  No more getting stuck behind garbage trucks!  Joy!  Perfect size for the city.

If thats the case mercedes should do a recall and fix them all.)  The suspension is rough with even minor bumps being uncomfortable.

Initial fuel economy was disappointing, but rapidly improved after putting ""Sea-Foam"" fuel system cleaner in the tank. Am now getting 38.5 mpg in city driving.  The local Smart dealership was very friendly and reprogrammed the transmission to largely eliminate the 1-2 shift lag in my 2008 as part of a no-charge update to 2009 standards. This made a huge improvement in driveability!  Highway stability in cross-winds is somewhat squirrely, but I had no trouble keeping it in the lane even when x-winds topped 35 mph on a fast causeway.

Do you need trunk space that will hold more than a suitcase or two?  If you answered, ""No,"" to one or more questions, then the smart deserves consideration.  Yes, the ride can be poor to fair, but the very comfortable seats make up for a lot.  Yes, the transmission doesn't shift that smoothly, but it can be described kindly as ""easy going.""

Although not a high performance machine, it's very peppy even at freeway speeds. I was surprised at the space behind the seats with the two-way opening rear door lets you put even tall things in upright.

Emissions - from 12 L/100 km to 4 L/100 km. Lost my Diesel 2 days ago. Dealership never explained the parking procedure for the 2006 model. Read the Operator's Manual carefully before purchasing the Smart Car. Anyways it rolled across the street even with the EBrake on. Now have the 2008 Limited Edition. Gas Model. Always stopping to fill up the tank - a bit of a pain. But I figure I saved about $250/mos. in fuel and emitting a smaller foot print. Off to dealership again 135 km away-glitch in Cargo Door window.

I had heard tales of astronomical fuel economy and how the EPA numbers were grossly overrated. After owning a smart for several months I can say that this isnÂ’t the case. It only gets about 2-3 MPG better than the civic it replaced. It is much slower, doesnÂ’t brake as well, doesnÂ’t handle as well, and has far less room. The build quality is also dubious with minor trim pieces breaking or feeling very flimsy. For such a small car with such a small engine and so few amenities I feel it should get much better MPG. If you are buying this looking for an ultra fuel saver spend a few dollars more and get a civic/focus/corolla. ","Style, size",For the compromises it must get much better fuel economy.

That's when I could sense Mercedes' technology was in this car.   For a micro car, it is superbly made.  The car started to drive even better when I reached the 2,000 mile mark.  My partner is 6 foot 4, and he rides comfortably in the passenger seat.  I am more satisfied than I thought I would be. ","I get the best parking spots.  Well made, safe.  I feel like a celebrity!

Big SUVs seem determined to zip by, but I just wave at them as I pass them at gas stations.  I've had no problems on the freeways at 70 mph and still getting 40-42 mpg.  All town driving is getting 33-35 mpg.  It is fun to drive and while it doesn't ride like a Mercedes Benz, I didn't pay for a Mercedes Benz.",Favorite feature is the room inside.  I am constantly amazed at how small it looks on the outside.

The good:  great interior for such a small car.  Great visibility. Mileage is better than epa if you drive it properly.  Features galore, like clear roof, paddle shifters, fold flat passenger seat, storage in tailgate, heated cloth seats, heated mirrors, climate control.  The bad:   suspension needs more travel and needs to be stiffer.  Too much roll.  Too many thuds when bumps are hit.  Automatic/manual trans is both the best and worst feature.  I would prefer a straight manual.  No spare tire. Premium radio is only so-so.  ","Nice interior, including a beautiful steering wheel, fabric on the dash, heated comfortable seats and more room than you expect.  It is a very nice environment in which to sit.  ","Fix the suspension, give us the choice of a clutch pedal or improve the shift action.  I guess I want the Brabus edition.  Run flat tires or a spare tire.  Release the service manual already.  "

I loved it, and it was much less powered and of less quality construction that my new 2008 model of 2 months and 2000 miles.  It's a great little car for convenience, handling, economy and appearance. Just watch out out for potholes and speed bumps, and remember that it is a small, basically low powered car, that will still drive at 80 MPH if you want to - and maybe have to on the Interstates, where huge tractor-trailers often enjoy driving 5-10 feet behind you at that speed.

It is fun to drive, comfortable for two large people, and provides a reason for all of those who see it on the road a reason to smile. We can fit groceries for a week for two in the back compartment, as long as it isn't a Costco trip with large bundles of paper and cleaning supplies.

I put myself and a buddy, (both 200# plus) and accelerated 0 to 60 in two blocks, not bad for a care that gets 40 mpg in town and 50 hwy.

I am getting 40 to 45 MPG going back and forth to work which is part city and part highway driving. On the highway I am getting 45 to 50 MPG. So the actual mileage if you drive it moderately in automatic mode is much better than the EPA estimates. The car does not feel as small as it is. Very comfortable in all types of weather. Heater and A/C work great. In fact it heats up and cools down much better than regular size cars because there isn't much space to heat and cool! Will easily run 90 MPH on the highway and very smooth and stable at that speed. Handles very good around corners also. Very agile in city traffic. Like driving a go-kart!,"I like the removable plastic body panels. Tridion safety cell and all the safety features which are standard like the ABS brakes, the Stability Control, frontal and side airbags, traction control,electronic force distribution,tire pressure monitors,acceleration skid control (like positraction).","I think it would be nice to have a sport model available like the Brabus in Europe.

Sure, it could use better gas mileage, a smoother transmission and longer warranty , but what car is absolutely perfect at this price level?

Drive a car with manual transmission before driving the smart, and then you will appreciate the auto-shifting transmission. The performance is excellent considering the great fuel economy. I drive mostly at 60 to 70 mph and average over 40 mpg. Mileage improves and the transmission shifts smoother after the car is broken in.

But the $120 I spent for one wasn't too bad. I don't miss the armrest because the Saabs I learned to drive on never had one. And after 2000 miles I've learned to drive  it without the transmission lurching. Once you get used to it, it's an impressively fun car for around town and driving by yourself. It's got its faults, but I never drive it without a smile on my face. The naysayers just don't get it. Too bad.

I live in a town where my immediate neighbors drive Bentleys, Mercedes, Porsches and Ford GTs (and one old Ferrari).  BMW's and Audis are banned because they stink of the middle class, (but I did see a democrat once driving a Saab before they ran her out of town).  And yet I must get more waves, thumbs-up and smiles from the Cougars (35-40- something divorcees) than when I drove my v12 Benz convertible.  Too funny.

I have parked the Tahoe & use this for work: 30-50 mi round trip/day.  Very comfortable for a little car.  It gets you from pt A to pt B economically & relatively comfortably.","Room: tons of it.

My husband convinced me to drive a Smart and I loved it.  Now we negotiate about who will drive it the next day based on time and miles to travel.

Reliability = 1 star for obvious reasons - anybody who sells a car with the worst waranty in America (2 years) doesn't trust their own product.  Performance is fine if you don't mind accelerating from 0-60 in 14 - 15 seconds.  Certainly something I'd deal with for 100 mpg (not even near what this car gets)  Gas Mileage - we're talking about pushing around a golf cart with a 1 liter engine, and 30-40 mpg on premium gas is all it gets?  If this were a 10 grand car, and averaged 80 mpg I'd have 2.  ","The interior is great, for as small as it is, it seems solid.  Aftermarket capabilities are limitless, I can't wait till I see these sold for $500 with blown engines/transmissions.

It's roomy inside, the controls are logically placed, and it has every thing you need for your commute. At speeds over 68 mph, the drag from wind causes the car to bumble about a little. However, it performs strongly at 70, but must be urged to maintain 80 mph. Tailwinds from large trucks toss it a little too. But this vehicle was not designed for freeway travel, anyway. The transmission is a bit jumpy at slow speeds as well. It bucks a bit when it shifts.","I love the size and cute design. Everyone stares and smiles! Some people even laugh at it.

I challenge you to try to find a convertible so elegantly designed or better engineered than this. And for $16,590. You can open the top from a distance with your key (nice to cool off the vehicle before you get to it). The side rails come off and store in a special compartment in the rear designed just for them.

I've been anticipating buying my fortwo since 2006. I'm glad I followed through with the purchase because now I own a highly exclusive car with features normally only found in luxury cars. Those heated leather seats are great for days where you need a little warm comfort but don't want to kick on the heater.

It literally takes a certain learning curve to get used to it and get smoother.  Nevertheless, the car is super fun to drive.

Also note that the tire pressure is 29 PSI in the front tires and that the rear tires are 36 PSI. They were all set at 36 PSI and the handling on the highway was poor tracking and that loose front end. Gas mpg has been 37-40 on and off state highways, interstate. Also city driving, stop and go.
