5,Still Turns Heads,Thomas Watkins ,11/15/2016,5,,5,,,,,5,4,,,"Love my Sky Redline!!!  Still a looker; great fuel economy, cheap to maintain.  Fast, fun, extremely reliable.  Turns heads everywhere I go, & people still ask ""what kind of car is that?""",,
2,Nice car...bad example,Sean ,08/08/2016,,1,5,,,1,5,5,4,,,"So...most reviews on these cars are great. I would know since I've wanted one the day they came out. That was in middle school. I saved and saved and finally bought a very nice condition Sky Redline. Looks immaculate. Being a college student I took the safe road and purchased a sports car with realiability to back it (according to numerous reviews). WRONG! At least in my case. This car has been in the shop longer than its been in my driveway (unless we count the time it isn't running). The Chevy dealer I bought it from cannot locate the issue. It stalls, the fan stops working occasionally, my blinkers don't work when they want to...it's an electrical problem.  DO NOT do what I did and automatically figure it's a sound car...test drive it multiple times, have it inspected and be skeptical. Obviously my car is the one in a million with severe problems  (and none of which documented in multiple different VIN history reports) but just be aware so you don't end up like I did. I kmow these cars are great cars...mine just happens to be junk! I don't want this to happen to anyone else. When I read reviews I never once saw a post like this...it gave me a strong sense of security. I just want possible buyers to realize its possible for these cars to be junk. I'm not sure what the previous owner (there was only one) did to this vehicle but it must have been pretty bad. Unfortunately they knew how to upkeep appearance and make a wolf in sheep's clothing and I got the short end of the stick.",,
4.25,Midlife Crisis,Anonymous ,12/07/2010,,,3,5,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"This is my second Sky, I owned a base model which was no. 850 off the Saturn line.  I love the car and the only bad points are lack of storage space and ease of entry and exit, that's it.  Good points, styling, handling, ride, yes ride it rides better than my 2004 Acura TL, ask my brother.  Reliability, well don't have enough miles to judge that just yet but my first Sky only had a small differential leak recall (mine was not leaking but repaired under warranty) that's it.  My current Redline only has had the door latches replaced under warranty.  Saturn actually came out with a new design.  No squeaks or rattles and quiet for a convertible.  Pack lite, stay flexible, highly recommended.",Just the way it looks.  Everywhere I go it turns heads and people stare.  My friends have high priced sports cars and they do not get the attention the Sky gets.,More storage space.

One problem I have a rattle in the dash area that no one can seem to correct and it's driving me crazy. Need more luggage room so I'm looking at a removal luggage rack suggested by one of the reviews. My little red sports car now at almost 300 horsepower is a fun car to drive.,The looks of the car.  I get lots of looks and surprise when I tell them that it's a Saturn.,Pouches on the side of the doors.  More power Would love to see what 350 or even 400 horses would do for the car.  More luggage room of course.

4.75,The Sky is The Limit,Mike7642 ,11/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Saturn has built one fine little roadster. It doesnt just look awesome, but handles like a true sports car. The Sky handles turns with amazing performance and powers out of them with ease. Its big wide tires stick to pavement like glue. Once in the cockpit, you cant help but smile. One drawback, there is no luggage space for a really good road trip.",Killer styling that turns heads.,"More luggage space, but this could ruin the near perfect 50/50 weight ratio that makes performance so awesome."

4.875,"18 months, still a blast",lahilljr ,08/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I have been very pleased with my '08 Red Line Carbon Flash SE Automatic.  260 hp & ft/lbs torque in a car less than 2900 pounds that is sexy in black on black leather and lots of chrome equals a smile on my face and everyone that looks at it.  I have no commute so the miles stay very low (only 6800 in 18 months)and I use it primarily to bop around our small Florida community.  Decent gas mileage too, probably 20 mpg or so overall.  For what I use it for it's perfect, just don't get one if you expect to fit more than one other person and a small overnight bag!","Acceleration, performance, looks (esp. with top down), chrome wheels & accents against black paint.  Stereo is pretty sweet also.","Paddle shifters or manumatic please!!  Living in flat, gridlike Florida makes a stick undesirable to me, but I constantly wish for the ability to more easily downshift for myself.  Tire pressure light stays on no matter what I do.

5,Great Performance and Fun in a Looker,JP ,02/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a great car to drive. It's fun and delivers on performance, both in acceleration as well as grip and suspension on the twisties. And it looks like a million bucks. After a year and half on the road, I still get shouts of ""nice car"" or thumbs up from pedestrians and drivers alike.  Like any roadster, it does have its blemishes here and there. So if you demand high end fit and finish, take a long look before you buy. But if your main focus is performance, fun, and looks, this is a perfect 10. I dare say you will not find a better roadster on the market today in this price range.",Wide powerband. Exterior styling,Better placement of window controls.  
5,Wonderful Sky RL,agm226 ,01/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,What a great car! Fun to drive and look at. People always ask what kind of car it is! Bought special Sky luggage that fits perfect in trunk. Not a lot of room inside but geez it's a convertible! Want more room? Buy a bigger car! Bought saddle bag to hold the little extras. Absolutely love everything about the car!

5,Owner review of 2008 Sky Redline,Longmont-sky ,11/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is very fun to drive! Has great acceleration and reminds of ""space mountain"" at Disney world. Handling and cornering are incredible. Who says you need to slow down when going around a 90 degree corner! Pretty good gas mileage as well. I can get 33mpg on the highway and in the city I would say 24-25mpg if you're not too much of a lead foot. ","The acceleration in 2nd and 3rd gear when the turbo kicks in. The way it handles in corners. The very sexy look of this car, it's a real head turner.",Needs a little larger glove box and a nice leather dashboard. However the leather dashboard finish is available aftermarket and I'll be upgrading that at some point.  
5,What a Blast!,Ross ,11/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is just so much fun to drive!  If you're looking for a 2 seater that will bring a smile to your face every time you get in it (or just look at it), this is the car you're looking for!","Beautiful exterior styling, ""on rails"" handling, enough power, very good fuel economy - 27 mpg hwy on 87 octane - and a certain head turner!",Easier roof handling and a few interior design improvements.
5,It's good to see GM is reviving,Peter ,10/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car looks and drives like a mini Vette. If you are looking for a mean toy machine, this is it. Its chassis is stiff and the visibility is not the best but after all it is a pure sports car and all the rest is excellent; looks, power, fun, speed. Mind you I paid $55k for this car in Europe but it was worth it. If I were in the US I would buy two so you should at least buy one.",Design and engine are remarkable.,Although the inside quality is very good I would prefer a more German dash board feel.

I saw a black Sky in a parking lot & was one of those people who chased it down to see what it was! 4 months later I drove my Red/Redline off the lot! I love it!  Very fun to drive! The body style is awesome. It turned my head! The performance is great even in the mountains!  ","Great body style, nice lines, good paint finish, quality wheels. It looks so cute it forces me to polish it before every drive just so it looks its best when I get those looks! ","Interior is not driver friendly!

5,Awesome!,Diablo Winds ,08/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I love this car as my daily driver. Traded my Corvette for it so I'm down on power but still crusing in style. I'm getting around 26MPG so far. I'm only on my third tank and expect this this to improve when my spirited driving calms down.,"The top! If it's too cumbersome or hard, then you must have a rough life. This top when up adds to the style, unlike most convertibles. ",Move the window controls to a better location. Keep them on the door but place them closer to the dash.
4.5,Next to my Vette it's a fun ride,Dale ,07/13/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,I tried both the base engine and the turbo and the difference was very pronounced. My 64 Vette 327-365 HP 4 speed is a fun ride but my 73 year old left leg is getting weak. The automatic in the Sky is plenty fast and the old leg is quite comfortable. Top up or down this little baby is as fun to drive as my other baby a 1949 MG TC which is a 4 speed. To complete my passion for neat cars I have a 2002 Trans Am convertible with an automatic just as a backup. The Sky is a perfect runabout vehicle and the future is here. Side mirrors are questionable and the lack of a decent console storage box is apparent but I'll just get used to it. Great car Saturn and it really draws looks from the Solstice ,The turbo and handling are the main features mechanically. Top is first rate and body fit and style is right in line with my other cars as far as design and performance.,Seat belt is a pain. Hard to find in the retracted position at the door and difficult to snap together as the release button end is too short or close to the trans hump. Side mirrors not good poor visibility over fenders..
4.75,Drives as good as it looks,exstreamliners ,07/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I owned my Carbon Flash SE for about 2 weeks now. It drives remarkable well. Fast when you want fast. Sound system is spectacular. Everyone stops me wherever I go. I even took it to another Saturn dealership and everyone at the dealership stopped what they were doing to come and take a look. The only downfall to the car is there is no trunk space, I take s suite case now and then. The other downfall is if you have long legs you can't adjust the seats much. I do wish the steering column was extendable and not just a verticle adjustment.  Otherwise, it is fantastic!","Sound system, powerful engine, great looks.",Create a slightly longer car to allow for seat adjustments and a little bit of trunck space.
4.875,Lovin this car!,Lee's Gem ,07/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I am continually surprised at how much attention this car gets! At gas stations, the grocery store, garages, old and young, people come up to me and talk about this car. Everyone loves the look. I knew I loved it when I bought it, I really did not think it would generate this much buzz with people I didn't know. I drive it for mileage on my commute, put the cruise on at 72 and get 30-33 mpg on the highway. Then the weekends, I drive for fun, punch it whenever I can get away with it. I'm putting the cold air intake in soon, I've spoken with other owners who are getting +3 to +4 mpg with it plus the 10 horsepower punch. Best purchase I've ever made!","0-60 in 5.5 with the automatic. Handles as well at 90 as at 30, hugs the road like it's on rails. Turbo pickup at any speed - feels intuitive to what you want to do. Leather interior is well done with the door inserts. Steering wheel controls, XM radio, hands free phone are all great.","The cupholders used to bother me, but they really are in the only place they possibly could be. It is a roadster after all. A 6th gear for cruising would be fantastic. Just move the power window and mirror controls further up the door to fingertip range instead of elbow range."
4.75,True enjoyment!,Darksky ,06/01/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I fell in love with the looks the minute I saw my first one! It's one of the best looking cars on the road and for the money a lot of car and a great buy. I don't understand the reviewers complaints about the manual top. It's simple, fast and reliable to operate. It's so small I can't see the need for motors and a drive system. The performance, handling and braking are exceptional. The car is a constant hit with everyone you meet. I love the XM radio and all the small speakers. Even with the top down at 80 sounds are still clear and strong. It's fun to drive and the enjoyment factor is way high. A bonus is the ease of manuevering and parking such a small car. ",The gas mileage. I have a Redline 5 speed and I get 28mpg regularly. I really like the handling and drive 78 miles per day to and from work in very heavy traffic. My favorite point is the great enjoyment and fun I get from driving this sporty little car. It's very easty to bond with this gem!,The instrumentation needs some more thought. With the top down on a sunny day it's nearly impossible to read anything. The deep-set instruments are also hard to clean. I have to agree with the comments about the cheapo cup holders and the window/mirror controls being poorly located. 
4.875,Awesome,steven ,05/25/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This car left the idea of the trunk to the wind but who cares?  No spare tire. Car is comfortable for small car. It was built for fun not a family and it is fun and fast.  Love it! ,The turbo engine screams,Make the top eaiser to handle

The car mags groan about the top, but with only a few uses it became a 3 minute process. I have trouble finding cars that are comfy for my back but there was no question - this is great! Compared to the 35 mpg in my SC2 the 25mpg isn't good mileage. This car is a definite head turner and most people can't believe it's a Saturn. People at work want rides w/ the top down and there may be a waiting list somewhere. The lack of storage is a problem, but I've invested in the removable luggage rack, which Saturn doesn't tout as an answer to that problem. Was recently at a car museum's roadster exhibit and people were looking at my Sky!","The hands-free phone is great, and the sound system is awesome at only 6 speakers. The car handles great and I'm not sure about why the reviewers mention ho-hum steering.

I had always wanted a Vette for a 3rd fun to drive car, but she did not like the new ones and finding an older one that fit our budget just did not work out. It was not until I saw one in person that I fell in love with the car.

The next day she was at a dealership in Fort Lauderdale and by the time I got home she owned this car. I can't stop driving it because its just so much fun. Forget about the negative reviews, you must drive for yourself. The trunk space is not bad. We used a soft luggage and was able to pack enought stuff for two days. The 3 hour trip to Keywest was just awesome, fun, exciting, and we had to flip a coin on who was going to be the driver. The OnStar (turn-by- turn), XM radio, and telephone (great reception) is just great. Saturn you did great on this one. A+ baby.   ",The turbo is a must. The interior design is great.

We knew then we wanted one, it was to be a fun car only and not a daily driver.  We waited a year for the prices to come down and mark up to go away.  The car is quite quick for being non turbo, I recomend the manual trans, I drove the auto in the test drive, it was no where near as fun.  This car is not purchased to be practical, I have a Toyota for that.  I dont know why all the automotive journalists don't get the point.  The manual top adds to the fun.  So what about trunk space, if we need it, we dont drive the Sky.  ","The styling hands down, I get thumbs up everywere I go and watch people check out the car.  The handling and braking is perfect.

It gathers a crowd no matter where we go. Like any small 2 seat roadster it has limited trunk space but there is more there than one thinks. And contrary to some reports - putting the manual convertible top down is actually fairly easy and with little to no practice can be a quick one-hand operation. The built-in OnStar and hands-free cell phone are wonderful. The 5-speed manual gets great gas mileage. The only downside is that you may suffer some pain at first from the permanent grin that you will have from driving and owning this car.","This car has lots of power, quick throttle response, super smooth cornering, and good braking.
