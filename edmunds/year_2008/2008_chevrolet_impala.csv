The new set is not OEM and came with a three year warranty.  I have had to replace the accelerator senor (twice) and the door actuators (once).

The car looks great in the red with the large wheels but that's really the only upside.  We've owned over 30 vehicles over the years and this has to be the worst.  Problems started right away.  Door locks stopped working, the CD player stopped working, the ABS/ traction control has had problems 2 different times.  Of course now that everything is fixed it has a pretty substantial coolant leak.  Maybe we got a lemon, but this car is truly a disappointment.  I think we're done with GM.  Our 06 fusion has been perfect through 80k miles and this car has serious problems with only 40K miles on it.",Looks,Don't know where to start.  GM needs to really work on their quality.

The care runs extremely well and is smooth.  I would buy again, but there are a few troubling issues. The car uses a quart of oil every 1800 miles.  The dealership is looking into this to see if they can find the issue.  Cylinder deactivation works very well.  Car handles ok and rides well.

This car is strictly a cruiser with very soft handling and very smooth ride. This car is not for performance enthusiasts wishing for feeling the road as they drive.  I'm particularly fond of the exterior styling in a mocha brown color and the tail lights are a nicer improvement over the previous design.  There have been no mechanical issues with drivetrain, brakes, electric, or any engine issues.  Aside from a few minor flaws,  I would purchase this car again in a heartbeat.  The Impala has proven to be an excellent value for the money, and fuel economy for a V6 is fantastic.","Suspension, smooth comfortable ride, 24 mpg city, 33 mpg hwy.

The only thing that i dislike about the car is that the heater doesn't throw heat continuously when the car is in park. Bad situation if you ever get stranded on the side of the road in the middle of winter.

It corners and stops pretty good, though it has quite a bit of understeer when you push it to the limit - overall not bad for a full size car.  Also needs to side support in the seats like the Grand Prix GXP has - these seats are too bench like.

3.5,Chevrolet has cheapened the Impala,Charl ,04/08/2010,,,5,5,3,5,,5,2,1,2,I was very disappointed in the newer Impala as I owned a 2005 and loved the vehicle (my fault for not researching).  Chevrolet has left out many of the old standards of comfort and the gas mileage is very disappointing.  We have owned at least six Chevrolet cars and I'm sorry to say I will think twice about purchasing another.,I like the style of the car and the uncluttered dash.,I used to get 30 mpg and now get 22 mpg.  Chevrolet should be ashamed for not improving the mileage!!!  Make the seats softer - my husband's truck is more comfortable.  I miss the back seat that folded down for trunk access.

Passing is a blast.  While some reviews call the suspension tuning ""boat"" like, I'd strongly disagree.  I believe it handles very flat and also takes road bumps well.  Very good mix.  I have yet to cause the front end to push taking corners way to fast.  The seats do limit your cornering as they have no side bolsters.  Since most seat time is cruising, this is an acceptable trade off.

4.625,great car,john mccall ,04/08/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,We turned in a Cadillac DTS and got the Impala.  It has as large a trunk as the caddy and the rear seats fold as well.  The seats could be improved and the a/c controls are silly but the ride and comfort approach the best. Looked at all the rivals and this was the beat for the money. Have had GM products for thirty years and the reliability has been tremendous. For the money this is the best buy.,Styling is eyecatching yet functional.  The leather seats are well done and the car is easy to get in and out of.,Put the Cadillac a/c control in.  Improve the OnStar voice recognition and replace the shifter with a leather one to match the reat of the interior. Gas mileage is not as good as a Cadillac even though the car is 600 pounds lighter and has a smaller engine.

Salesman said I would be happy with LT, and saved a lot of money. He was right. The traction control is a must in the snow here in Canada.  Never had a problem. 2nd winter with it and reg. all season tires! By the way we found that if you order a car with the features you want it can save you money on the sticker price.

XM and OnStar are great.  303hp doesn't hurt either. Have scared a lot of tuners on the line when the 5.3L makes the tires scream (just remember to turn off the traction control).

This car is the most underated car out there! For all the torque steer issues all you have to do is turn off the traction control and the car tracks straight! The traction control applies the brakes on acceleration and pulls the car all over the place. Fuel mileage has been an avg of just shy of 20mpg and I just got under 25 on a recent highway run to Va. Sure you can knock a couple of things on the cheapness of certain things but turn the key and listen to the American muscle! It compensates for everything else!

However, having driven this car for a few months now, I find it excels in only one area -- gas mileage. I get about 28 mpg average, which is great for a large 6 cyl car. Everything else about the Impala seems crude & under- developed. It's already been in the shop twice for a faulty steering part & brake rotor resurfacing (at 15,000 miles). Acceleration is rough & uneven, handling is awful, and seats are poorly designed. This is not the car that will save GM from bankruptcy.

The black granite metallic paint and 18-inch wheels give the exterior an attractive, masculine look. The front interior is very nice. I like the brushed metallic dash a bit better than the faux wood offered on the base model. Rear seat leg room is cramped if the front seats are all the way back.

My transportation has been predominately in the city, which gives me about 24-24 mpg. I have taken the car on one trip across the state of Wisconsin from Milwaukee to LaCrosse. The ride was good, and the vehicle got up to 32 mpg on the trip. It may have gotten better, but we had it fully loaded with 3 people and about 450 lbs worth of 'stuff'. That is what I find neat about this car, it's full size and the ability to get mileage that competes with the small compact foreign cars. The other thing I like is the oil life indicator, I get about 5,000 miles between oil changes.","Fuel economy indicator, OnStar, huge trunk, and Ipod music hook up. Found that tires need to have 31psi cold pressure for best ride and gas mileage for vehicle performance.",Radio and heater buttons take a while to get use to. While don't underestimate the styling.

5,Big Car on a Mid-Size Budget,Michael & Kathy ,04/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We commute short distances but like to take multi-state road trips. The Impala fits in the garage and budget but flies down the highway without any strain. XM radio and OnStar's navigation are great over the road tools. Finding an E-85 station is particularly cool using OnStar. The hidden storage under the back seat is nice for the lap top rather than in the trunk.  All the trip computer readouts are nice when the scenery gets boring.  We also considered the new Malibu but tiny things like the 2-zone A/C and power passenger seat ruled the day. A couple of small items would have been nice, memory settings for the seat/mirrors and a wider choice of wheels. Thank goodness for TireRack!","Remote start, heated seats, XM, flip and fold rear seat, tire pressure monitors. E-mailed by OnStar! Great mpg  great ride, quiet.

2.25,This Is A Real Bow-Wow,Fed Up ,04/18/2008,,,3,3,2,2,,2,3,2,1,"For the upper end of Impalas, this has been a real joke.  The rattles and windshield leaks make you feel like you're watching an outdoor concert of bad music.  Hit a pothole and OnStar wants to know if everyone in the car is OK--even though they think I'm about 80 miles from where I actually was . . . and they called back three times to verify that nothing was wrong.  I listened to them more than the radio.  Where do I find the fuse to kill that beast?",Not much,"I'd rather have it without leaks, rattles, and most importantly, OnStar!!!"

It was tough to get use to at first but the power that the SS has along with the comfort of the ride is taking care of all that. I plan on doing some things to make my family sedan a real speedster. Overall, it's comfortable to drive, it's got lots of power and speed when you need it. The torque steer is something to get used to. You can also gain a little speed by taking the traction control off. I am happy with it and growing happier. I almost bought the G8 but I like the build of the Impalas. Go get it, you won't be disappointed.","XM radio, sunroof and torque/power, ride/comfort. Feels well built, runs strong.","Need to make these vehicles rear wheel drive.

The Impala is actually not a total bore to drive. The shifts are crisp and at the right rpm. Actually encourages you to show some muscle to 80%+ cars on the road that this vehicle will blow away. When it comes to hauling children or family this is the car.  Something you cannot do in a Corvette. The only thing that worries me a little bit is the active fuel management which shuts down to a 4cyl when all 8 aren't needed.

The car has close to 10,000 miles on it and the experience thus far has been pleasant. The biggest surprise to me was the fuel economy numbers. I was averaging around 25mpg with my 2006 Nissan Altima 2.5S. The Impala averages that at similar driving speeds. However, recently, I decided to slow down to 65mph and my fuel economy jumped up to 28mpg!  The interior is very comfortable and the seats are supportive. The CD player hiccuped and had to be replaced - now it works great! The ride is smooth and quiet. The engine can be a bit buzzy when the RPM crosses 2500.

I recommend this car to any one who remembers the great cars of the sixties. I am getting between 23 and 25 mpg. I am happy with my 25th new Chevy.

The quality of the Chevy Impala is far superior. And with the 3.5L V6 we've attained 26 MPG in the city and 33 on the highway, far better than the window sticker said. I'm glad I didn't fall for the Japanese foriegn car hype. If you don't believe it, go test drive an Impala and compare.

Be aware that even the upgraded ""LT"" does not include ABS brakes.  I didn't even think about this until I got it home.  It simply did not occur to me that in 2008 a large family sedan would ship without basic safety features.  GM should be ashamed of themselves for this kind of reckless penny pinching.  Additional penny- pinching becomes more evident as you drive the car more.  Features that most people consider standard in every car, such as a folding back seat, are optional in the Impala.

And the service adviser said they often have problems with ""burned"" cd's vs bought cd's.  The ""burned"" cd's can cause them to hang up and not eject.

I got the leather package and seats are comfortable but could use more side support. Great room up front, but lacking a bit in rear leg room for as big as the car is. My only beef is the paint finish - the hood has 2 big ""blotches"" - dealer noted it and offered to repaint under warranty, but something as bad as that should have never made it out of the factory.","Good balance of economy and power, very comfortable car overall.",Better quality control. Give the paint inspector an eye exam. 
4.875,2008 Impala Interior Comfort LS FlexFuel,GRDamoth ,06/24/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've owned over 30 vehicles, mostly GM some Ford, but compared to Cadillac this Impala is every bit as comfortable, quiet, quick, and nimble to boot.  Cushy rides are important on long trips, especially if the highway isn't smooth and comfortable.  This car handles predictably, and has good view all around.  I had a 1984 Cadillac for 13 years and this cars ride and finish is every bit as good.   The new radio is very intuitive and has excellent reception.  XM AM and FM don't have to be preset separately, you can mix and match up to 36 (yes three dozen) radio combinations.  Especially useful if you have favorites or favorite areas of the nation, and if you drive a lot.","The simplified cruise control and the sound system tie for making driving this car especially fun. Similar to my '84 Caddy cruise, there is an on/off and the cancel feature separate from these allows you to quickly cancel and then resume cruise.  The radio is 6-CD-MP3, XM, AM, FM superior. ","Slide the back seat back 2"" taking that space from the trunk and rear deck shelf would add a lot more leg room for rear passengers, although my 6'0"" frame fits in the rear even with the front seats all the way back. This car looks great, but I can't tell it from a 2007 on the outside, inside yes."
4.625,Smooth Ride,Arthur ,05/04/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"When loaded with leather, heated seats, retractable sun roof and a fine sound system this vehicle is nearly as good as the Hyundai Acera. The car cruises on the highway extremely well. It does not have the pep I would like but it does the job especially when fueled with E-85. This flex fuel vehicle gets a big lift from the higher octaine gasoline that helps solve the sluggish pickup problem. I found the vehicle not as comfy as my Cadillac Deville but it was nearly as nice. The price of this vehicle is right. The 28k I saved made me feel  a heck of alot better in giving up my Cadillac for the 31 mpg I now get on the freeway. Good value, good on gas and nice looking to boot.","GM is finally getting it when it comes to the small things. My vehicle comes with a stereo plug for my i-Pod and three power plugs for all the gadgets we now bring along for the ride. I also like the storage spaces where cables, coffee, spare change and such can be accessed with easy.",This car needs a bit more pep for getting onto the freeway. The lumbar support feature should be easier to use and more substantial. The leg room on the driver side needs to be improved. The drink holder is scary on this car. This car needs a telescoping steering wheel.
