In the first seven weeks we had to replace three tires due to bubbles on their side (irreparable damage, not under warranty).

My last few vehicles had 300 hp (Infiniti and BMW) but putting it to the pavement was not as much fun as with the Lexus 2.5L V6 6M.  All I can say is that with the 6 speed manual transmission, the car is actually a well balanced fun car to drive.  I drove a few automatics and didn't get the same feeling in the car.  Also, I have upgraded lowering springs, cold air intake, catback exhaust, short throw shifter, 19 inch IS-F rims, and added a spoiler.  The added power and greatly improved exhaust sound makes the car truly more fun than the BMW 335i or Infiniti G35",Smooth revving engine matched perfectly to the 6 speed manual gearbox.

Overall this is a great car. I agree that there are more powerful cars out there, but I wanted better gas mileage and less power.  If more power is needed then the IS 350 is available.  On the vehicle there is a POWER switch that changes the shift differential with a notable power increase.  If you are looking, you may want to try this and save your self $4K.

I had an 05 Accord. I like so many things about the car. From its looks to the interior , the handling and comfort. I have 2 kids (2 year old and 7 year old) and they fit fine with enough room. They even say its a cool car. The only downside is the acceleration and that doesn't matter much to me because I'm not racing but it still carries more then enough to be around the city.

I think it's a great car for the money spent. People mistake this car as a sports vehicle; it's not. Consider it more of a luxury commuter. The car has lackluster performance but it is sacrificed for fuel economy. I have no regrets.  ,"Keyless entry, well designed interior, white interior lights, comfortable cabin.","12volt should be in a position to have the shoulder rest not opened, improved torque and horsepower, better MP3 disc cd interface.

I considered the Acura TSX and the Infiniti G35 but I went for the Lexus because I liked the design and wanted the 4WD. My only complaint is about the brakes: lots of dust on the rims of the front wheels and noise when you depress the brake pedal. This latter problem is rather annoying: every time I came to a stop and then release the brake pedal to move again the front brakes make a noise. I took the car to the dealer and they lubricated all the wheels but the problem still persists.

To start off with some negative points, it lacks on acceleration and power, rear legroom can be a problem, and the steering is a little too light.

The same level of quality, comfort, and technology you would expect from Lexus with the added ""pop"" of a sportier car.  I evaluated this car and a BMW 3-series and this won out easily - quality, ride, and efficiency.  The BMW has better engine sound but you can add F-accessories to the IS if you really need the sound.  Handling is better on the IS.

I researched and drove BMW, Audi and Mercedes before settling on Lexus. I was upgrading from a SAAB convertible. To compare the cars, you need to spec up each car equally, which I did. The Lexus is the best value by many thousands of dollars. The car is a powerful, smooth quiet ride if that is what you are  looking for. My average speed around Sydney is 38 kph so top end performance is nice to brag about but not a decision maker. Add an extra year's warranty and a world rating of most reliable car and you have some very good reasons for buying an IS250.  It exceeds the brief!","Practically, the touch screen for all the essential controls (air con, sound, GPS, telephone, rear camera) is so easy to use. The BMW, Audi and Mercedes have far less user friendly, non touch, user interfaces.  The IS250 is a little pocket rocket of technology, I love adaptive cruise control!","Rear legroom is limited but no more or less than its direct competitors.  The ""key"" that you must have on you but don't use because of keyless entry and keyless start is a pain. It sits in my pocket as a lump or I throw it on the passenger seat!"

The nav got some bad reviews, but I think its great. If you get the nav, take advantage and learn the voice commands! Interior is top quality. Love the leather (a/c seats), and how the dash isn't curved out. It's flat so front has good leg room. Saw some complaints about rear seat room. If you plan on ppl sitting in the back a lot, then you probably need a mini-van! Back seats are actually comfortable, but small with leg room. The exterior is the best! Lines are smooth where they should be and hard to give distinct Lexus style. Front is mean $ stylish!",Vented seats! No more sticking to the leather. Nav w/ bluetooth. Overall handling.

My only complaint is the navigation system, I don't feel it is Lexus's place to decide when I or my passenger can use the system, it greys out and can't be used while in motion no other automakers that I'm aware of do this. IMO don't buy the navigation sysem until Lexus changes their policy.     ","Cooled seats,back up camera,great fuel economy, integrated XM, paddle shifters.",Navigation is not acceptable.

For an entry level luxury car and a terrific base price, you can't get a better deal. The ride is tight with the Sport package but this is what I wanted in a sport compact. The power was surprisingly peppy, fun, and the growl at times was a nice tease that indicated there's still that hint of energy and adrenaline waiting to be let out. When needed, the car goes and in the cabin, the comfort conveniences are second to none. Excellent options and an excellent experience. Very satisfied!",Sport Package Wheels and suspension. Stereo is very strong. Push button start and keyless entry. Interior and exterior appearance is much better than competitors. Love the ambient cabin lighting / puddle lights. Options are fantastic.,A little noisy with the low profile tires and can be a bumpy ride at times but this is what is expected I guess.

This package is what makes a Lexus a ""Lexus"".  On the other hand the navigation system is not acceptable.  A passenger cannot program the system while the car is in motion, does not announce street names, is very complicated to program.  Do not waste your money on this inferior system.  Instead purchase a $300.00 portable navigation system.

Don't get me wrong, this is a very good car, and it was the AWD at a reasonable cost that sold me. The interior is beautifully well crafted, but not as ergonomically friendly as the Acura. You feel more road irregularities, but if were expecting not to you bought the wrong car. My biggist gripe (and I hate to keep comparing the TL) is the Manual/Sport shift. Nowhere near as seamless as the Acura. Even worse is when you move your shifter over into that mode, the default gear is 4th - rather than the gear you were in.

Went with the Lexus due to interior quality and richness and value compared to the bimmer. Coming from an Acura TL, the learning curve on using the nav system is huge. Toyota (Lexus) can learn quite a bit from how Honda (Acura) has implemented their nav interface. Drives like a charm, although I wish the steering would tighten up a bit at highway speeds. It would be nice to deactivate VSC and TCS while driving instead of bringing the car to a stop first. There is definitely room for improvement on the car.

5,Great Choice,Brent ,04/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had this car for 1 month and it's been a blast to drive. I really like the interior and exterior styling and it has a very smooth ride to it. I looked at the G-35 and BMW 325 but  you get more for the dollar on the lexus IS 250. Never really paid attention to Lexus before, but this is a great quality car. 31.7 MPG highway and 26 mixed. A 15 min test drive is not enough as I had to go back to drive it again. It took me several days to get used to driving this car.","cooled/heated seats, good factory sound system, sharp turning radius for u-turns, excellent handling, responsive acceleration and great fuel economy. ",Needs to be a  bit more responsive on acceleration starts but once you are moving acceleration is impressive. Brakes are a bit grabby. Blind spots are a problem plus it could use rear fold down seats.
4.875,Great car for the money,carfreak ,03/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I just purchased by IS 250 two days ago and I love it.  I traded an 07 Acura TL, but I drove the Mercedes C300, Audi A4 and VW Fahrenheit GLI.  Glad I chose the IS 250 even though the horsepower is lacking and doesn't compare to the TL I had.  I got an excellent deal on this car and the base model is loaded with everything I needed.  I did get one with HID, 18"" tires and upgraded rims and a few other items.  Drive it and you'll want one for sure!","Push button start, HID with auto level, exterior styling.","More horsepower, larger back seat, blue tooth without having to purchase navigation."
4.75,Awesome Car!,jules8174 ,03/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,This has been a great car so far.  It looks great and feels great.  It doesn't make a sound when it's on. The interior is also of extreme quality which makes everyday driving an experience to look forward to!  I highly recommend this car.,,
4.75,Great Car,Nick ,03/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,Had this car going on a month.  Great car.  Test drove the G35 and c300.  Picked the IS 250 because of Lexus reliability and looks.,"Great exterior, keyless entry/start button",Preferred a better navigation system.  Would love to have the G35 stereo and nav system.  IS250 does not have complete IPOD integration.  Nor can you burn CDs to harddrive like the G35.
5,Great car except for the Nav System,Karim ,03/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased this car a week ago, what a fun car to drive! It handled extremely well in the snow, AWD is great. I love the leather seats, smart key, radio. Paddle shifters are fun. Handles unbelievably!!  However, the experience that has been awsome in everyway was dissipated when i found out that several nav system available while the car is parked become inaccessible when the car is in motion. In the name of safety according to lexus.  If I were to agree that lexus can be my mother, I resent paying $2600 for a system that is literally crippled in my mind when the vehicle is motion.  Save yourselves the money get the car without nav and by a $100 3rd party nav system instead.",,I urge toyota to revisit this obvious bad decision if they want to keep the market edge.  
4.125,IS 250 Buyer's Remorse,Kat ,03/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,3,4,3,3,"The handling on this car is great.  It is very reliable and stable at high speeds. The interior is a bit small but feels and looks luxurious.   The horsepower is too low - it is missing that extra kick at acceleration.  The standard audio system is bad quality; my Bose system in my 96 Maxima was 100% better.  The bass is very weak and listening to music became a nuisance in this car.  The car makes a weird sound from the rear passenger wheel which I told was normal.  Overall, the car operates a bit noisy.  The IS 250 is a nice car but I feel I could have gotten a better deal for the money spent.  ","I like the bluetooth - however some friends complain of weird noises when I talk to them using this option. The navagation is nice, I would have preferred that the voice commands came out of all speakers not just the driver's side and it would be nice if the music automatically turned low.",MORE power! Better audio - this one is unacceptable for this quality of a car (even if it comes standard).  
4.875,Fun Car to Drive,SBK ,03/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I purchased this car last month, what a fun car to drive! It handled extremely well in th snow, AWD is great.

5,Great Little Car,RV ,02/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,From an SUV to an IS and I don't miss a thing.  The IS is a funny car that packs a good punch and its not a bad looker either.,,Would like a little more room in the back but otherwise a great car.
4.875,Lexus IS 250 AWD Handling Dream,Criticfilm on LEXUS ,02/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"This is an early review, I just purchased my new 2008 Lexus IS 250 AWD, Starfire Pearl. BMW 325i owner, so standards were high, researched and drove 2008 BMW 328i, Audi A4, Infiniti G35, all excellent cars, tough decision.  IS 250 needs more power, but overall great handling, love styling, features great, excellent service and prestigious!","The handling features, AWD, tight cornering in bad weather a dream. Xenon with AFS, start/stop button, unique design compared to other sports sedans, love color Starfire Pearl. Fully loaded, love dial switch moonroofs, hate holding my finger on older buttons.","More power! Frankly the car is wonderful, but I wish I had some more straight on horsepower. Rear room could be larger, then again I think of the car as a 2-door coupe with 4 doors so not a factor - single driver. Larger compartment for storage, iPod adapter too pricey, better steering wheel control"
4.125,IS 250 AWD,classact ,02/17/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,4,4,1,"I just bought this car. Styling, leather seats, radio, all creature comforts are great. Do not buy this car if you do not like the ride and feel of low profile tires. The ride is bumpy on the highway, and I can feel every uneven road surface and pothole . I'm very disappointed with my purchase. A 10 - 15 minute test drive was not enough time to get the true feel of this car. ","Leather seats, sunroof, nice radio, smart key, push button start.",More room in the back seat.
5,Wow,TA ,01/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I'm not suffering a second of buyer's remorse.  The car is a kick to drive, it is loaded with features, and everything about is pleasing to the senses (I find myself just touching various surfaces and marveling at how perfect they all seem).  It's tempting to think of the IS as a ""budget Lexus"".  That may have been true of the 300, but this is genuinely a luxurious car--all Lexus.  I'm getting about 32mpg on the highway and mid-20s around town.  Much better than the new EPA ratings.","Hard to say.  The car has so many great little features.  Overall, I'd have to say the smooth and quiet ride, coupled with a genuine small-sports- car feel in maneuvering.  The car just has everything going for it.",Maybe just one small easy-to-reach storage cubby for the driver.  Just for my phone and my gate card.
4.875,Completely Satisfied,Jess ,01/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I test drove this car expecting to not be impressed and I was completely wrong.  It looks great, feels great, is very luxurious, and has a lot more pick- up speed than the 250 suggests.  I couldn't believe what the base model came with.  The comperable BMW didn't even have leather and you had to pay a significant amount more for basic features.","Smooth ride, quick speed, extremely comfortable, beautiful exterior, easy navigation system, amazing first impression, very well equipped base model.",larger back seat
4.875,2008 IS 250 AWD (6A),Steve ,01/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Excellent car.  Really hugs the road, quick acceleration (not as peppy as the 350, but enough for a 36 year old).  I was in the market for a ""Certified Pre-Owned"" 2006 or 2007, and ended up getting a new one for a few thousand more.  Tells me they keep their resale value moreso than others I compared it to.","Navigation, Bluetooth, looks, feel, and ergo friendly controls.  ","Better gas mileage.  A ""Seek"" button on the steering wheel for changing radio stations.  You can only toggle through existing pre-sets.  Navigation systems locks you out of some features when the car is moving.  They're trying to keep from distracting your attention while driving."
5,Fun to drive,VinDee ,01/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I looked at the Mercedes c300 first but opted for the IS 250 instead. I have owned the IS 250 for 2 months now and the car is fun to drive. The 250 does get good gas mileage also. Rear seat legroom is minimal. One drawback is the paint. Already chipping on the front. I've owned other cars for years before the painted started to chip.,"Push button start, keyless entry, navigation, dual a/c, handling.","More legroom for rear seats, better paint"
4.875,"Sexy, Sporty, Smooth Ride",Jessica Gwinn ,01/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Perfect daily driver. Quick, quiet, nimble ride. All-leather cabin is sumptuous and extremely comfortable.  Much nicer than BMW in this price class.",Just a hot-looking car overall and fun to drive. Keyless entry eliminates shuffling through one's bag for their keys. Push-start is also a nice feature. Respectable factory sound system makes my iPod purr.,Front brake dust gathers too fast. The turning signal stays on even after sharp turns. The cup holder is too close to gear shift.
4.875,Great Overall Car and Value,TS ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Wonderful car all around. I added the HID headlights, XM radio, vent seats, and wood trim. The base models come pretty well loaded. While not a pure sports car, it has found a perfect balance between luxury and sportiness. The ride is as quiet and smooth as can be. When you test drive it, be sure to take in on some bumpy roads. You will feel the difference. I am 6'1"" and still fit comfortably into the front seats. No one can fit into the back seat behind me though. The trunk, while not very big, was able to fit my ice hockey goalie equipment. I also test drove the Mercedes 300, BMW 325XI, loaded '08 Honda Accord V-6 Coupe among others. In my opinion, the best value for your money. ","Tight, responsive handling. High quality and simple interior details. Love the AWD (live in the northeast). The smooth and almost silent drive. Passenger and driver power seats that move back and give you great leg room in the front. Get the navi and rear view cam if you can afford it, worth it. ","Headroom needs to be increased another 1 or 2 inches, but even at 6'1"" I still have room. Check out another car if you are any taller. The infiniti G35X offers some more headroom (2"" to be exact). I would love fold down seats too, but not many cars in this class offer such a feature. "
4.75,Awesome vehicle!,EJ ,12/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Before this purchase, I was also researching the Acura TSX. The Lexus got me hooked. Great ride, good power, and awesome styling. There is nothing on the road that looks like it! A lot of standard features including high ticket safety items that are optional on other makes. ","6-CD changer, push button start/stop, LED interior & exterior lighting.",Driver seat needs better thigh & leg support. I have the setting all the way high and I am still umcomfortable sometimes on long drives. Would love more engine torque off the line to compliment the 6-speed manual.

4.875,"Great overall car, highly suggested",Ennertia.com ,11/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"For the price of a base, it's a great overall value for a luxury vehicle.  I purchased only the leather package with automatic.  Handles well, lovely interior (doesn't feel like plastic) which is important for me.   I take clients out in this vehicle with good overall feedback.  Base sound system is decent, includes as base a 6CD changer.  Previous car was a Acura 3.2TL with a premium package; only difference I've found is that the Lexus handles better, smaller and maneuvers like a small car. ",Base model is well equiped.

4.75,Sweet deal,phast ,11/21/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I can't say I've ever owned a BMW or Audi (though I have driven them), so take note. I can say, however, that I love the IS 250 AWD. Looks great on the inside and the outside and drives well too. It may not be the 500HP BMW M5, but it has zip and the handling is phenomenal. The fuel economy is a bit on the low side, at about 22MPG for my driving. In extended highway driving (even avg. 90MPH) I've gotten the avg. up to 27.5mpg, so I think that the 26MPG # is a bit low.  No complaints so far... except that it's too damn much fun to drive.","Handling, AWD traction, quietness, keyless drive.",'tis a bit tight in the back and needs a light in the trunk.

5,Slick... but Still a Lexus,fleetfoot ,10/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Had an Audi that was about to bite the dust - thing was an absolute money pit. Fortunately, our other ""family"" car was a Lexus RX and we've had nothing but a stellar Lexus ownership experience, so when I decided to buy another AWD car, the IS 250 AWD had to be on the list. The car has not disappointed. Handles beautifully, looks good, plush inside and best of all it's a Lexus, so you know build quality and ownership experience will be top notch. Get the nav package (w/Bluetooth and rearview camera) - worth every penny.

5,Best Car In Its Class,Emily ,10/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I test drove every car in this price range and the Lexus made my decision so easy!  It comes with many features in the base model that other cars you pay extra for (like 6 CD changer, iPod adaptor, sunroof, leather, premium sound, smart key).  I got the base model because I felt like it was already very loaded.  It handles so smooth and tight.  My previous car was a 330i BMW and there is no comparison.  My BMW had the premium package and still was not as loaded as the base model Lexus.  ","I like how you can buy XM or Sirius and you don't have to buy a whole package to get it.  Many other car companies only offer satellite in a whole package.  I also like the way the base model is very well equipped.  I love the smart key, the way the stereo sounds & automatic headlights!  ","I wish you could just get navigation without a whole $5,700 package.  Also, 204 horsepower might not be enough for some people, but I like the added gas mileage and reduced speeding tickets."

I went into the dealership just to check out pricing and test drive it, then spent the next couple hours figuring out how I can afford the payments.  It was that easy.
