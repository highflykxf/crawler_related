Too big and bloated and cluttered with expensive, distracting technology. The 1 series is the spiritual successor to the older 3. Slightly smaller back seat and trunk, but closer in size and with a clean, driving-focused dashboard. We picked one up used with low miles and original warranty still remaining-- a good thing because we have had to use it a lot!We test drove a 128 but felt it was underpowered. The 135 was obviously more expensive but we fell in love the first time we pressed the pedal to the carpet. This car is stupid fast. In a dark color and especially with the top down it looks great.",With the 3.0T engine this car is stupid fast and has handling to match. Interior design is classic simple and driver-focused. Looks great with the top down. Heated sport seats are great. iPod integration works well.,The only significant knock against this car is its reliability.

Guess that's why the rust protection is what 4 years!

With its 6-speed transmission, it generally gets around 24-26 mpg in the city. I have always liked the looks of BMW. Now I get the look at a fairly decent price. The 128 is a luxury car without many frills. The interior has been pared of luxury to make space for roominess. Well for the people in front, anyway. It's still pretty much a 2-seater.  Oddly, for a BMW, the interior is without many standards items I have grown used to over the years. Example: The 128 is curiously without a functional cupholder. The only working cupholder is directly behind the shifter. I still love it. ","I live and drive this car in Germany, where I get passed on the Autobahn by SMART-car-sized cars doing 85.

Absolutely NO turbo lag anywhere on the power curve which is nothing short of a miracle. I have found nothing to dislike about this car whatsoever after 1700 miles. Of course the mileage is mediocre at best (16.5 city, 22-25 highway) but I knew that going in.  Fit and finish are superb and the cockpit is both comfy & functional as a true Germanic driving machine should be. Instruments are well placed and easy to use. No iDrive = no complaints.

Engine is fantastic, and the suspension is good, if not a touch soft. Fuel economy is decent, and pretty much what I expected. The seats are pretty comfortable and supportive on long trips, though not the best I've been in.  What I didn't expect is the car surrounding this great motor to be such a piece of junk. It rattles over every pebble, the passenger side window no longer works, and the ""premium"" speakers are defective and emit nothing but static when playing high notes.  Overall, not worth $40,000.

My wife drives a Saab 9.5 which has a better throttle response, especially at low RPM. Dealer tells me performance is 'within spec'. I can't see the radio with polarized glasses on. Radio seems to shut down intermittently, usually right after power-up. Dealer diagnosed a faulty fuel pump, and I'm on a waiting list for a replacement. Apparently they're on backorder???

A few initial complaints would be the passenger seat is a little uncomfortable when the cupholder is installed (although it is removable), the standard stereo is mediocre (speakers rattle at times and changing stations is not intuitive), the second cupholder can only be used when the armrest is in the up position (unless you use it for a really short cup), and the iDrive needs improvement.  If these complaints seem trivial, it's because they are.  Overall the car is a great little car that most people would enjoy.",Performance and overall driving experience.

It is that much fun to drive. I average 22 miles per gallon but you can get 27 if you want to drive that way. I don't. On the highway 28 is easy. I wanted a sports car but with a little more room. This car is by itself when you factor in room and handling. It wasn't cheap but the best never is.,"no body roll, the exhaust note,the engine,the solid feel,the raw power,the brakes,and of course it goes without saying the steering.",For me I don't want the auto transmission when in manual mode to auto downshift if it's not going to auto upshift.

There is a slight lag in the throttle response during highway (Autobahn) overtaking, but I can live with that.  Probably from the turbos.  Using the sequential manual transmission is a blast.  However, the gas mileage is really poor in that mode.  I drove a total of 29 miles all in the SMT mode and used a quarter of a tank.

Run flat tires ride like bricks. The suspension is a little soft. I wish the cruise control was on the steering wheel. Getting into 2nd gear is slow and temperamental.

The shifting is incredibly easy, the clutch is quite predictable and the power is relentless. I can be going 80 mph on the highway and floor it and the car just takes off.

Car is an A+ and really does rival a 911 for performance but exceeds it for comfort and practicality with real back seat and room for two or three sets of golf clubs in trunk. I've owned a 911, Boxster S and a TT Coupe.  The 135i blows them all away. ",Bluetooth for phone.  Performance. Brilliant and effortless acceleration. Steptronic transmission with two automatic and one paddle shift option. Interior comfort and look.  Reasonable cost. Real back seat and good trunk space. Push button ignition.,"Exterior appearance is a bit ""chubby,"" but I like it. Everything else is perfect!"
5,A hoot to drive!,Mike ,04/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The 135 is the perfect size for me.  The power is awesome. Was concerned about the iDrive but learning curve is quick. Inside storage is pitiful. No place for even your glasses case. One usable cup holder.  Red LED ambient lighting, without turning the dash intensity up to practically full, is not  visible. Should have been blue. Premium sound system/HD radio is supurb. Blue tooth and conviencence access great.  6 speed shifts like butter.  Cool feature is the brakes hold on a hill for a couple seconds so you don't roll backwards.  Paint, fit and finish top notch. One gripe...  Offer 18 inch, performance, NON RUN-FLAT tires w/spare.  Run-flats are problematic, expensive and wear out quickly.","Engine, Blue-tooth, premium radio, handling, engine sound and front seat comfort.  This is my first experience with the adaptive headlights.  They work so well I will probably always order these on future cars if available.  They are unbelievable.","One suggested inprovement is the nav system screen.  Menus (radio, system views, etc) are hardly visible in the daytime due grey background and black letters. Should be designed like the Alpine Systems. Black letters white background for day, revers (inverse video) for night (including the nav map)"
5,Best BMW ever driven besides the 650i,CrisFlip ,04/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I never thought I would fall in love with the entry level baby bimmer!! This car is quite capable of being considered an entry level M car. It's got more than plenty of power, agility, speed, and superior performance handling. If you want a nicely priced bang for you dollar this is it. It's a definitely in the ""gotta have"" car list. Although back seat is a bit cramped, but what do you expect on a ""premium compact"" coupe? Gas is not too bad at 26 highway. Great everyday car and always fun to drive. You have to test drive it and really drive it both normal and hard to appreciate it.","Turbo charged engine, paddle shifters, navigation, handling, sexy muscular look, and well balanced. Sound system is great for not upgrading to the premium sound price. Minimal options is best!!",Include alarm as a standard feature. Leave this car the way it is... perfect!! 
5,A classic BMW,Year1DC ,04/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Took delivery of my jet black 135i coupe the day they went on sale in the US.  Truly a great car, both in terms of performance and styling.  I chose the automatic with the paddle shifters since I use the car for urban commuting.  It's hands-down the best automatic I've driven - just put it in Sport mode and the car moves like a rocket.  It costs the same as a 328 coupe while delivering performance that is several notches above.  While there's no other car that exactly compares, of all the other cars I drove the Cayman S feels the most similar - and at $20k more, it makes my $44k loaded 135 seem like an even greater bargain.","An exhaust note that should make every 3 Series driver jealous.  High-quality materials and standard features (xenons with corona ring DRLs, for example) that are on par with other bimmers.  Blistering twin-turbo performance that makes an M3 or Cayman S hard to justify.",The run-flat tires can be very jarring when they encounter potholes or other rough pavement.  Gas mileage is great on the highway (I've gotten 30mpg) but in the city relatively poor mileage combines with a small (14 gallon) fuel tank to necessitate frequent stops at the gas station.
4.875,Just got my 135i,Ruffstik ,03/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Well I think I just picked up one of the 1st 135is in North America, at least it's the only one in Wisconsin!  This car just fits like a glove and when you first push the pedal you are completely blown away with the power of those 300 horses.  Was looking at the Infiniti G37s and was waiting for this one to come out. Gotta say that I'm glad I waited!",Engine!!,Can't think of anything yet.
4.875,BMW's finest vehicle!,TexasDriver ,03/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Not only the best looking BMW, all the legendary handling and driving dynamics are there.  The interior has adequate room for four although the rear seating can be somewhat lacking for large adults.  Wonderful safety features such as door anchors and BMW assist give you a break on insurance rates.  This car feels absolutely rock solid!  No creaking sounds, no rattles, as if its made of a single piece of metal.  It's cute on the outside and plush on the inside.  Get the premium package... worth it with beautiful leather/electric seats, cool compass mirror, and bluetooth.  This car may outsell the 3-series someday!",Courtesy lighting under the door handles!  Push button engine start-stop.,None.
4.875,What a Fun Ride!,M.J. Smith ,03/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I was looking for a car that was fun to drive and the 135 fits the bill. The six-speed manual is a welcome change of pace from the ordinary and makes the twin-turbo a pocket-rocket. The sports suspension is firm but still very comfortable and the handling is superb. I'm 6'4"" and there is plenty of room for me to change gears and maneuver. The profile of the car is spectacular and has already gotten a number of positive comments. If you are looking to get into a Bimmer that is all about fun, this is the car for you.","Six-speed manual, twin-turbo engine, sport package, built-in bluetooth",Cup holders in an awkward position when changing gears
