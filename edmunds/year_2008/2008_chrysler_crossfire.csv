5,Great Handling Car,sportcarman12 ,03/18/2012,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,we bought our Chrysler Crossfire Limited convertible in december 2010. I was amazed by the looks of the car & was impressed with the prefromance & handling. So far we have had no problems with the car but we change the oil every 3 thousand miles and you get better preformance if you use the best oil you can find. Yes on road trips the tires are loud but that doesnt matter because everything else about the car comprimises for the loud tires. we launch from 0-60 im 5.6 seconds & the breaking on the car is just amazing. Those of you who are looking for a very good sports car for a low price this would be the car for you. You can get the srt-6 used for 22k or get the regular for 15k-25k. ,"Convertible top, exterior desgin, car preformance, and the trill of driving this car.",none that i can think of.
3.625,Identity crisis,Crossfireowner ,09/30/2010,,,2,4,3,5,,4,3,4,4,"This german mutt has lost its identity in exchange for economy and American drivability. All sport car compromises for just some of the fun. PROS: -Grin inducing sticky turns. Almost no body roll. -Styling is great to ""tragically unique"" -Bulletproof Mercedes parts. -Sporty suspension might be a con to some, a definite pro to me. CONS: -Tire noise from it's $220 (!) huge rear tires is understandable. Wind noise and plastic creaking from its cheap interior is not. -Steering is numb, pedals are squishy. -Impossible in rough weather. -Standard coupe compromises, trunk, leg room, ect. -6.5sec to 60MPH is just okay. -Blind spots are workable, but still there.",Bought mine with 30k miles for 15 grand. What else are you going to get at that price? But does that automatically make it a perfect 10/10? Get real.,"Fix the numb steering and squishy pedals and we're getting somewhere great. As it stands this is a good car that's great for the price, but definitely not a great car. My advice is to ignore the 10/10 reviews with complaints of cup holders if you're looking for a ""drivers car""."
4.5,Personal Bang for the Buck,Bob out West ,09/17/2009,,,4,5,5,4,,5,4,4,5,"Mercedes chasis (albeit older) and handbuilt coachwork with more art in its tail than 99% of the entirety of other cars on the road.  This is entirely impossible for less than $50k, let alone the price at under $25k.  My history includes a Jag, Tiger, Jensen, X 1/9, 2 Mustangs, CRT (manual) and more, and the fun/comfort quotient on this ride dwarfs them all.  Some say that this is more of a boulivardier than a sports car, but it is rock solid, planted like an oak on the road, and goes like scat.   Blind spot and rear view sounds bad, but after 1k driving it becomes second nature and unannoying. Cup holder is less than useless, Nav and radio both hopelessly outdated. ","Go-kart feel.  Seating position once settled.  Style.  Buy this car if you're 19 inside and a late boomer on the outside.  Creature comforts are fine, but more 90's than naughts.",N/A.  Although I made some of my own.  Discreet low side stripe and upgraded head unit (radio).
4.625,A Fun to Drive Car,Richard ,08/25/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I've always wanted a 2-seat convertible and my wife and I chose the Crossfire.  We bought this car new in March 2008.  Sticker was 41,500, we got it for 32,000 total (tax, title, etc.) and are very happy with the car.  The best feature of the car is the styling - very unique.  I get positive comments most everywhere I go.  Have a bad day at work?  Do as my wife and I - drop the top, go for a ride in the country and you'll be smiling.  This car is comfy for a short wheelbase, 2-seater, the seats too.  I plan to keep this car for a long time, as is my custom.  If you own a Crossfire, join the Crossfire International Car Club Inc. (Google CICCI) - you won't regret it.  ","The styling, convertible top, 2-tone interior, flip-up spoiler and the Mercedes engine, transmission, suspension, etc. underneath the Chrysler-designed body.","The cupholder is nearly useless, a few too many plain plastic parts (such as the door lock posts) that are out of place in a $35,000 car."
4.5,So Far So Good,Bobbylew ,08/22/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,I am very happy with my car. It handles great and so far is quite dependable. Watch out for the trunk lid. I made the mistake of leaving it half way closed after getting something out of the trunk and I wound up killing the battery. When I purchased the car the one key didn't work. The dealership had to get the replacement from Mersedes and they told me it would have cost me $150. for me to buy one if it wasn't under warranty if say I lost mine. I haven't had  any other problems so far.,"My favorites, Looks, How it drives, The convertible top. Unlimited powertrain warranty, Mileage. It gets around 25 mpg. Great pickup.",Better cupholder
4.875,An Enthusiast's Vehicle,Mike ,07/16/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've never driven a ""sports car"" in my life.  I felt the need and felt I'd be too claustrophobic for it.  I've been driving SUVs for the past 15 yrs and felt no reason to switch.  As a likely symptom of my midlife crisis (??), I found myself wanting a new car.  Not just any car.  I wanted a different car -- in a true sense of the word.  I didn't want a Lexus or BMW.  I was quite smitten with the look of the Infinite FX35.  It was different and cool.  I drove one.  I was completed deflated.  It was a boring ride.  Then, I saw Crossfire. I felt stimulated and intrigued.  I went and drove one.  I was hooked.  It was gorgeous and different on the outside.  Driving made me feel something powerful","The drive.  It makes me feel sturdy, stable, and intensely powerful.  It's kind of an aphrodisiac.  The exterior design.  It's a statement of boldness.  ","The interior is spartan, very spartan. It could have been a lot more refined.  The seats could have used better leather like you'd see in, yes, Lexus or BMW.  "
5,No Comparison Anywhere...,M.Heiden ,04/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This car is ""proof"" positive of how over rated Toyota and Lexus are.  This car looks great, drives great and was more than reasonable to purchase.  I refuse to drink the Kool Aid and believe that everything from Japan is great...  This is my second one, a 2005 coupe and now a convertible.  My last Corvette almost rattled my teeth out of my head, and my kidneys still don't work properly.  I think I'll buy one more and leave it in garage for when these wear out at 200k...","Power top, incredible looks, and a nametag that is American....yeah I know the guts are German...",Cupholder is weak...
5,I love it !,TomD ,01/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought my '08 in mid December in NY and drove it home to South Texas as an early Christmas gift to myself! Great price (15k discount) and great car. Very solid machine and inspires confidence. Everything works as it should and I am very, very happpy with purchase. Average gas mileage on 1750 mile trip was 25.3 mpg, nearly all interstate. Make sure your bill of sale says new! I see some new ones for sale (by Chrysler dealers) as used, even with only 10 mi. on the odometer, to avoid the lifetime powertrain warranty to the original owner. Be careful!","Looks, distinctive styling, solid construction. Mostly Mercedes components. Rare in this area. Expect low depreciation after first 4 years. (My poor condition 1981 Delorean is worth more than I paid for it; not nearly as good a car as the crossfire.) Look at prices of 2003 Thunderbirds.","N/A since 2008 was last year. However, long doors make parking in tight spaces difficult to impossible.  Blind spots are bad; I added 2"" convex mirrors to both outside mirrors.  8.5 quart oil capacity will be expensive. Navigator is not good; I use my window mount Garmin instead. "
4,Love it,Orlando Realtor ,12/06/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,3,3,4,"Had to downsize from a 06 Vette, (times are tough for realtors) Love my new Crossfire which I bought for 22k with only 1200 miles. Spoiled as I am from the Vette I truly lo the styling. Everyone in the office said they liked it better than the Vette, looks like my bosses 500SLK without the price, test drove one of those too and still decided on a Crossfire. Haven't tried the navigation yet and miss it from the Vette. Seats stink comparably, however with a lumbar pillow I suffice. Flawless power top although it's slow. Decent stereo for the price. Good pickup even if its not lightning fast. Stupid cool active spoiler makes people look. Love the side fins! Half the payment of the Vette so I'm very happy","Side fins, spoiler, dash, concept car look, still get compliments all the time! Price! 22k with 1200 miles I stole it!","Better cup holders, 6 disc CD, Power lumbar, heads up display "
4.5,Fun to Drive,Len ,11/26/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,4,4,5,"I bought this vehicle new some 10 months ago. I use this car exclusively for pleasure driving and consequently have less than 3,000 miles on it. The car handles well and is fun to drive on back roads. It lacks raw power and is not a head-jerker off the line. The auto transmission is slow to shift. I don't regret buying this car but would buy a Vette if I had it to do over again. But the price difference between the Crossfire and Vette is steep - I believe the Crossfire is a better value for the buck.     ",Low profile and spoiler look great. Power top operates flawlessly. Quick steering. Tires grip the road well. Factory warranty,Increased power/torque CD changer Usuable cup holder (a must on a $40K car) More aggressive exhaust tone 
4.75,My wife loves her new Crossfire,caremanager ,08/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"We are very happy with our Crossfire. My wife could have picked any convertible she wanted in the $40k range. She chose the Crossfire because of it's beautiful styling and head turnablity factor. She absolutely loves her car. What made it even better yet was the incredible deal we got on this vehicle. We just couldn't say no to the $29,900 price tag for this fully loaded car. No other convertible even came close to that price with this many features. The time is right to get this end of model year German built sports car.",Two tone interior and unique body styling.,Cup holder and a 6 disc CD player would be nice.
4.875,Absolutely Love it!,Andrea ,06/03/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was looking for something sexy to replace my Jeep Liberty and certainly found it in the Crossfire.  It's gorgeous, fun, and gets much better gas mileage. Of course, it helped that the dealership knocked $12K off the list to sell it...and yes, it was brand new!  Is it worth the list of $37K? No and that's why they're discontinuing them.  But, for $25K? Absolutely!","Looks, ride, and gas mileage","MP3 stereo would have been nice, but this is the last year for the Crossfire."
4.75,Love It,Zoom ,04/25/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Love the design,  very comfortable for a two seater.  Loads of trunk space (for a 2 seater).  Can easily get two golf bags and weekends worth of gear in it.  Not a drag racer but has plenty of giddy-up.  Reasonable cost after good discount.  If you love it, keep it since the resale value is almost nothing.  ",Looks and ride.,None
2,Don't get one,"John, NY ",03/17/2008,,,2,4,1,2,,2,1,2,2,"Everything was very poor. I wish I had ordered a different vehicle. I am stuck with it as the residual is so low, that it may still be negative when the loan is paid off",,Stop making it
