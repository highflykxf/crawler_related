5,Love My Cute Lil Car,Lani S Gomer ,06/14/2016,5,4,4,,,5,5,5,4,,,"I bought her brand new and now she has 58,000. She is garage kept and has her regular maintenance. I've never had any major issues. I believe there were 2 or 3 recalls which the dealership fixed right up with no problems. One of the dash lights where there gas gauge is located died about 2 years after I got her but it wasn't worth the price to pay to have it fixed, I can see the gauge with no problem so that never became a real problem.  She is super fun to drive, so much so my husband likes to drive her on the weekends. She's zippy, easy to handle, small enough to fit just about anywhere but yet it's roomy enough to fit a bike in the back with the back seats down. The AWD is great, we live in Central Florida and get lots of rain and I've always felt safe. My teenage daughters learned to drive in my car and have always felt comfortable. If I could I would buy a newer model but for now I will stick with my lil baby. When I see her in the parking lot I still think she looks so cute, sporty and fun. Mine is pearl white and has tinted windows which makes it look really sharp. When I see others without the tint I think it looks unfinished for some reason.Now the cons on her are all cosmetic. I still have the factory stereo which sounds great but there isn't a USB or Aux input for my iphone so I had to purchase a compatible plug which wasn't a problem. I'm sure I'll probably put a bluetooth stereo in soon. The other con is no front arm rest, so I purchased one online that sits in the middle holder and has a compartment. Also it seats 5 but the back seat isn't really comfortable for 3 adults. I got lucky and had 3 children but they did always complain it was uncomfortable and the headrests had to be raised up which was bad from me as the driver because I had a hard time seeing out the back window.I love this car and will love her til she gives out on me which hopefully won't be for a long time.",,

Drop it into 4th on the highway and you have plenty of passing power. On back roads, it clings to gravel and dirt, and it handles great in snow (assuming you actually know how to drive in snow). This car has walked through mud, snow, tall weeds, and easily navigates city streets (drove it through downtown Chicago with ease). The newer six-speeds lack the snap and downshifting is finicky, so I'll be keeping my 5-speed rather than trading up. Best car in its class, especially for the money.","The selectable drivetrain (FWD, AWD or 4WD).
The responsive 5-speed transmission shifts well both up and down; much better than the 6-speed in newer models.
It has more sure-footedness and handling in all situations, including dirt roads and snow, than the Rav4 and CRV (I have owned and driven all three). It is on par with the Forester.
Hatch wide enough to store optional crossbars (whether hauling kayaks or IKEA boxes ... ).
","Less-sensitive/delicate tire sensors (often come one even when tires are inflated properly).
Better visibility between windshield and door window (the A-window is too small) -- rounding corners can cause blind spots.

At first, it felt very slightly underpowered, considering that I was used to driving a car with 260 horsepower, but in reality, it isn't bad. The handling on it is amazing. It takes turns quickly and the tires stick to the road well. I live in Pennsylvania, and the traction control and AWD make it a very good car for snow. Also, the touring package comes with a 9-speaker 6-CD changer, which sounds amazing. It is probably one of the best car stereos I've heard.

It is spacious for a small car with plenty of room in the trunk for a full size suit case laid down flat.  The car lacks power which they advertise as more than a MINI, but you really have to put your foot into it or use gear 1 to launch it and to merge onto Interstate traffic.  Radio is sufficient (4 speaker single Cd player)  Head room is great for tall people we are not  AWD is not perm. but can be locked in as long as driving below 30mph.

The interior ""plastic"" (dash, doors)scratch extremely easily, and the upholstery snags like mad as well.  The little windows on the front sides create blind spots.  The window sticker when I bought it said avg mpg 30 highway and I have not ever gotten above 25-26mpg.  Small gas tank. Cruise control is not standard neither are arm rests.

Its been very comfortable, fairly reliable, and still gets looks and compliments on its styling. Rear seat needs to fold down. At first, I thought that the trunk was huge, but the lack of a fold-down rear seat is a huge pain. Rear seat legroom is tight, and you will need BOTH hands on the wheel on windy days.

I never understood it when people said a car can be ""fun to drive"" until now. The shifting is smooth and seamless, the car is very peppy and responsive and the acceleration leaves nothing to be desired. I enjoy getting in my car to go anywhere now. The quality of the car is great too. It feels solid and firm and is solid on the road. The cockpit is roomy and very comfortable. The stereo system and sound is just right.

The car is actually fun to drive with unique style and its easy to own I have had this car for about a year now and I have had no issues with the car so far. This has been one of my favorite cars to own so far. The 4 speed auto is a bit sluggish to respond and the lack of an auto stick type trans was a bit disapointing but it still gets the job done. There is just enough horse power to get you onto the highway and above legal posted limits quickly so this car is no slug.

I have gotten up hills that other cars were slipping and sliding on. The traction control and anti-lock breaks have kept me going in a straight line when other cars in front and behind me have been fishtailing. In addition to being very reliable and safe, it is a blast to drive. It is so comfortable that my husband always wants me to drive even though his Saturn gets better gas mileage. I'm averaging 27 MPG and I drive 100 miles a day back and forth to work. I test drove a Honda Fit and Civic because they got better gas mileage but they just didn't feel as substantial as the SX4.","AWD, traction control, ABS, CD player plays WMA - I get 12-16 normal CD's on one WMA CD so with a 6 CD changer I'm carrying almost 100 CD's in the car at a time.",Larger gas tank

The Cobalt would have cost $20 less a month (purchase), but was the no- options, manual-windows-and-all version in white (no other colors available at that dealer). The Mazda 3 was fun, and well optioned. But it was $20 more a month. The Nissan was funny. Neat interrior, but weird seats and looks. And it was about $30 more a month. Now, the Suzuki SX4 Sport had all the options of the Mazda 3, the cool interior similar to the Sentra, and only a little more expensive than the base-model Cobalt. The paint is fantastic, I got the dark grey. And it drives like a sport sedan. ","I love the large 17"" tires on rims, the biggest of all the vehicles I compared it to. Evidently this is stock, not an option. And the interior feels like a cockpit with the neat triangular windows ahead of the A-pillars. The high roof fits a 6-foot person like me well. And the stereo is great.","No stock input for an MP3 player. Requires the purchase and install of a $180 interface. The enormous ""S"" on the grille seems too big for the face of the car. Should be smaller. Non-folding rear seats does give the car rigidity (there are frame braces there instead of a hole), but is uniquely odd. "

Being my first new car it has been the best compared to my 91 Lincoln Mark 7 and my 95 Mazda 626. It feels like you're doing laps around a go-cart track. It's always eager to downshift wich makes it hit that right note at all times. My mom even wanted to borrow it and she has a 07 BMW 3 series. She loved it until she crashed it. Wasn't anything major but the front bumper, radiator, grill and headlight needed replcing and she still rides the same if not better then the day I got her. It's funny how the first accident my mom's ever gotten in. It had to be my brand new SX4 but you wouldn't even notice the dealership did an excelent job, another great thing about SX4","I love the way it take curves, it gets the addrenaline pumping compared to my old cars. The 17's are a definite plus, compared to others that mostly only come with caps. One thing ide suggest is to look at it coming up fast in the rearview mirror.

So far we have put nearly 5000 miles on the odometer with no issues. Our sedan has the optional 17"" black painted wheels with machined face and they really set the car apart. With the addition of front fog lamps it looks great. So far gas mileage is on par with the sticker but we have yet to get over 30mi to a gallon even on a 175 mile one way trip to the beach we never got over 26mi to a gallon.

We can fit a full size car seat in the middle with a booster seat on each side in the back with no problem.,I think the interior is cheaply made from thin plastic and could stand for improvement. The stereo system is not the greatest either. I have already replaced all the speakers with Infinity pieces and still find the system to be poor in sound quality. There is room for improvement.

Fits our growing family of 5 (4 adult size and one child)comfortably enough for short trips. Good on gas (getting 21.5 city driving). Lots of trunk space. Can't wait to see how it handles in the snow. For a 4 cylinder vehicle, it does great on hills.",Like it all! Good on gas.

(Big guys know what I mean.) I can easily open the door in the parking garage and slip in and out since the doors are so short. Glass everywhere. Feels like a greenhouse.

I have read lots of complaints about road noise, for example, but I find it to be a quiet and smooth cruiser for its size. Careful driving has given me an overall mpg of 30. (Quick starts and remaining in a lower gear will drop the mileage quickly.) The instant mpg readout helps you re- adjust driving habits. Staying under 70 on the highway also yields very good numbers. It handles great and is ""toss- able,"" adding to the fun factor. Plus, parking is a breeze.","The stereo volume adjustment with speed, the sub-woofer, key-less go, red instrument lighting, 17"" wheels, the great mileage considering it is an AWD vehicle, and the copper/root beer color.","Please add (at least as optional) some seat adjustments (height, lumbar), heated seats, lighted steering wheel and door controls, side rub strips to prevent door dings, a lighter colored interior choice, a 6th gear for lower highway revs, a sunroof, and one touch down and up on both front windows."

My first complaint is that the acceleration really is poor, but the vehicle handles corners very well which helps equal out the poor acceleration. The vehicle's IAWD and 4X4 lock works well and the vehicle is virtually impossible to get stuck in snow or mud.",My favorite feature of the vehicle is the I-AWD system and the original look of the body.,The vehicle could use more horsepower to help out with the acceleration.

I'm getting 28 MPG driving back and forth to work. I do wish it had a bigger gas tank because with the miles I drive (over 400 a week) I have to fill up twice a week, but otherwise I love this car.

This car keeps getting great reviews from friends, not to mention the great perks it came with, and the much needed, built-in bluetooth system. On a normal work week, I used to fork out about 60 bucks for gasoline (California), Now after the first week of owning and driving the car guess what?

5,My Little White Tank,CtYank42 ,12/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5," This is my third Suzuki automobile, having owned an 88 Chevy Sprint and a 93 GEO Metro.  While the little three bangers were great on gas, and very dependable, they weren't nearly as well built and fun to drive as my SX4 Sport.  One of the reasons I bought another Suzuki - my seventh including four motorcycles - is the build quality of the Japanese built models.  I considered a Forenza and a Verona but I wasn't comfortable with the quality control reports on the South Korean built cars.   My SX4 Sport has two wheel drive (all the four sedans are 2WD) and it handles better than any small car I've ever owned, including an 02 SVT Focus.   I haven't averaged less than 31MPG in 3000 miles. Fun",This car is an absolute blast to drive.  I haven't ruled out competing in SCCA SoloII autocross events next year.  The 17 inch alloy wheels and premium 50 series Dunlop tires add to the driving pleasure. The comfortable interior is surprisingly roomy and the trunk is huge. Best value for the money. ,I'd like to see a fold down rear seat even with the steel cross bracing. Long objects like ladders etc. would fit easily.
