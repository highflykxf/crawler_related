No issues with maintenance, and never ran across any major problems (even after 100k mi). The interior is somewhat simple but has nice accents, and is very roomy inside for big folks like me.

He said a solution is to remove the moulding and glue and buff out the paint. His estimate was $240.00. I'm disgusted that this problem should occur on a $40,000 vehicle.

This GMC outperforms the ford in every way possible.  I never thought I would say this considering my grandfather, my father, and I have been ford guys our entire lives but the proof is in the way the truck drives, handles, pulls, and the reliability I have experienced with this truck.

I don't tow but it will haul a back end load of hunting equipment, dogs and coolers full of meat.  Honestly, I could use a lesser truck for most of what I do, but when I need to step up this truck takes it and keeps going.

While I really don't need it for towing at this point, I can only imagine how great of a towing vehicle this will be.  I am very impressed with the power of the Duramax diesel, as well as how quiet it is compared to the Ford Power Stroke and the Cummins in the Dodge.  I test drove all 3 brands, and what won me over was the performance and power of the Duramax, as well as how much smoother the Allison Tranny shifted over the transmissions in the Dodge and Ford.

3.25,A Decent Truck With a Poor Drivetrain,Kevin H ,12/28/2009,,,4,4,4,4,,3,3,2,2,"This is a decent truck, but NOT with the 6.0 and GM 6 speed.  You HAVE to get the Duramax if you need a 3/4 ton truck.  The gas motor with fly by wire throttle, and GM 6 speed, is a horrible combination.  It is a death trap when trying to merge with traffic, especially in conditions when you are on and off the throttle.  There is up to a 3-4 second lag where absolutely no throttle input is given to the engine, no matter how hard you press on the accelerator.  I believe GM implemented this so their tranny wouldn't explode.  The engine and tranny computer work together, and the tranny computer tells the engine computer to not give any throttle until the tranny is ready (it never is).","Good styling, decent interior, great towing capacity (get the diesel unless you plan on having a fuel tanker follow you), and tie down rails in bed of truck.","Fuel mileage is not good.  12mpg in town, and 15 on the highway (at best, towing nothing).

2.75,Needs Help,Totally unimpressed ,06/17/2009,,,4,5,1,1,,1,5,2,3,Before buying this truck I owned a F250 V10.  This truck was supposed to have 50 more hp and comparable torque but its lack of power is remarkable.  My mpg is ok until I hook something behind it then its 5mpg...  I have had no less than 20 warranty claims in 1 year.  It absolutly can not handle any hitch weight without bottoming out.  The sheet metal used to form the body is so thin the smallest bump and you have a dent.  I really had high hopes that GM had a great truck but after the trans went out @ 6500 miles and many many other issues I'll admit I was wrong..

3.25,Not a fan,notafan ,02/14/2009,,,4,4,2,2,,5,4,2,3,The fuel economy of this truck leaves a lot to be desired. My truck is GPS'd so I am only able to drive the speed limit without getting in trouble. The best I have ever got for fuel economy is 14.8 mpg (imperial gallons). The quality of the truck is less than desirable. In cold weather (less than -20c) the back doors will not latch completely without slamming them hard. I actually knocked the molding off the door trying to get it latched. When the doors are closed they squeak and rattle so bad you have to turn the radio up. I have had to install a second battery to get the truck to start after sitting for more than 3 days. The airbag computer already stopped working and needed replacing.,The interior ergonomics is nice. I really like the self dimming mirrors. Seats are what is expected from GMC (very comfortable). Sounds good at the exhaust pipe.,Fuel economy would be nice. Quality need to be built into this truck. How about a rear bumper that actually takes a hit and doesn't fold like a cheap lawn chair.

I have not had this kind of acceleration since my '61 Vette'. There are no rattles or any fit/finish problems. Only oil changes and tire rotation.

At first I had a problem with the transmission not downshifting easily in the 25-50 mph range, but the dealer flashed the ECU and now it's more responsive (although a bit less smooth- shifting - before it was like silk).
