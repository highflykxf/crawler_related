Other issues not yet addressed: soft engine knock (piston slap?), timing chain rattles briefly when engine not started for several days, plenty of interior rattles, and of course paint chipping.

3.625,Lexus could  really do better but didn't,ChuckHall ,08/22/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,1,3,1,If you love the feel of the road then you will love this series of Lexus because due to the stiff suspension you will feel every bump in the road.  If you are broad in the beam get a different car.  When I drove the car I had to shift my position numerous times to feel comfortable - the seat is not wide enough for a larger than average person.  There is a wind noise on both sides of the windshield that should never be heard from a car in this price range - and owners of the same style Camry have reported the same noise as well but Toyota/Lexus report that this is normal.  If you are long waisted (short legged) get a different car - it is impossible to adjust the height for comfort.,The car goes like a bat out of hell and will stop on a dime.  Great air conditioning but the heater had a hard time maintaining the proper temperature. The tilt and telescoping steering wheel on entry is a nice touch. The tilt down side mirrors in reverse are fun - for awhile - then distracting.,The car needs softer padding in the seat or Lexus needs to offer cloth seats.  If you love the exterior look of the car buy a Camry and save yourself some money because they are almost identical. It also needs a softer suspension if you are going to do much driving on LA freeways.  A disappointment.

Has a good ride, not as quiet inside as I would have expected, dealership says it's the wind shear from the side mirrors! When I have to accelerate a bit hard, the catalytic converter smells really bad.  I had this problem with my 2005 es300 too. Does anybody else experience this? Also the driver's side seat belt buckle digs into the back  of the seat and marks up the leather when you get in the car. The  heated seats don't get very warm as other cars  I  have drove with this feature.  The bluetooth does not always work properly.  The front tires wore out at 10K and I did have them rotated by the dealer.  The paint scratches very easily. Major torque pull could have accident.","The headlights are nice and bright.

The steering is too light, it has a nervous feel when cornering. The transmission has not been fixed since the 2007 recall. It down shifts very abruptly and shakes the whole car. It drives smooth and gets good gas mileage. The center console is an engineer's joke. It always opens (what where they thinking with that button). Hopefully not the same guy that developed the engine with the Diesel noise. I can't say I will buy another one. This was my first Lexus. Oh, and the paint scratches with just a wash. At this price point you have to pay for XM satilite. The Chevy Cobolt comes with it for $11,000. PLEASE!","Looks, ride, heated and cooled seats. Nice interior space.

The gas mileage is better than expected.  I average around 24 mpg (mostly city driving).  On the highway, I get 30 - 35 mpg.

Each time I looked at other options, including the BMW, Mercedes, etc., and chose Lexus. For me, it was the best value for the money, providing the luxury and comfort that I wanted. Quite frankly, I am more interested in a luxury ride than a sporty one.  I have never had a problem with any of the cars. My only wish for the Lexus was a little more of a sportier feel which the ES 350 achieves and then some.  ","The nav system is a complete upgrade, positioned better and clearer than before. The interior is sleeker with  beautiful contours and the exterior is finally distinct from the Camry. ",I am very happy with the car and would not change a thing.
4.5,Not a driver's car,arnie ,05/19/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,2,"Great fit and finish, quality materials, outstanding fuel economy; the only down side is the car has lousy cornering capability; I may go Infiniti next time.",Seating and general build quality,This car needs attention paid to the suspension; had I really exercised the car prior to purchase I would not have selected this car.
5,Super Value,Lexus/Charlotte NC ,05/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my third Lexus.  I have received this model as the loaner during service at our dealership over the last 7 years and am impressed at the changes between the ES300, 330 and this one.  The ride is sportier and quicker than previous models without sacrificing comfort.  The relative value is unbeatable.  The price for what you get is pretty much unmatched in any other cars I looked at in this price range.  Reliability is also going to be better than BMW and Mercedes.  I highly recommend this car.","Acceleration, comfort, steering, quiet cabin.",Move center console button to a spot where the average driver's elbow rests.  I keep popping mine open accidentally.  Old habits are hard to break!  Premium radio could use an upgrade (definitely not Mark Levinson).
5,The Greatest,Charliern9 ,04/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I leased a 06 ES 330 but was disappointed that I didn't wait a few months for the 07. In 07 the car was redesigned and greatly improved, especially in the power category. No comparison to the 06 in that area. I absolutely love my new 08 and the Lexus service is unmatched from any other car manufacturer I've ever dealt with.I only had a couple of complaints with the 06 but as of now I have no complaints whatsoever with this baby.This is one fine automobile and to quote my ex, it's ride is as smooth as butter. My car is now referred to as the ""buttermobile"".",Power and style; very comfortable seats that are heatd and cooled as desired. Like the rear window shade and the redesign of the console and the layout of the interior controls.The bluetooth and iPod capability.,If I had to identify something i guess I'd hope for alittle better sound system without having to upgrade 1K for Lexus premimum system.
5,New and loving it!!,rjt65 ,04/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had this car about 2 weeks.  I absolutely love it. The ride is firm but cushioned. Handles very well.  On long highway drives getting about 30 MPG, overall in 20s.  A luxurious ride and interior.  I am over 6' 1"" with wide shoulders, long legs so the spacing is important for me.  Sitting on the cross Bronx for 2 hours due to an accident was made much more enjoyable by this car.      ","Mark Levinson upgraded stereo rocks. Panaromic roof, navigation system w/handsfree bluetooth phone connectivity works excellent.  Obsidian black w/black interior looks great, perforated front seating for AC and heat.  Very roomy trunk.  Parking assist with back-up camera.",Only improvement is for the front interior HID lights to produce more interior lighting or add other interior lights for more lighting.  They look great but don't produce much light if you are looking on the floor for something.
4.875,Third Lexus,michelle ,03/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"This is my third Lexus and the experience so far has been favorable. At first I was concerned with the keyless start because I felt I would lock myself out of the car, but now I am used to this feature.  The car rides smooth and quiet and the seats are comfortable.  The extra horsepower is also noted as an improvement.",The car handles well in the snow and rain.  I also feel very safe in this car.  I avoided a major accident because the braking system in this car is excellent. ,I did not upgrade my stereo and am a little disappointed in the quality. Would also like to have blinker lights in the side view windows like Mercedes and Acura.  Would also like rear sunshade as a standard feature.
4.375,2008 Lexus ES 350,haleigh ,03/05/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,5,5,3,4,Comparing to my 2004 ES 330 it is a slight improvement. Keyless entry and telescoping wheel are nice additions. Engine/transmission are a slight improvement but engine is louder. Tires are not as good as was on 2004. Lexus has cut some corners hopefully not in area of reliability. Controls for interior lights are much too confusing and don't seem to make much sense. Battery is down graded from 2004. Center console is a joke compared with 2004. Manual shifting (s) mode is ideal for snowy/icy driving. Handling is just o.k. Four wheel drive might be a good feature for the future. Extra cost for an XM radio is rather high and location of special antenna is not good.,Keyless entry. Telelescoping wheel.,Install better tires. Go back to center console used on es350 2004. Make larger vanity mirrors.
4.75,Surprised at the mileage,Jay ,02/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by my city driving mileage.  At present I have just under 2000 miles on the vehicle and have averaged 23-24 mpg.  The mpg indicator helps me to manage my driving habits, I hope to exceed the 24 mark once the car gets a couple of thousand more miles.  I believe for the $ this vehicle is very tough to beat especially given the fact if I do need service it will be done at the Lexus level.  I am very pleased with the ergonomics, ride, styling, and performance.  I am recommending this vehicle to friends/family.",Keyless entry combined with the Interior accent lights upon approaching the vehicle.  Tremendous interior space.  The six speed transmission sets this vehicle apart from its competitors in the same price range.,"An iPod plug outside of the glove box along with a specialty plug for phone charging.  The bluetooth is hard to set up,  but it could be my phone that is causing the problem."
4.5,Small nitpicks in a near-perfect car,channing ,02/26/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,4,5,4,4,"Bought it over the Lunar New Year, got everything except Ultra Luxury package.  Drives like it should.  Have yet to take twisties but the car should be able to hold its own despite not being a sports sedan.  Otherwise, wonderfully smooth and quiet--and fast!  A few chinks in its armor of perfection: despite the stylish profile, the roofline is low as a result.  I am just under 6'1"" and I cannot sport an explosively spiky hairstyle in this car (I love contradictions).  The glove compartment is unlit, which can be an annoyance at night.","Rear-view camera, tilt-down mirrors, power-adjust steering wheel, gobs of legroom front and rear.  And that engine, what a monster in this moderate-profile luxury car!  So tempting to be a leadfoot!","Higher roofline desired; illuminate the glove compartment please, what a silly mistake.  A more foolproof center console button would also help."
5,Love it,dan ,02/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have had my ES 350 for a month now and I love it. I looked at a lot of other cars before buying this one and it is well worth the money. After buying this  I would recommend this car to anyone who is thinking about buying one.,"The gas mileage it gets, also the keyless system.","Center arm rest opens to easy botton should be moved, navagation needs some work for the voice com."
5,Happy with my choice - Lexus ES 350,Iris ,02/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love my 2008 Lexus ES 350, so quiet, comfortable, smooth, and saving a lot on gas - highly recommend this one for a luxury car.","No key, quietness, great performance.",Do not like the silver color for this model.
5,"Fantastic, except for the Navigation",L Cayes ,01/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I replaced a Mercedes E320 for the Lexus ES350. The Lexus is one of the smoothest driving cars I have ever owned. It is quiet, rides and handles great and gets great gas mileage. ","Ride, handling, quietness, quality, dealer attentiveness, heated seats, backup camera."," The Navigation system is not user friendly at all. If you are used to a hand held GPS you will be frustrated when using this system, and I am a retired 767 Captain. The voice recognition does not work well for me at all, and about 30% of the time the address enterred cannot be found."
5,Wonderful choice,wonderful choice ,01/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After test driving Accord, Camry, and Acura I choose ES 350 based on the reliability of owning a 2000 ES 300 for 8 years and I read 200 owner reviews.  I did not appreciate the heated/vented seats until I drove to LA and to Reno.  I was very impressed with the 32 mpg, instant acceleration, smoothness and attention to details. I just love, love driving my second Lexus. ",It looks and rides wonderfully well like a luxury car. The keyless ignition takes a bit of getting used to but a nice high tech feature.  The front air dam is the right height which prevents scraping coming out of my driveway.  ,The audio was better in my ES 300.  I wish the rear view mirrors would not tilt when reversing.  I wish I could fold down the rear seats and miss door/side moldings.     
5,My New Lexus,Holly ,01/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this car.  It is quiet, comfortable, responsive, and the added value of service at a Lexus dealer instead of a Toyota is pretty great.  I highly recommend this one!","no key, heated and cooled seats, comfort, performance, resale value, dealer service.",
4.875,Lexus ES 350... Big Fan,DT ,01/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,Traded in an 2006 Acura TL for the 2008 Lexus ES 350.  I loved the TL but I love the ES 350 that much more.  Totally diferrent drive as the TL is a much more aggressive car.  This car feels much roomier and everything put into the car is of top notch quality.  Little disappointed in the stereo but overall am very satisfied.  The gas mileage as well as the ability to not have to use premium gas is much improved over the Acura and the displays are very easy to read.,"Push button ignition, cabin illumination, navigation, back up camera, comfort.",Stereo system needs massive improvement for price of the car.
5,The Standard By Which I Measure All Cars,Mark B ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my second ES. I previously owned a 2004 ES 330 and found it to be a great vehicle. When the ES 350 was released I knew I had to have one. This car is so fun to drive and has all the bells and whistles you would expect, and more, in a luxury sedan at this price point. I appreciate the quiet ride and the improved power. The seats are insanely comfortable and all of the controls are right at my fingertips. The competition can't match the quality materials and handling of the ES 350. Lexus has an edge that the others can't match.",The nav system and the cooling seats. Here in Atlanta it's a must! The shifting headlights make it easier to see on windy roads and the bluetooth feature is great especially for me who communicates a lot for business while driving.,Center console button is in a bad spot. I'm not yet used to its position and I frequently open the console without intending to.
5,Great Ride - Great Car,Texas Buyer ,12/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought the '08 ES350 over the '08 C-Class , '08 new Accord, & '08 TL. Very happy with the car.  Extremely quiet and luxurious.  Very large interior. A bit larger car then I wanted, but that is a personal preference.  ","Great nav system and bluetooth phone works great through the system.  Asked several people, and they couldn't tell I was on a speaker.  Very quiet & smooth ride. Backup cam has a nice wide lens that lets you see well.","Turns off many navigation features when driving. Also turns off some audio features (mp3's burned to a disc - viewing the folders)  A bit annoying, but I understand why. Still allows for speed dial bluetooth which is nice. Also, a bit hard to see out the back."
5,I'm in love with my ES 350,car guy ,12/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Had the car for four weeks and still so very excited about it. Really look forward to driving it!! Just a pleasure to drive and operate all it's features. This car really coddles its driver and passengers. It feels like it's worth every penny of the price when you are behind the wheel. Takes curves and corners surprisingly well! Can't say enough good things about it!!,"Level of luxury, feature content, build quality, driving pleasure.",Reposition center console release button so it does'nt open while resting arm on console. More upscale wheels as standard equipment.
4.625,I'll buy again and again.,Kevin B. ,11/18/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I've owned the car for 5 weeks now. I love the quiet ride and the feel inside. I love the bluetooth option for it's safety and convenience. When I go easy on the gas pedal, I get 28 MPG overall. When I need to pass, the power is there. You gotta try it to believe it.","With the Bluetooth connection to my cell phone, I just push a button and say ""call by number"" and then say the number and it make the call.",The view out the rear window is somewhat limited. I take a good look behind the car before I back up.
5,It's definitely NOT a fancy Camry,LXS LVR ,11/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have been a Toyota fan most of my life and always thought a Lexus was a fancy Camry - Once I drove my ES 350 I knew I was so wrong. Interior fit & finish is flawless and the MPG is a consistent 27-28 in town and 34 on the hwy. Hard to beat this with 272 hp V-6. Problems I've read about transmission and others simply are not true at least with this car. My wife and I have to fight over who gets to drive it. It's quick, safe as can be and with a spoiler, gold package, large tires it's a real ""head turner"". It is truly a great car and the extras you get over a Camry XLE for example are well worth it. Resale value of a Lexus is awesome.","Interior, acceleration, looks, safety.",Door guards - I'm having some matching colored ones made
4.875,Fine Car,brad ,11/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"After 8 years with my volvo S-80 it was time for change. I looked at the new S80 and the Toyota Avalon. The S80 was much like my 2000 and too much money considering the questionable quality of my old car. The Avalon was a good driving car but seemed a bit boxy. Driving the ES 350 was the clincher. Fun, quiet, responsive and comfortable. The Lexus trunk is a better shape than either of the others and the opening much larger. ",The tilt-down side view mirrors in reverse and the auto dimming. The quiet ride. Quietest car I have ever driven. A responsive driving machine.,"The seat back is very comfortable but the seat itself could stand improvement. The ""key"" could be smaller. The front bumper could be higher. You have to be careful when parking with concrete stops. If they are a little high you scrape bottom. The transmission is not as smooth as my Toyota Solara. "
5,Best Car Ever,scott badeaux ,11/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased my ES 350 with the ultra luxury package. This car is the model of refinement. The interior is top notch with quality material throughout. It's one of the quietest cars I've ever driven. You cannot hear wind noise or road noise. The car has no rattles and is silent at highway speeds. The car rides very smoothly, but still handles very well. While it's no sports car, it handles better than most people would expect. With the 3.5 liter V6 you have more power than you could ever need. The car merges into trafic with ease, and passing on the freeway could not be easier. Even when you punch the engine, it's silent and does not intrude into the cabin.","Mark Levinson stereo is great. I love the isolation from the outside, and the ride quality cannot be beat. Fit and finish is top notch. I love the panoramic roof. ","None. This car, my second LS, is the best I have ever owned."

4.75,Love it,Mike ,10/18/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I am not a car fanatic nor do I know much about mechanics, performance, etc.  What I will tell you is that I just traded my 1997 Mercedez C280 in for the Lexus ES 350.  I drove the 2008 BMW 328, Mercedes C300, Cadillac CTS, Audi A4 and A6.  The Lexus is by far the most comfortable and quite ride.  More power then you could possibly need and the nav and audio system is a dream.  The car has a beautiful interior with too many safety features to list here.  Lets just say I love this car.  ","Seats, nav system, back up camera.",Would like to be able to active the automatic seat adjustment before I get into the car.

I also own an Acura TL which I love, but there is no comparison to the comfortable ride in the ES. Great car. I read all the reviews for the 07 and decided to wait for the 08s before I bought.  I have not experienced any of the problem with down shifting reported in the 07s. Be careful with the remote in your pockets against other keys.  It could accidentaly let the windows down.",The nav is great.  Took a while to learn the features. Cool seats are a plus in the state of NC. Great ride.,Make the remote where you have to press the open button twice and hold  to let the windows down from the outside instead of once and hold.
5,My second Lexus is better than my first ,Tom  Brennan ,10/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is the second new Lexus I have owned. I thought my 2004 was nice car, however, the new options and upgrades on the 2008 model 350 surpass my expectations. I highly recommend the options of the back-up trunk camera and the headlight system that moves as you turn. I cannot believe the coverage of the road. Performance, comfort, looks and increased HP again more than meets my expectations. I look forward to driving this car for many years to come.     ",,"I noticed that it is somewhat more difficult to determine MPH on the speedometer VS my 2004 speedometer. It would be nice if they would have put more divisions such as 50, 55, 60. Rather than the 50, 60. However, I'm sure I will get use to it in a short time.     "
5,Awesome vehicle,Geep1on1 ,09/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This of course is a rollover year for ES 350.  I didn't really notice the new mirrors, but I did notice the improved interior lighting.  Anyone that compares this car to a Camry needs to drive them both head to head.  From the moment you get in the ES 350, you know that you are in a luxury car.  I have owned 5 series BMW, Infiniti Q45 and I enjoy driving this car more.  I have read that people are complaining of throttle lag and indeed when I drove my friends 2007 ES 350 I noticed some lag.  He used regular gasoline in his vehicle.  With premium fuel I do not notice any lag. Mine is an 08, but I suspect the issue is type of fuel.",Fun to drive!  Beautiful Lexus interior.  Nav system is a techno-junkies dream.,"Audio system in the premium plus is a little weak.  Having issues with voice recognition on the nav, but overall I like it."
