5,Fun to drive and kept it's value.,Donna L. ,05/14/2016,5,4,4,,,5,4,5,4,,,Fun to drive and so useful.  Holds large grocery orders or gardening supplies.  Twice the driver side visor clip broke and twice the cruise control had to be fixed.  Only other problem was blue paint turned white in large spots on roof and hood.  Only happened in 8th year of ownership. Even with unsightly paint the trade-in value was $6600.  I was very impressed.  Replaced this car with 2016 Honda Fit-EX.   Loved original car and now love my new one.,,
5,"great little car, still going strong",Dee ,02/20/2016,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,4,,,"I brought my '08 Fit Sport used at 10k miles.  I love the small foot-print when driving in the urban area, fuel economy, exceptional cargo space, flexible backseat configurations, and most of all - Honda reliability.  I've only put 60k on it so far.  No major issues (knock on wood) with only synthetic oil changes every 5-6k miles as indicated by the oil meter.  Fuel economy is good at around 26mpg around town and 33mpg on hwy.  Nevertheless, these are still good numbers even though I've read 40+mpg on some other reviews.  I dont know much about car dynamics, but I feel the car steering is precise.  109hp is not excellent, but with manual transmission, it is way much more responsive than automatic transmission when stepping on the throttle (instead of hearing the engine revving, then the power comes in a second or two later).  After 7 years of ownership, I've started car hunting again in hope to get a subcompact/compact SUV.  However, I have yet found an ideal replacement for my beloved Fit.  Until then, I am still a happy Fit owner.  Things I like:leather-wrapped steering wheel (you wont get this now unless paying for the top-of-the-line trim model $$)Magic Seat!ergonomic & simple layout for audio controlseasy to read odometer & tachometer (love the blue color)Things I dislike:road noise - very pronounced on highways, especially compared to my sister's new 2016 Fit",,
5,2008 Honda Fit Sport 169k BULLETPROOF RELIABILITY,taushamccarthy@yahoo.com ,11/19/2015,5,5,5,,,5,5,5,3,,,"Seats are stiff - that's my only complaint. Like others have said, car is bulletproof reliable, has awesome cargo configurations, and no significant repairs. I have found the original tires to be meager - at best. I had to have them replaced at 40k miles. Brakes done twice, tires twice and that's it. Everything works on the car and the rear cargo seat configurations have been fantastic! I drive it like mad - cross country multiple times, which is when the stiff seats bug me. They don't bother me otherwise. The car is an economy car and mine is a manual, which gets me about 40mpg. I drive the automatic and felt like the manual got much better performance, but I also just like manuals. All my cars have been sticks - this one has a tight gearbox, which took some getting used to - but I have had no issues with the transmission (or anything for that matter). My gf has a 2009 with about the same mileage - it's also a manual. There's very little difference between them drive-wise. Sound is good and I love the USB. The rear seats fold flat or fold upright for better vertical space. I have been surprised what all I can fit into it. I have used it to move multiple times. It handles really well. I'm finished with grad school now and feel like it's time to trade up but I can't find anything that is as solid and fun to drive. All these newer cars seem to have issues OR get crappy gas mileage OR come with a huge monthly payment... so for now, I'll be keeping this one.",,

I will let it be known I've been the sole owner of this car and have all maintenance done at Honda (oil changes/inspections). Since passing the 150k mark I've had the car towed twice once for a bad fuel pump ($700) the second time because the accelerator coils and water pump went out completely. The second issue ended up costing around $1500 because valve adjustments and new parts. The check engine light has come on several times since and needless to say I'm now afraid of driving this thing down the street. So beware after 150k, it's a money pit!",,

I found the car to be exceptionally fun to drive, with insane cargo capabilities, and bulletproof reliability. I made so many great memories with this car and smile whenever I see one (in my color) on the road. My intense satisfaction was only dashed when I drove the new 2015 Fit I had planned to replace it with. Immediately, if felt like Honda killed my fun little car and I moved on to another car maker (I replaced with a 2015 Toyota Corolla S Plus).","Super responsive handling for the price  genuinely fun to drive. Great manual gear box (up to the Honda legend). Well positioned steering wheel with nice leather wrap (Sport model). Innovative folding seats that offered surprising cargo hauling dividends over and over in 7 years of ownership. Great rear end crash protection  I walked away after being rear ended at 35+MPH by a large SUV (the Fit was repaired well, and remained a solid performer). Very reliable  almost no unscheduled repairs in 150,000 miles. Outstanding resale value. ","The seats were not designed for comfortable long trips. I would get neck fatigue from being a ""bobble head"" on drives over 50 miles that I don't get on our other vehicles. Also, the seat material was not as stain resistant as other Honda's I had owned in the past  particularly on the otherwise attractive Grey inserts. Faded coffee stains remain for the life of the car (I recommend sheepskin seat covers). Finally, the car's feather weight doesn't make it a wise vehicle for mountainous snow driving unless you make an investment in top-performing snow tires."

Like some Honda's, this is a well built, functional car but not well engineered. I can't explain why Honda has a penchant for putting under-powered engines in their cars (like the 2.0L engine in early CR-V's), but here they did it again. 109 horsepower and 106 pounds of torque may be fine for over-taxed and over-regulated Europeans, but when you are competing with V-8's for lane space on American highways, 109 horse's relegates you to the slow lane.

3.375,Great if you only drive in the city,lucarescigno ,05/24/2011,,,5,5,3,4,,2,1,3,4,"I bought my Fit new in 2008. At the time, I loved it. Since then, its various issues have worn down my support for the vehicle. Now I'm considering selling it even though it's still pretty new. The ride quality and road noise are getting to me, and the car lacks certain basic amenities like cruise control (my fault for getting the base model), adjustable intermittent length for the front wipers (that's right, it's every 4 seconds or nothing), and any intermittent setting for the rear wiper (it's either on or off).",Handling is excellent. Super sharp and responsive. I can feel the road so much better than in most cars. Pedal response is sharp and responsive as well. Parking is extremely easy with such a small car. There's tons of cargo space for a car this size and the seat configurations are useful. Headlights are very good and gauges are easy to read.,"The ride quality is bad. You will be bounced around constantly. Road noise is like riding in an airplane beyond 50 mph. The AC works, but it's weak. Gas mileage is not bad, but it's not as good as you'd expect for such a small car. Not worth the trade off in size and comfort. I think one of the biggest problems is that the highest gear just isn't tall enough - the engine revs like mad above 55 mph. The driving position is bad too - the pedals are too close but the steering wheel is too far away. Think of this as more like a Smart car. Fine for the city, AVOID if you use highways. "

4.75,I like the fit more than my old Civic,ctscream ,03/07/2011,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,5,5,When my 1999 Civic was stolen and would have cost too much money to repair I was heartbroken. I didn't have much money at the time and couldn't afford to buy a new Civic (and the new ones didn't appeal to me) so I started looking at more affordable cars but really didn't want anything but a Honda. The Fit was a perfect match for me. What made me attracted to it was the hatchback and extra trunk space because I barely ever have passengers. When I had the Civic it was always a pain to fit things in the trunk and fold the seats down with only 2 doors. It felt cramped especially with passengers in the back seat. ,"Lots of cargo space, easy to fold seats, simple but quirky exterior shape, tight turning radius, fits in small parking spaces, great visibility out of all windows, defrosts and heats up quickly, tire pressure gauge, has a lot of pep, nice interior colors, extra protection with the ignition lock.

The best part... nobody wants to steal a Honda Fit!","I wish the carpet materials were more durable and stood up to wear and dirt better. My car is in pretty good shape but the dirt get stuck in the felt floor and is impossible to get out. Also the back of the back seats aren't really durable for a spot where you may put down a lot of cargo... everything gets stuck in the fibers. I wish the front drivers seat had a tilt option. My biggest criticism is for the newer Fits, they totally ruined the body shape in my opinion... too curvy and too much going on visually on the exterior and interior to the point where I might not want to buy a Fit in the future."

One of the few negatives I've noticed is the design of the rear roof posts.

Moreover, when the conditions are right, and you're not driving with a speeding ticket in mind, you can easily achieve well over 40+ mpg- I have.  I'm spoiled now to the point that ANYTHING below 34 mpg is BAD. One last thing - - the sound system in the car: awesome.  The sport's 4 mids and 2 tweeters are what surprised me most.

4.875,My best experience ever,damick ,08/10/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,This Sport Fit is just great. I have as much front driving room as I had in a Mercury Sable. Just excellent for a 2 person car. I love it cause the room in the back when the seats are folded down is awesome. This little gas saver is loaded from a base sticker. I mean everything. Stereo is the best sound I have ever heard in a car. If you want to drive in a manual mode in an automatic transmission you can control that with a touch of a steering wheel button. You can gear down fast to a stop. I have had it up against so similar cars I will not mention and this one has class to it. The Sport I speak of. use to pay $65.00 per fill up now only $38.00 for the same distance. Buy one you will enjoy.,Look you will see.

My second and third tanks have been slightly over 40mpg mixed driving.  I don't know where they get the EPA estimate of 28-34. I'm also very happy with how fun it is to drive (sport-car feel), the great gas mileage, and the interior space that feels like it rivals my wife's Escape.  Besides much better gas mileage than advertised, my 5 speed with the 1.5 liter engine has more spunk than my big old 6 cylinder Explorer does (or ever did).  When some say the Fit doesn't have enough power I'm amazed unless maybe they have the automatic which isn't quite as good on power or mpg.

The Sport trim gives the car a better look versus the standard model. While it's not a rocket, the engine has some pep and good torque. The hills in our area are no problem for motor. When the A/C is on, the small displacement of the engine robs some of the power. The handling is great for this little car.

Have been getting up to 44 mpg in ideal conditions, but usually in the mid to upper 30's with a mix. Strictly town it has been under 30mpg at times. So, mpg varies widely depending on how you drive and what kind of traffic.  The manual transmission is so fun to drive that mpg can suffer from that. (The best mpg is conservative driving.)  It has an amazing amount of cargo space and that is what really sold us on this car. We keep the back seats folded down almost all of the time.

Sure somethings could have been better, but for the most part, having standards doesn't make me ask the dealer to fetch a model that has all the features I want.

After such a good experience with our first Fit purchased at the end of March, we found we could hardly bear to drive our Dodge Grand Caravan; too ponderous and the gas mileage was atrocious.  The Dodge was a '99 with 120K miles and was beginning to need work.  We got an internet deal lined up for a Milano Red base 5-sp manual for MSRP and waited a month to get it.  So we are now a two Fit family.  My Democrat wife gets the Tidewater Blue Fit and with my Republican leanings I get the Milano Red Fit, so we are properly color coded.  Humor aside, these are truly great little cars with a wonderful combination of economy and utility.","Again, fuel efficiency (we are averaging 38 mpg for Fit #1 with a best tank at 44.9 mpg), almost as much fun to drive as my motorcycles on the twisties, tremendous utility and versatility, styling (we wanted another '08 over an '09), and Honda build quality and reliability.","After having lived with a Fit now for over three months, I am pretty happy with what it is and I can live without dead pedals and armrests.  As a real nit-pick, however, I had to replace those tiny valve cover caps with larger metal caps.  I kept dropping the OEM's through the wheel openings."

The Fits seats are actually some of the best I have sat in ever, much to my surprise coming from the Mazda which had chair height seats.  This car is NOT underpowered for every day driving, I live in the mountains of WV and so far the Fit has zero problems climbing hills in fifth gear.

Most of my driving is in town or suburban areas.  The 40 MPG was on a trip to Dallas. I don't like the silver color, electric windows, electric locks--but there was no choice.

4.625,My Little Big Car,D.Stephan ,06/28/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"I bought my Honda Fit after my 1997 Chevy Blazer's transmission went. I wanted to get something that had a much better fuel economy and better track record as far as maintenance (Honda). I also still wanted to have a vehicle that would allow for cargo in the back. The Honda Fit met all of the criteria. It is so easy to drive, and the fuel economy is great (remember I drive a Blazer, so this is a shock). The only thing that bothers me is the acceleration is delayed and it seems like it races before it kicks into gear. Maybe it's because it a 4cyl and I'm used to a 6cyl. I also have noticed it's worse when you have the AC on. Other than that, I love my Fit. I hope to have it for many years.",Great gas mileage. Agile smooth ride. Hatch back cargo storage. Side impact air bags (important if you have kids). Radio CD player. Ice cold AC. Large cup holders. Folding side view mirrors. Overall attractiveness.

It handled the mountains and 75 mph on the interstate just fine and 32 to 41 mpg to boot.  The lower economy occurred at 75 mph into a strong head wind.  This car drives bigger than it is, handles well, and the paddle shifters are fun when pushing the car on curvy roads.  I'm 6'2"" and I was comfortable for all 4300 miles.

The folding seats, great gas mileage, and the room inside makes this car a winner. My only complaint is that the windows need tint from the factory. Average mileage is 34 and I have gotten as high as 39. Handles great and rides good. Long trips are not uncomfortable. Would definitely buy another one. I use the car for commuting to work but now I use it for everything including the long trips.

The buyer is required to accept options whether they want them or not. I don't want electric mirrors, door locks, or windows. I do not want power steering.  There is no leg room for the driver if the seat is moved far enough forward to reach the steering, or if the seat is moved back far enough for good leg room the steering is too far from the drivers arms. I do not want side curtain or any other air bags. I absolutely do not want ABS and I will disconnect it. I would have liked variable speed intermittent wipers. Ride is harsh. Interior black color is hard to keep clean.",Fuel mileage and handling are very good. Price was OK but could have been lower if forced options were removed. ,Visibility is poor due to a pillars being to big. The new 2009 moves the windshield further forward for better visibility but I cannot understand how that will help. Windshield is too far forward and dash is too big.

I have taken my daughter (in a car seat), sister, her wheelchair, her service dog AND a cartload from Costco with two dog beds, and no one was cramped.

I considered hybrids but felt the premium paid to get this technology just wasn't worth it. All the subsequent research I did kept pointing directly to the Honda Fit.  I looked at the competition, but only ended up test driving the Fit.  After that I was sold on the car.  So far in the first 1000 miles, we have averaged about 37.5 mpg and with full break-in I'd love to push that over 40 mpg.  It gives me all the economy I was looking for and it is really fun to drive.  Now I wonder if we should trade in the Grand Caravan for another?","The economy ranks first, the ""fun-to- drive"" factor ranks a close second.  It is remarkable that it seems so big on the inside with such a small exterior volume.  The base model has all the features we require.  The ABS, side-curtain airbags and the excellent crash test ratings are another plus.","What many others have said.  Better quality carpeting would be nice.  Also, I do miss an arm rest.  The pedals could be a little better separated.  A trip computer would have been nice.  Despite these minor issues, I think we will have a long and enduring relationship with our Fit."

I prefer driving my Fit better than driving their gas guzzling money pits!  The Fit corners like it's on rails.

The engine, build quality, fuel economy, and fun to drive factor were all there.  However, the seating position and lack of a dead pedal left me feeling very uncomfortable.  The gas pedal is too close to the driver, which resulted in constantly lifting one's foot off the accelerator in order to properly control the throttle.  Move the seat back too far and you can't reach the clutch and steering wheel.  Also the lack of a dead pedal (or even a flat spot), leaves one's foot on a round bump.

It is very well designed and, as far as I can tell at this point, very well manufactured.  The interior space, when all the rear seats are folded flat, is amazing.  The front seats are fr more comfortable than they look, although the upholstery seems to attract every bit of fluff in the area.  It's not a vehicle that flourishes at high speeds; the engine becomes very busy and high-speed stability is not a strong point.  But for the purposes cited above, I know of nothing to equal it currently available on the market. ","Spaciousness, economy, utility.

I got my Fit for $50 over invoice which was hard to believe, if stories of $4/gallon gas this summer come true.  There are a lot of people driving big trucks and SUVs that get 10-12 MPG in real world driving that are going to be severely impacted.

In reality I'm getting 25 mpg and I drive mostly on the HWY. I hear this will get better in time. Right now Honda is purposefully not making many Fits to drive demand. Most dealerships are charging an additional 1500 to every car because of this false demand Honda is creating. Also the Fit does not come with floor mats. When you buy them you can't just lay them down but you need to cut into the floor of the car. What were they thinking with that???!!!  Overall I do like the fit. It's fun to drive and looks cool in my opinion. Its a Honda so I trust it will be reliable. Time will tell.,Fun to Drive Lots of Room (I can fit both bikes in the back) Good Performance on HWY I like the ,1) Arm Rest 2) Seats Fabric Current Fabric on Seats collect lint really easily. 3) Include the floor Mats and install them. 4) Improved MPG shouldn't be so hard on a car that small. 5) Don't create false demand.

4.875,Best Car We Could Have Bought,Don ,02/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"We needed a good commuter car that was reasonably priced and good gas mileage.  After reading all the reviews I could find, it became apparent the Fit was the way to go. We were sold on it at as soon as we test drove one.  In our area it was hard to find the Sport with the manual transmission. We love this car, it is amazing how such a small car can fit 4 large people fairly comfortably.  For the price it is the best deal out there. ",Just about everything.,Arm rest between front seats.
4.5,Pleasant  surprise,bpenn ,01/29/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,4,4,5,This is for anyone like me that was very hesitant to buy such a little car. I wrestled back and forth between the Civic and Mazda3 wagon. When I sold my gas guzzling truck for less than I hoped to get for it I only could afford the Fit. I've only had this a short time but I could not be happier with the Fit. This thing feels so much bigger inside then what it looks like. I find it to be a huge surprise and I'm relly digging this little thing. If you are walking the fence on this car I would suggest taking a long test drive. You may find what I found. This is a great car and Honda will have a huge hit on there hands.,Very comfortable and roomy interior. Paddle shifters are fun. Great gas mileage. Sport package steering wheel.,Little things like driver side visor mirror. Center armrest.
4.625,Over all a good car,700312 ,01/24/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"First, going from a V6 to a 4 cyl engine is a huge adjustment. The blue back lit display is very easy to read. Nice large display. My biggest complaint is that the engine does not like to accelerate. Especially from a stop. Once it gets going it is ok. I recently moved and being able to fold down the back seats flat helped a lot in moving. Given the attention to safety that Honda gives, it is too bad that the ABS, traction control, and stability control are not standard features. The steering wheel does not telescope so I am having to reach and there is no center console. I have been doing mostly city driving in heavy traffic so the gas mileage is not what it was advertised to be.       ",Fold down back seats for larger cargo area. The back seats also fold up like a folding chair so a bike or other object can be placed between the front seats and the back seats. The gas milage.  I can go 10-14 days without having to put any gas in the tank. With my other car it was every 5 days.,"Make the car 12-18"" wider and 24"" longer. A center console between the driver and front passenger. ABS/traction control/stability control as standard safety features. Tilt steering-not one that slides up and down.

4.5,It's a little buzz box,Bob Howland ,01/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,3,4,5,"Pro: Great space utilization. Quick and direct handling. Incredibly good gear shift linkage. Good interior controls. Fairly economical (33MPH in northern winter). Adequate horsepower for my purposes.  Con: Very short wheelbase yields a somewhat choppy ride. VERY firm suspension doesn't help. Lots of wind and tire noise at 75 MPH, so high that I won't use the radio above 65MPH. Geared short - 20MPH/1kRPM, which makes noise worse. Wanted to buy a set of snow tires the the tire pressure sensors double the per wheel cost. My 1997 Honda Civic got better gas mileage. I just wish I hadn't totaled it.",Steering and shift linkage.

The car is tight handling and the paddle shifters option works great as a way to zip around traffic without smashing the gas peddle.  I've had zero maintainence issues.  Honda did a good job at building a reliable and sporty Econo box.  ",The magic seats and the hatch back tray.

4.5,"2008 Fit Sport, Audio System",Portulaca ,12/25/2007,,,5,5,3,3,,5,5,5,5,"This vehicle handles well and is a joy to drive.  However, the road noise is greater than what I expected and the radio reception is unacceptable with constant static on local FM stations. The radio is fine as long as the car is not in motion.  It immediately begins to crackle when in motion.  The car has plenty of power for it's size and the gas mileage is wonderful. The head rests are set at a severe angle for short people and can't be adjusted unless a person removes them and reinstalls them backwards, with the angle toward the back seat.",Good seat belt placement (doesn't rub neck).  Great handling and fun to drive.,"This car has an inferior sound system.  I've been told there is ""nothing the dealer can do"" to improve the static that is constant on local FM stations.  I believe the antenna is too short to be effectively receive FM signals.  Honda needs to rectify this defect."

Gas mileage has been getting better as it breaks in and currently gets 35+ on a trip and 31 around town, all spirited driving. The car handles great and has proved itself worthy in slush and snow with the factory tires. The drive is Sporty and very enjoyable, decent comfort and stereo make the miles slide by. The interior is very versatile and convenient to access with no stretching and fishing to get things in and out. Build quality seems good. The low beams have been my only real complaint and I had to adjust the headlamps up a bit in thw hilly area where I live. They are pleny bright however.","The eager engine, great brakes, airbags all around, versatile interior space, good economy. The heater works great and all weather good mannered handling. Fun to drive!",The headlights need redisigned with a less sharp top cutoff on low beam. High beam is quite good.  Adjustable seat height and lumbar would be really nice.

4.875,More Can Cost Less,Archidive ,12/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Well overall I am VERY happy with this car. Last 5 vehicles were 2 Dodge Shelbys, 2 SUVs, and lastly my Acura RSX and I can say that the FIT offers something that I loved in each of those vehicles. I commute about 30 minutes one way in mixed driving in upstate NY. Only getting about 27 MPG which I'm a bit disappointed with since my RSX gave me 31 MPG right up until the day I traded it in at 108,000 miles.   However, it has been very cold and snowy here and I have been using the heat/fan more than I normally would, so I am hoping my ave. MPG over a year will jump up quite a bit.  I am hoping I just don't have the 1 Sport AT FIT that likes to eat gas as much as it does people and cargo.",Exterior size: compact. Interior size: huge.

5,Great Car ,perseverance8 ,12/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have had my little fit for about three weeks now and am lovin it, it is a great little car for a small family, the comfort is very good as I am 6' 2"" and I fit quite comfortably, the power from the 1.5L VTEC is quite adiquite, and the maual shift is silky smooth, I would have liked to have seen more durable carpeting but the quailty is still superb (remember this is a Honda), the first time I filled up I calculated right at 37 MPG 50/50 city/hwy driving which im very happy about.  I think honda has put together a winning package that will put a smile on your face whenever you take it for a spin.   ",,More durable carpet & cruise control on base model
5,Very Happy So Far,Tigercat ,12/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I'm a tall guy (6'6"") who was looking for lots of leg and head room along with good fuel economy, and without spending lots of money. The Fit really fits! The legroom is  fine, and the headroom is amazing (over 2""). I've filled the tank twice now, and got over 37 MPG each time--excellent for a car that's not even broken in yet. Acceleration isn't bad for such a small engine, and I can climb most grades at 55 MPH without downshifting out of 5th.  All the useful options (cruise, power, side airbags) come standard on the Sport Fit. I like to drive my cars into the ground (10+yrs typ) so I don't miss the expensive-to-fix Lexus-type stuff at all. My impression is the Fit will go the distance.","I love how smooth the manual shifter is. Parking is a pleasure. It's no sports car, but the handling is so nimble and responsive I sometimes imagine I'm driving one. The 'magic seats' are easy to use and versatile. At the top of the list, though, is interior room and fuel economy.","The pedals could be a little further apart for us big-feet folk. The wiper only has one intermittent speed; a more variable setting would help in mist. Like most modern remote-entry security-enabled cars, the keyfob is way too fat. Leather wrapped shift knob.

4.75,Solid and fun,dyussen ,11/29/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,4,5,5,"I bought this car after tiring of reliability issues and gas cost with a Jetta 1.8T Wolfsburg; the flexibility in storage space came in handy my first week. I was sold on this car before I even drove it, but then was even more impressed with it. It is fun and peppy to drive despite not having a giant engine - can't beat the fuel economy short of spending double for a Prius, and it is solid design. Inside fuel cover area fills takes water during car wash, cheaped out on some little things (awful stock Dunlop tires), TPMS is a terrible requirement - makes winter wheels expensive!","Magic seats, fuel economy, dependability, looks, iPod input, fun to drive, amazing heater!","Passenger visor mirror, greater front seat adjustment, much better tires"

Driving home on the interstate, it hardly felt like I had to apply any pressure to the gas pedal.  This car wanted to go!  And it had no problems maintaining 70 mph going up a large, long hill!  Very zippy and fun to drive. The seat fits me perfectly and it's comfy!  I'm looking forward to the good gas mileage now that gas it topping $3.17 here.  The ride is quiet; there is no rattling of any car parts.  On the interior, everthing fits together perfectly.","Cute!

5,Worth the money,rkvl ,11/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We needed a utility vehicle, and the Fit is really great. The seats that fold up are great for transporting our dog while the seats that fold down really help in carrying larger loads. The fuel economy is great.  I drive only short distances to work and school, but it also does really well on the highway.  I haven't taken it above 65, however. Not sure what it would do at faster speeds. The style is also great. I got a black one, and people really say it is a sharp car.  I recommend the Fit highly.",Folding seats and fuel economy,The cover for the hatchback should be standard.

4.625,Great Car,adkmehrman ,11/08/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"I have had the car for about a month and simply love it. I test drove every other car in the class and the fit was by far the best car. I live in the mountains and commute over 100 miles a day to and from work on winding roads, and this is by far the most fun I have had driving to work. This car's handling rivals many sports cars. I was initially a little worried about the small engine but it seems to be fairly pepppy. The cars interior especially the magic seats are truely first rate. I put the back seats in tall mode and put a blancket down on the floor and it is a perfect place for my dog to ride. I have been averaging about 34 miles to the gallon with fairly aggresive driving. Love it.",Manual transmission is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of driving. Magic seats are truely amazing. My wife has a Toyota Matrix that looks much bigger from the outside but we both feal that the Fit has way more room in the interior.,I think it does need a sixth gear for highway driving where the engine is running at pretty high rpm's at 70-75 mph.

My wife and I looked at a Subaru wagon but were not impressed with the fuel economy. The Fit caught our eye so we took a look. It had all the room and features we needed. After a quick test drive, we were sold. It is very fun to drive and overall very appealing. The space and flexibility of the interior is truly amazing.  After waxing the Fit this weekend, my opinion continues to improve. The blackberry pearl paint is flawless. The materials quality, and finish is impressive, regardless of price.","Cute & funky styling, good feel of steering and shifter, overall combination of fun & practical.","Could be quieter on the highway, Rear visibility impaired by the back seat headrests, Wish it had a huge sunroof!"

I've haven't had as much fun driving a car since my first VW a long time ago.  My mileage is great -- between 36 and 38.  This is not interstate driving, but short commutes, some city, lots of rolling hills.   I'm concerned about the clearance since I live where there is a lot of snow and mud.  And I wish the seat had a height adjustment -- I use a small pillow.  My only other complaint is that the seat fabric and the carpet look and feel cheap.

4.875,Best decision yet!,Louis ,10/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"When I was shopping for my first new car, I think I drove every car in its class. I found little things wrong with every single one of them, except the Fit. I am used to driving the family van, but did not want to buy a van because of how big they are and how much fuel they consume. The Fit has all the good parts of a van with all the good parts of a car. Lots of cargo space for a car this size. Seeing it from the outside does not do it justice.

Both myself (63"" tall) & my husband (75"") can drive it comfortably. This is the only car where he has inches of head rooms. The seat fold-down ability give it the best trunk space I have ever seen for a small car. Also like the ability to fold down the front seat level with the rear passenger & completely stretch out on long trips.  Don't know yet about the mileage & reliability but Honda sells an extended warrenty that seems worth it.

4,Good Car Overall,Jack ,10/05/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"This is our second car.  We purchased it last week.  Here are initial thoughts.  As a second car intended for local driving, or as a city car, it is a good choice.  The car handles well in turns and grips the road.  The driver visibility is excellent, and the stylish interior appears to be of good quality (time will tell).    We live in Pennsylvania with some steep slopes; the automatic transmission shifts gears going up hills.  On occasion,  the engine winds.  Since it is a brand new car, I'm tentative about putting too much stress on the engine.   The gas mileage is very good but not exceptional.  One might expect more from such a light weight car.  ","The interior allows for maximum use of space.  The car also has a lot of head room; it seats four average size adults comfortably. People and things will ""fit.""  Visibility is great, and responsive steering make driving fun.  The price is good, and you get the assurance of  the Honda brand.","The car is light.  Our other car is a Toyota Corolla, which is great.  The Corolla is more solid.  On long highway trips, we prefer the Corolla.  There is no elbow rest between the driver and passenger seats; this takes getting used to (for me).   My wife loves the car.  I like it."
5,Surprise!  ,Bigmark ,09/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We went out looking for a used CR-V, something my son could drive.  Well after being disappointed in the used car pricing, I walked past the Fit, and asked how much.  Next thing I was driving it around the block, putting it through its paces.  Now my wife is driving my Pilot, my son is driving her CR-V, and I am driving the Fit.  I am a BIG guy, 350+, and this car is still roomy.  Quick to react, and it has more than ample power to go down the highway (at the speed limit).  It has none of the bells and whistles of the Pilot, but it is more fun to drive.  If you are looking around for a commuter, this is the car for you.   ","Great handling, quick when it needs to be, and it is as easy to park as my Goldwing.  If you are a Honda owner most of the controls are in the same spot  (you dont need to get use to where the windshield wiper controls are).  For a small car it is tight as a drum, and it even has A/C.  ","There is a learning curve on where the front of the car is as you cannot see the hood at all.  It could use another gear for freeway driving, but it still does not seem like a struggle even at 80 (oops, I was not paying attention to the speedo)."

The only major new feature is the government mandated tire pressure monitor system. Corrected from the 07 is the giant bar of rubber wiper blades that were notoriously loud in all but the heaviest of rains. They've been replaced with more standard looking blades. Windshield fit seems to be improved as well (the 07s have problems with rattle/whistling windshields that are corrected with some silicon sealer)  Overall a great fun car to drive, lots of room for stuff, and easy on the wallet both at the dealer and pump","Fun to drive.
