I wish I would've gotten the 4-door hatch (GTI) for more usable space, although the trunk is large for a compact car.Pros: power, handling, safety, mileage, and insurance costs.  Cons: harsh ride, premium fuel, electrical and misc problemsThe car has been pretty reliable, I've never been stranded.  However, there are electrical problems such as the power door locks malfunctioning and false rear light burn out warnings.  I did have a fuel pressure sensor switch and PCV valve replaced under warranty.  The car require premium fuel and synthetic oil.  This car consumes half quart of oil every 2-3k miles.This car is direct injection so it has dirty intake valve deposit problems (a warning light came on at around 70k for an expensive cleaning I opted not to do).  The ignition coils seem to go bad every 60k miles causing cylinder misfire error codes.  Thermostat and air conditioning broke around 100k.Some good things are that the brake pads and clutch last forever, I've yet to replace the clutch, and only just replaced the rear brake pads at 150k miles.  The front pads were replaced around 75k.   This was my first VW and I did love it at first, but will be my last European car.  They look and drive great but have many little issues that add up to frustration over time.",,

This is my 2nd review on the car, the original being back in 12/2007. My overall stance on the car has not changed in the few years and 60,000 miles that have passed. My car still consumes very little to no oil within the 5k mile oil change intervals and has not had a mechanical break down. Some of the parts on the car have needed to be changed however (trunk gas struts, valve cover gasket & electronic door lock module).If you're looking at one second hand, check for oil leaks or slower performance/lower gas mileage (carbon buildup issue).Still 30ish MPG, still a sweet ride.","2.0T FSI

","Expensive to maintain (synthetic oil, low profile tires cost adds up), VW reliability is still being proven, further differentiation between Jetta and GLI trims.

(A word about it being expensive to maintain, the newer domestics from Ford & GM are requiring synthetic oil and fitting their cars with low-pro's too... so I guess they'll cost just as much to maintain)"

The color of the gauges at night are super cool. I like the ease of controls from the steering wheel instead of having to fiddle with the main controls.  One thing that has bothered me is 8 months ago from July 1st 2009, is that it started having problems. Tonight while coming from work the display said stop engine, oil pressure etc. For an 08 GLI w/ 30K thats awful. Make sure you check you oil people. I drive only 5K per oil change as told to and Somehow I'm on the minimum part of dipstick!! ",,Improve the wiring in the car. Do extended amounts of testing.

This engine has the timing chain, rather than a belt, and a few other upgrades to the engine.This car is safe, powerful, handles well, comfortable, looks good, luxurious enough, and has a huge trunk. My family member used to own a 3 series BMW and this car is just is good for about $15,000 less. If you want to be the person who says ""look at me""! and overpay just for a nameplate, get a BMW.

Nothing comes close for the money and the gas mileage is insane in relationship to power.

I like how the car just with the tap of the throttle likes to take off. It has great handling, very little under/over steer. The ESP option is great for dirt and gravel roads, helps with sticking to the road.  Since New Years Eve of 2008 I have put al ot of miles on the car. It has held up with no problem and does extremely well on the highway. Gas mileage isn't what I'm used to from my last car I owned. Yet the car gets compliments often and will be with me for a long time.","My favorite features would be the ESP control button. When winter comes around, turn it off and let the car loose in a parking lot. The 4 wheel disc brakes work wonders for though that like the track. I do like the DRL lights, they seem to provide a little more safety to the car.  ",The only thing I would suggest would be a little more aggressive style with autobahn packages available or a VR6 engine option. If they brought back the VR6 engine I'd buy a couple more.

I drive with a very heavy foot and still average 23-25 MPG (premium 93 gasoline). I'm 6'5"" and weigh 220 lbs, yet I have plenty of leg room. The adjustable seat height is probably one of my favorite features. My wife enjoys the feel of an SUV so she raises the seat all the way up when she drives and says it gives her a feeling of being higher up than a typical sedan. The steering is extremely responsive even under heavy acceleration. If you are unfamiliar with turbo's, there is a bit of lag noticeable when letting off the brake from a complete stop. It's a normal function of any turbo and just takes some getting used to. Love the car!

I was comparing the Subaru WRX and the GLI for quite a while. The only advantage of the WRX is the AWD. Everything else is better in the GLI. The biggest difference is the interior - the WRX looks like a ToysRus car inside. Plus GLI has wider rubber and much nicer rims, cleaner and nicer exterior look and I also got a decent deal on it. I like driving it hard on curvy roads - it has lots of grip and I am having a blast.

I really wanted a GTI, but the dealer didn't have any, and the test drive of the GLI sold me.  The engine is perfect for this car, and the gas mileage is surprisingly good considering the power the engine has (26-27 mpg for the first 1000 miles). The steering and handling feel tight, and the ride is very well controlled.   Coming from a Honda, the VW's interior is worlds superior in terms of amenities and build quality.  The interior lighting, interlagos cloth seats, HID headlights, red break calipers, 8-way adjustable seats and their comfort and details that really set this car apart.

I was leaning towards an Audi A4 with an S Package but decided to check out the vdubs too. It's a true German car with all it's high quality materials and engineering. The frame is solid steel and when you open and close the door you can feel its a well built car and not a Japanese thin framed vehicle.  The GLI comes with a turbo engine, a DSG dual clutch transmission that can shift faster than any human.  The sport's suspension and the Pirelli tires make the GLI handle nicely.

The fit and finish are outstanding.  The stereo and displays are loud and clear.  I had to travel to get my car and the 350 mile drive home was heaven and I even got 29 miles per gallon to boot!

In my mind it isn't as sporty as some people think it is or handles as well.  A vehicle that compares well to BMW that is not an Audi or Mercedes, is the 08 Mini Cooper S AM.

I owned an 04 BMW 330i with lim. ed. perform package, this is essentially what this VW offers, and a far greater value.
