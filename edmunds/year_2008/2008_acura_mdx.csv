They will not stand by their design or workmanship.  On new mdx's they added a plastic strip and plastic flare guard on door. So they know the design was bad but will not fix the problem.

Before my MDX I was averaging a new car every year.  Two Infiniti SUVs and one Escalade later I bought this.  I LOVE IT!  It has all the luxuries for a fair price with a beautiful fit and finish.  It's definitely a keeper!  It's comfortable, fun, safe, and easy to drive.   I put a lot of miles on my cars and this one has been the best of them all.  No problems whatsoever.  Before buying my MDX I test drove every Luxury SUV on the market.

The wipers turn on and off by themselves and also the engine oil sensor. It was awesome how the engine oil sensor bugged out and I was on the highway during rush hour. The last row seats are a nice add but not for long trips. Honda/Acura is notorious for their window problem on the driver side. Driving the MDX is fun the handling is awesome I can whip turns better then a lot of sedans. Even the Lexus cant beat it not sure about the X5.,"the handling also love the stock tires that come with the mdx got up to 65k body style is very nice, and the tailgate camera is so handy","FIX the sensors.

By the time I had equipped comparable vehicles (BMW, Lexus, actually), there was no comparison in price.  Don't get me wrong, BMW and Lexus were fantastic, but about $8K more when comparably equipped.   Leasing fit me...I drive 12,000/yr.

Also I love the technology package and I think that it has one of the best navigation systems. I have driven the car for near 15 months and 18000 miles and I've never had any problem with it.

Bold exterior style & big interior compared to other vehicles (RX330, FX35) was a big reason for buying.  We went with the Entertainment system as it was the only way to get the power tailgate at the time, but it's been great for entertaining the baby on trips. The car has been perfect EXCEPT for a constant, infuriating rattle around passenger door area (even at low speed) that shouldn't exist on a $40k car (dealer couldn't fix). Overall, love it, but it's really a 2nd tier luxury SUV.","Exterior styling, comfortable interior, navigation system, XM radio.","Acura really needs to improve ""fit and finish"" on the vehicle.

I have owned this car for three months. It works great with no problems at all. Just enjoy the fun when drive it. This is my first Acura, some of my opinions are: Gas mileage is quite low (13 mpg) in local roads. When slowing down speed, transmission gear shift is noticeable. Comparing to X5 3.0 (my other car) acceleration and handling is inferior even MDX has more powerful engine.

Good power, great ride, it has a sporty suspension that can take jumping a curb or ramming through uneven pavement going 60 mph. So that's a plus.  The interior is nice, good heated seats useful, excellent rear view camera.  One problem: the gear shift, wiper controls and light controls are less than easy to use.  First the wiper and light controls should be lit at night: they are not.  The biggest issue I have with them is that they lack the European feedback that BMW offers, i.e., I like to not have to look down to see what gear I'm in, what level wiper I am on, or what light is on.

This handles like a sports car, when in sport mode.  There is no wind or road noise. No rattles.  OK fuel economy, considering it's an suv. SH-AWD is truly amazing combined with Dynamic Ride Control in sport mode.  My other car is an 04TL 6MT/nav - no issues, love the car. Looked at Audi Q7 before MDX and I liked it, but MDX felt better during test drive, and handling is better on MDX. Acceleration seems smoother with MDX, and feels more powerful at any speed.

There are a few rattles including a loud one from the passenger seat.  The radio settings malfunction sporadically. The A/C makes whistling noises that sound like brakes squealing.  The dealer finally acknowledged some of the problems but they never adequately addressed all the problems either.  These are minor problems but a disappointment because I had a higher expectation of reliability.  I still love all the positives about the MDX.  I plan on keeping it for a while but I don't know if I will buy an Acura again?,I still love the comfort and handling balance. The seats and driving position are outstanding. This vehicle is easy and enjoyable to drive.  The headlights are fantastic too.  I am pleased with my mileage. It was worse when I first had it but I average 19.5 which is quite good for an SUV this size.,The quality needs to be improved.  It should not be a battle to get problems addressed.

That was a relief as I was fearful it might be even worse. The more we drove it, the more we liked it. Great combination of fun, comfort, and utility. Better visibility than originally thought. Never met a hill we couldn't keep accelerating up. I am almost 6'2"", my husband is 6'3"", we both have plenty of room up front and in the rear outboard seats, but the center second row seat is not for full- sized adults.

However, I was surprised when I had problems with the brake rotors at a low mileage and Acura told me that I ""brake too hard"" and I would ""burn"" the rotors because of my driving style. Well, I am a rather slow driver and 70 % of my driving is highway driving. I have had 4 Toyota SUVs prior to this one and never had a brake issue. Could there be a quality issue with the rotors on the 2008 MDX?

The handling, the transmission, the power, the comfort, the styling, just about everything!  I wish the gas mileage was better but I am lead-footed and I am averaging 17 mpg.  When I drive mostly highway, I get closer to 22.  We recently bought a second car, an '02 Maxima, and I couldn't wait to get back into the Acura. I forever will be an Acura fan!

I looked at BMW X5, Volvo XC90, Mercedes ML, Audi Q7, even Chevy Tahoe LTZ and concluded that the Acura was the best choice for the money.  Hondas/Acuras are legendary for thier reliability and resale value.  All things considered Acura is #1. Overall the MDX is a fabulous vehicle.","Favorite features include handling/performance, luxurious interior, cargo space, high safety ratings (feature very significant when choosing family vehicle), options available at reasonable price considering the competition, premium  audio system-10 speaker, over 400 watts surround sound-amazing sound","Push start button (keyless option) would be nice, add folding side view mirrors, iPod integration kit in dash should be standard for a vehicle of this caliber, smart cruise control, not as quiet of a ride as I thought it would be; but not bad."

Added chrome side steps, body molding and luggage rack.  Black on black combination turns alot of heads.  Acura doing great financing and going way low on pricing.

Fuel economy is not great - I get around 23 MPG on the highway at 73 MPH with cruise set, but around 17 in town.

So you think you are getting high quality for the money? Wrong! I have had problems since the beginning. There was extreme wind noise which they attributed to a bent windshield. The car started making clicking and grinding noises. That was the defective bushings. I have driven it exactly 16 days and the bushings have evidently gone bad again (bulletin on these).

I've always liked the MDX since 2001, and with the dealer incentive, it made it easier to justify the price jump. The MDX drives very smoothly with ample power. Handling and comfort is very nice for a vehicle this size. The interior is nicer than the competitors although the GT CX-9 is pretty good, too.

It is no longer than our ML, but it is wider. Acceleration kind of sluggish, mileage so far not as good as my MLs.

It is as fun to drive as something this size can be.  Great power to weight ratio once you are rolling.  Great highway cruiser, effortless and it does not wear you out in transit.  We have not gotten to really use the 4WD yet.  We have had it for 7 months.  ","Very stable and quiet at high speed. Very comfortable seats for four.  Audio controls on the steering wheel are nice.  The back up camera is important -- I don't know how you could do without this -- either a factory unit or an after market unit, as view out the back is poor. ","Another cog in the transmission would not hurt, but this vehicle does not have a truck engine and seems to love to rev.  SH AWD takes a little adjustment for high speed lane changes as they are very easy -- once you adjust this is actually a nice plus, but the first few times I had to correct back."
3.75,A fun SUV with a few bugs,G ,06/01/2008,,,4,4,5,2,,4,4,3,4,"Bought this car after comparing with the Q7 and X3.  Very happy with the engine and chassis, not so with transmission.  Fav part is the electronic damping control - when it works.  The system went down a few times with scary warning sign on gauge - and car rides like a boat when EDC is down.  Dealership tried but was not able to fix it properly.  Will try again.","Nav, EDC","More reliable EDC, better MPG"
3.875,Disappointed,richard mcmullen ,05/28/2008,,,3,5,4,5,,4,4,3,3,"I have owned 3 Hondas and 2 Acuras before. I had an 05 MDX and a 02 TL-S. I am very disappointed in the rigid ride of this vehicle. I have the base model. My 05 was softer and a more comfortable ride. I feel every bump in the road. I am suprised that Acura would not leave the base model as a more comfortable ride and give the stiffer ride to the sport package. There is a soft thump thump when I first start the car and reach 20 mph. I don't know if it is transmission, engine or suspension knock. There is a rattle on the pass door somewhere. The shifter is on the left of the center console and gets in the way of my right knee/leg. Info center is too small and in wrong place. No compass.","XM radio. Moonroof. Other than the intial knock, the trans shifts well. Engine is flawless. Functionality of all the features work perfect. Heated seats. Blue tooth. Memory features. Exterior looks sharp. IPhone plays thru the radio speakers. Side mirrors adjust down when backing up.",Softer ride. Larger side view mirrors. Info center should be where the clock/time of day is. Move shifter back to center of console and give more room for side to side legs. Power outlet under radio is hard to access in and out with flip cover. Seeing instant MPG. Better gas mileage. Running boards.
4.25,Super Handling AWD,JP ,05/27/2008,,,5,4,4,5,,4,5,3,4,"One of the best handling vehicles I've ever owned.  Feels much more like a sedan than an SUV (once it gets rolling).  Averaging about 20 MPG, feels like less since the tank is relatively small.   Stereo is very good. Oil changes are expensive since it requires synthetic oil. ",Feels like you're going much slower than you actually are.  Engine is loafing at 80 mph.,"Automatic door locks should engage faster.  Climate control is mediocre, find myself fiddling with it a lot. "
4.75,Great CUV overall,josephd05 ,05/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I am 6'4"" and find the seating comfort to be superb.  The Sport suspension is fantastic.  In comfort mode, it soaks up all the bumps.  In Sport mode, I feel like I'm driving a sports sedan.  This is a fantastic vehicle, but not without faults. 1. AM radio sounds terrible, very muffled. 2. Telescopic steering wheel should extend out a couple of more inches. 3. Bluetooth is okay, but does not automatically activate if I make the call from my blackberry.  You have to make the call from the car itself, very annoying. Thats about it.  Overall I am very pleased.",Active suspension. Nav. Seating comfort. 3 zone climate control.

4.875,Outstanding Value,Bradley ,05/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I researched and test drove everything else in this style of vehicle (Acadia, Buick, Nissan, Mazda, Honda).  For the money, this is the best by far.  The ride is excellent, the nav is great and the graphics are much better than GM.  I love the cockpit feel of the cabin and the comfort of the seating.  The exterior got my attention and the interior keeps it.  I have three children ages 10, 8 and 8 and we are in a carpool with two other kids for a total of 6 people in the vehicle.  We can easily fit one more.  We have 16.6 MPG with mixed driving (mostly driving in the local neighborhoods).  Got over 23 MPG when on the highway for a short period of time.  We look for reasons to drive places!","Customized seating and controls per driver, great navigation system, bluetooth is great, entertainment system is great with very intelligent controls from the front or from the remote control in the rear.  Takes corners and bumps VERY well.  Love the fact that not many people have them where I live.","Can't believe that it doesn't have RDS (radio system that shows name of song, etc.), would love to have a slightly smaller engine with better fuel economy.  A la carte items such as running boards, body molding, rear sensors and roof rails would be great to have standard."
4.75,Great SUV,Bert Viloria ,05/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I just bought my 2008 MDX a couple of weeks ago and I have been thoroughly impressed with its superb handling, amazing interior with all its electronic gadgetry, and beautiful exterior, which has not always pleased everyone.  The ride is smooth, aggressive, but not dull and lifeless.  The standard electronics available, even for my basic MDX is a long list and should easily please everyone!","Interior electronics, aggressive front and stylish side and back exterior, soft leather seats, superb AWD handling",Gas mileage

It performs well, nice acceleration, handles well and it looks good.  My biggest issue is gas performance. I'm getting 13 mpg in the city. It's not much better than an H1 or a Winnebago. I didn't buy the car for it's fuel economy but this is far below what I expected. I should get more than 250 miles out of tank of gas.","Love the navigation, XM and general feel of the car.","Fix the delay on the backup camera. Most importantly, improve the MPG."
4.875,Can't believe it's 4600 lbs.,gtfranklin ,05/09/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My previous 4 cars were 3 BMWs and a G35, and I finally found a crossover that didn't disappoint in the handling dept. This is actually fun to drive! My G35 and previous M3 were quicker, but didn't handle significantly better in most driving situations. Solid, comfortable, tons of space, and WAY less expensive that comp. X-5, Audi, etc. Mileage 19.4 in 1st 2000 miles.","Quality, features, handling. Nice engine sound above 4000 rpm. Great resale history.",Had to switch from Motorola to Sony to get full utilization of HF link. Could use 6th gear in AT... big ratio jump between 4th & 5th.
5,Excellent value by comparison,Billboy ,05/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We traded our 2005 BMW X5 for this 2008 Acura MDX.  The BMW was good, but the Acura is surprisingly better in many ways.  Actually handles better, has a quieter ride and more power than the BMW.  The interior is well-designed and matches up with our previous best in class, an Audi we owned a few years ago.  The cost of ownership will be only slightly higher ($39 for an oil change where the BMW was covered while under warranty), but the eventual cost should be lower.  The styling is what really caught my eye.  More muscular stance and presence, but more interior space.",The all-wheel drive ability to transfer power side-to-side instead of just forward-to-rear; build quality; overall ride; styling; comfort; convenience features.,"Body side moldings, roof rack and cargo cover need to be standard features - not options."
5,Acura MDX = Amazing Sport SUV,CLEW ,05/05/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We just purchased an 08 MDX with Tech and Entertainment with the power rear door.  I drove X5 (3.0 and 4.8), Caddy SRX, and Mazda CX9 and hands down the Acura was the choice to make.  It handles like (or better really) than the BMW with so many more options for the price.  If you want a great, luxury SUV and want the best quality and value go with the MDX.  The handling is so impressive, and the power from the 3.7 litre V6 will shock you.  Navi is so easy to use and the whole sound system is unreal!","Powerful engine, sweet exhaust note, AWD, DVD entertainment system, navi, basically everything.  One really cool feature you should note is you can open and close the rear door either automatically or with the buttons - that is a really nice touch if you want to close/open the door more quickly.","Acura should just include the roof rack, side moldings, and step rails standard."
4.875,Right Choice,Albert ,05/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Test drove Lexus RX 350, Volvo XC90, Pilot, and 2009 Murano before selecting the MDX. It's the best in class.  Great SUV. It runs much better after the initial 500 miles or so. GPM got better too.  Some of the accessories should have been made standard (roof rail, side molding). The plastic door handle and the same color plastic on the steering wheel make the interior look cheap. Acura should have made them better and add a few hundred dollars to the based. This is sold by Honda/Acura as a luxury SUV. ","Nav, bluetooth, quite but great highway performance. DVD-A quality audio.",1. The plastic on door handle (inside) and steering wheel look cheap. 2.

Choice was between an 08 Highlander and 08 MDX and for a few thousand more you get a much more impressive interior, better handling & steering feedback, a more agile ride, and HID headlamps.  Fuel economy has been much more impressive than expected - ~24 highway, ~19 city, 22 avg with 65/35 highway/city driving (1,300 mi on odo).  Only major gripes are you can't read the stereo display screen with sun glare from sunroof (even on max brightness) & no compass is present.","Auto-open windows/sunroof, bluetooth, comfortable seats, quiet ride & handling, extremely bright headlights, multiple power outlets.",Include standard options present only on Canadian base model (compass & headlamp washers).

In my opinion it had significatnly less body roll then even the others. The ride is very confidence-inspiring in rain, sun and snow. The sound system is absolutely incredible. Furthermore, I for one also really like the knob instead of touchscreen navigation. I find that the engine power is good from a standstill, but could use more power for passing. Certain speeds dont allow you to shift down to reach high revs required for optimal torque. As such sometimes you dont get sufficient acceleration. i also really like the styling.

5,Love this car!,tammyd ,04/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this car.  I owned an MDX before purchasing the 2008 with the new body style and roomier interior.  I opted for the loaded version.  I think the joystick navigation is wonderful and so much easier to use.  I also love the new body style.  The inside is roomier than the older version.  With trying to stay in the midsize SUV and having a 3rd row seat, this can't be beat.  The 3rd row folds down flat for lots of cargo space when not using the 3rd row.  Also, with the position of the handles now being in the middle instead of the top of the seats, it is much easier to pull the seats up when using the 3rd row.  One simple tug and ""presto"" - extra seating.  Great buy!  You'll love it!","3rd row back seat, joystick navigation, body style, roomier interior, super comfortable seats, telescoping steering wheel, much better voice recognition with the hands free phone system - just talk softly when setting up",Better quality wood in interior.

Handles firm but comfortable on the highway.  Havent had a chance to check it out in the snow but looking forward to it.  Gas mileage could be better but its got 300 horses, cant have everything.  Nav system is a big plus.  Easy to use and comes with bluetooth and a very good sound system in the package.  ","Handling!  Comfortable cabin for a tall guy.  Service costs dont empty our pockets.

Looked at another JGC and found out that mine was superior to the current JGCs.  I shopped BMW, Infiniti, Lexjus, BMW X5.  MDX is easiest and most comfortable car or SUV I have ever owned, very quiet and smooth.  Navi took practice, but now is easy to operate.  I won't own another car that doesn't have it.  AWD is like you're on rails.  Stereo is second to none & iPod adapter is simple.  I don't use XM or real-time traffic, but I would b/c they were great during the free trial period.","Engine - feels quicker than competitor V-8s.  Gas mileage - 21 hwy/18 city.  AWD - I don't really ""off-road"" but MDX is perfect for light-duty (hunting with dirt roads and ski trips) adequate clearance, no fear of getting stuck. Tech package is a  must. Great storage, smooth ride.  TROUBLE FREE!!!","If I were really picky, I would suggest a turbo option.  I test drove an RDX and it was unbelievable for a 4 cyl.  Not to that MDX V-6 is weak, it is better than competitor's V-8s with great gas mileage, too.  Regular gas would be nice... premium is too expensive. Fancier exterior would be nice."

The price of the MDX compared to what it offers is a ""no brainer.""  It drives like a combination of my old Pilot and an S2000 I use to have. I often forget it is an SUV. The build quality is spectacular; first new car I have had that has no rattles or defects. ","The features for the price, the styling (especially that distinctive grille), and the sports car driveability. I especially love those plush, comfortable seats.","There are no courtesy lights on the doors (even my Pilot had those), so I would recommend more perimeter lighting.  It also is a bit slower than my old Pilot, probably because of the weight. And yes, it is one thirsty SUV, but better than most others. Also a complicated voice-activation system."

The fuel economy is the only real drawback that we can say at this point in time about the vehicle.  You really should test drive this vehicle if you are considering anything in this class.  Much more responsive than the Lexus and a lot more room.  Looks like Acura did a great job of redesigning the whole vehicle.  This is a true pleasure to be behind the wheel.  Acceleration is very smooth, shifting is as well.  Braking and handling is next to none.","Drivability period!! Very fun and responsive to drive.  Great stereo and navigation system.

This is a vehicle which can complete with the top SUVs on the market and retain its value.  Third seat is not for adults.

Best cross over suv on the market.","nav system, AWD, and its great looks.","Fuel economy, and push button for the back door.  "
4.875,Great Car!,Mike ,11/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just purchased a new 2008 Acura MDX.  We have 2 kids and were looking for an SUV with a 3rd row of seats.  Test drove the X5, Buick Enclave and Mazda, Lexus, Volvo and Chevy. This car was by far more superior for the room, price and comfort.","Interior comfort, smooth ride. It's a solid car!   ",More cargo space when utilizing the 3rd row of seats.   Better gas mileage.
4.875,Outstanding vehicle,gaawb ,11/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"For the money, this is the finest vehicle on the road.  The nav system is unequaled and incredibly impressive.  I test drove the X5, FX45, MKX, Q7, and Enclave. It was a tough decision between the X5 and MDX but I will never look back. I've driven 2000 miles and it is an absolute pleasure in every way.  The 300hp engine actually puts a smile on my face when I punch it.  If you are looking for a crossover, this is a no-brainer.","Nav; SH-AWD; stereo system is fantastic; DVD system allows backseaters, with headphones, to listen to XM, radio, CD on different channel than front seat people; power, especially low-end torque; voice-activated bluetooth, climate control, and nav (incredible). ","Wish it had push-button start and remote start.  Once you've had those (Infiniti), it's hard to ever use a key again.  Other than that, this vehicle is absolutely tremendous. "
5,Exceeds Expectations,pdx family ,11/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We have had the 2008 Acura MDX for a month now and couldn't be more delighted.  It is replacing a Chrysler T&C.  My ratings are based on what my expectations are in this class of vehicle.  The size is perfect for us, it seats 5 easily and the +2 rear seating is quite acceptable though the access is difficult.  The ride is comfortable, firm and responsive. Sport upgrade is worth it. The navigation system is outstanding and can be operated while moving.  You must read the manuals to understand all the features. The gas mileage we have gotten is significantly better than EPA ratings. We got 25 mpg on a 200 mile x-mountain trip and see about 19 mpg in mixed town driving. ","Excellent ability to customize preferences, such as when the doors automatically unlock. Great gas mileage (for an SUV, its not a Prius). Very comfortable. Handling .Navigation computes route very quickly. I don't have to find my cell phone to answer my phone (bluetooth finds it buried in my purse).",Wish the heated seats would turn off when the car is turned off.  Often passenger seat is left on with no passenger. Wish you could lock all the doors with the remote while a door remains open. Wish I could add comments or favorites to POI.
4.875,Outstanding SUV !,Tchello ,11/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After thorough research that included major brands (BMW, MB, Volvo & Audi) the MDX came on top. The standard model comes with leather, moonroof and 3rd row seat. Got the Sport package with technology and it's a bargain compared with the other, more fancy, brands. At least $10K less for a very similar, and in many cases, superior product. If you don't need the status of a BMW or Mercedes, this is the way to go. I traded my Audi A4, and I'm very happy I did so. Overall, very solid and handles great. Smooth.","Navigation is awesome and couldn't be easier to use. Very intuitive. Rear camera is nice, not very useful though. Huge room when 3rd row seat isn't beind used.","C'mon Acura! Roof rack + door molds must be standard! It's an SUV, isn't it? Running boards for over $700 ? Are you kidding?? Still, love the car. ;-)"
3.875,Mildly Disappointed,Randall Hazzard ,11/13/2007,,,4,4,3,2,,5,5,3,5,"Performance and fun to drive. Love to hear it rev. My gas mileage is poor at 16.2 MPG. That is a mix of 60% highway and 40% city. Reliability and quality is less then expected. Slow leak in tire that dealer wanted to charge me $380.00 dollars to replace because they cant find the link but acknowledge the leak is there.  Needed to jump start 3 times. Twice because little dome light was left on by kids. Once because of a draw off battery that has been difficult to trace.  Mirrors don't adjust with change of driver in preprogram settings. Dealer says this is normal but if you can change my XM stations with different drivers, you can certainly adjust mirrors.","Handling, style, comfort, good room and comfort in back seats. DVD player with head phones for happy kids on a long haul.",Timers on all lights and accessories to help prevent dead batteries. Better quality tires. Ability to adjust sensitivity of voice recognition commands. Better dealer service 
5,Acura is Awesome!,Mr. Wang ,10/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just purchased my new 2008 Acura MDX Sport and I love it. My trade was a 2004 Acura TL. The MDX is very quick, has great handling, smooth ride, and the fit and finish is excellent. The interior design is very intuitive and the navigation system is easy to use. There is plenty of passenger and storage room. I love the exterior design. Must have accessories are the sport running boards, side body molding, roof rails/cross bars, and the front and rear silver garnish. This is definitely a high performance SUV with lots of luxury!","Engine is smooth and powerful. Fit and finish is excellent. Lots of interior room. Aggressive exterior design, especially with exterior accessories. Navigation system is the best. ELS audio system is powerful and crystal clear.",
4.875,Great Value,Lee ,10/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I have always driven BMWs and the last car was the GX 470 Lexus.  The new 2008 Acura is an excellent value for the money.  It is about 12K less than the X5 for the same amenities.  Very happy with the purchase.  I have not had it serviced yet so cannot give an opinion on that yet.,"Interior comfort, navigation, chrome wheels.  Like the 2007/2008 Acura exterior. ","Larger side view mirrors and automatic fold in, mirror with a compass, wood grain steering wheel should be included with the sport package."
4.75,A great car,the man ,10/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,This car is so smooth. I also have a pilot and this car rides and handles much better. Has a real luxury feel to it.,Dashboard and dual power seats.,None so far.
4.25,Satisfied,RV ,10/08/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,3,4,"Hello, Have had this car for three weeks, bought the tech/entertainment package (blk/blk). Car is beautiful inside and out. Navigation is easy to use, if you've had navigation before.  HandsFree Link with our blue tooth phones is awesome.  Car accelerates and handles excellently.  We own an integra before this so we knew it was going to be a quality vehicle and are not disappointed.  10 speaker stereo is amazing. Kids can listen/watch DVDs in back while we listen to radio in front.  Can't complaining about gas mileage, car is full sized SUV not a Honda civic!! Our MDX gets same gas mileage as our Pathfinder, if you want excellent gas mileage buy something smaller. Awesome car!!","HandsFree Link, backup camera, voice activated navigation.",Would be nice if body side molding was standard and not an option!
4.5,2008 MDX-Tech,V V ,10/03/2007,,,4,4,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I just bought this about a month now. Driving is so fun, comfortable, easy to use the navigation. At night the interior looks just like a cockpit (I heard this word from my friends who saw my SUV). Most of the essential features are standard, so there are no additional expenses for a luxury SUV. The handling of this SUV is very nice, any sharp turn, neither passinger nor driver feels much body sway as like other car or SUVs. I rate this SUV 8-9/10 for most of the features.","Handling is smooth. Reverse camera. Navigator is easy to use. Reverse light is great, wide front light.","Running board should be a standard feature, petite people have difficulty climbing in the seat. Navigator clarity is not that great, rear view mirror is too small, doesn't give enough details around you, no luggage carrying capacity after using 3rd row seat, the old model was better for this."
4.75,Excellent SUV ,fort99 ,10/01/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,We bought ours a week ago. So far so good. Excellent handling especially compared to 4Runner. It would be perfect with less tire noise. ,Excellent handling SH-AWD.,Reduce tire noise. 
2.875,Luxury?,Wanna be luxury ,10/01/2007,,,3,1,3,3,,4,3,3,3,"This vechicle is adequate and has a smooth ride. However, the interior has too much plastic and is uncomfortable for a ""luxury"" SUV.  I feel I was pressured into buying the MDX and would caution others to look at BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus before buying.  Even the Murano is competition and is 12k cheaper!  I feel like ripping out the corning looking dash.  The voice recognition is distracting and Acura should scrap it.  The steering wheel grip reminds me of my father's 1966 Chevy.  It is way too thin.  Also, the seats are way too firm.  I have to send them out for foam to be added.  The DVD player cost is a ripoff but it's the only way to get the automatic tailgate.",Smooth ride.,Exterior grill - it's ugly. Seats. Thicker steering wheel.
4.625,2008 MDX with Tech Package,Salil ,09/30/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Just purchased the 2008 MDX with Tech Package. It's a great solid SUV with AWD std. This SUV is very good compared to other luxury SUV (the lexus RX350 is too small inside, the BMW 5 series is too expensive, the Cadillac SRX is too much of a station wagon, and the Escalade is too big). We love the backup camera and the navigation, worth every penny. I would say Acura has done a wonderful job outside and inside, although there are some cost cutting methods implemented like the door handles. I really wish the tech package had the automatic trunk (hatch) release where is opens up completely. You have to buy the Ent. Pack to get that. Overall it's a great SUV at this price point.","Solid overall features, backup camera and nav.",Make auto trunk release standard. Door handles look cheap. Better gas mileage wanted. Allow this vehicle to run on unleaded or plus gas (premium should not be expected).
4.25,Great Handling Plus Super Navigation System,PBenjung ,09/23/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,3,4,"Bought last week and am enjoying the ride.  Excellent acceleration, transmission shifts very smoothly, handles great around corners.  Interior fit and finish is good.  Still figuring out nav system but its mostly intuitive and a great asset.  ",Bought for nav and am not disappointed.  ,Needs larger side mirrors.  Blind spots take getting used to.  Also could use larger cargo area as there is basically none if you keep the third row seats up.  Acura engineers need to design for regular gas as it only takes premium.
