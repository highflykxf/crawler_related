You are limited to one voice for directions, where others offer several voices. The nav system will override what you are trying to input most of the time and will prevent you from typing in the name of a street you are trying to navigate to. Simply put the nav system is junk.

Would not have considered buying an MB in this class 1 year ago, but now believe Audi and BMW have some serious ground to make up. To think that a VW Passat is easily more expensive, blows my mind. MB hit the bullseye on the price performance target, and when the market catches up I won't feel as special in by beautiful new ride. But who cares, I love going places just to drive it! ","Exterior styling, especially front grille and side body contours. Interior design is top shelf. Auto-detect bluetooth mobile phone feature rules. Rear-seat room blows the competition away, adults can actually ride in the back.","If MB put their blue tech diesel in this car, I doubt I'd ever drive anything else again, until the flying model was came out at least. The stock stereo is the red-headed stepchild of features in this car, and its pretty weak that you have to get the silly multi-media package to upgrade the sound."
3.75,No all it's cracked up to be,hectorsoy ,07/18/2008,,,3,5,4,4,,4,3,3,4,"I've driven this car for 3 months and am not impressed. The tiptronic shifts for itself when I rev towards redline. The interior seems cheap. The volume controls on the steering wheel should be on the left side instead of the right. The car seems crude compared to the Acura TSX and BMW 3 and Lexus IS. My other car is the TSX and the tiptronic shifts much better and much more responsive. And it won't upshift by itself!! It is also difficult to coax a downshift when at medium rpms, this is no problem on the Acura. The instruments are archaic and difficult to read when compared to the Japanese counterparts. People who are happy with this car must have driven Buicks beforehand. ",,
2.75,My first and last M-B,peanut ,07/05/2008,,,1,4,2,3,,3,3,3,3,"I am very disappointed with my first M-B. The wind noise at highway speeds is terrible, have to turn radio up 3-4 notches just to hear, dealer says nothing they can do. The placement of the cruise control lever is a joke, don't know how many times I end up signaling a right turn and not turning on the control. My bluetooth phone worked fine in my last car, but will not connect in the M-B. The navigation system got me the first time I needed it with the ""Prepare to turn right"". At the next street I turned and as I did it then says ""In 800 feet turn right onto bla bla street"". Wouldn't it have been just as easy to say ""In a quarter mile, right turn etc"". ",It's sad to say the best part of this car is the driver's seat is comfortable.,Too many to list.

After 4,000 miles, I have to say I love this vehicle. It brings a smile every time I sit in it.  And it still smells like brand new!","Styling! Best looking vehicle in the class. Build quality is exceptionally high. Also, handling, performance and fuel economy. Stereo system and the command center are very easy to use. Great fuel enconomy for the engine size (and my style of driving).",I wish Europeans would adopt some aspects of the American definition of luxury.

We've not been disappointed with the purchase. The ride, handling, and everything about it makes us wonder why we waited so long. It looks good on the outside and feels good on the inside. We selected the black/black. This combination looks really good, but it does dirty quickly. Oh, well, guess that's the price one has to pay to drive the car of one's dreams.  People think we paid a lot more than we did, it looks that good!  And an added bonus: we're getting plenty of extra exercise parking far away from other vehicles in parking lots!",We love the fact that the side mirrors turn in when locked and/or manually when desired.  Love the blue tooth and access to volume on the steering wheel. Also love the heated individual seats and temperature controls as we are never on the same page as far as body temperatures.,Now that gas is so high mwish it did get a bit better gas mileage. The interior of this car does show white smudges (dust?) very easily.  Wish there was a way to prevent the marks on the interior. (they do clean up easily though)  And wish they would make a ding-proof car door!

Many people comment on the lack of leather upolstery as standard, but my experience with the MB Tex has been much better durability and appearance after several years of use. I would recommend the P2 package. You will really appreciate the visibility afforded by the Bi-Xenon headlamps. Once you have purchased Mercedes no other vehicle will do.",P2 package and the 7 speed automatic ,Memory seat for the driver and a power tilt and telespcopic steering wheel.

The steering is lighter than expected, but it makes it very easy to drive. Very strong brakes, plenty of power, a nice exhaust note coming out the back, a firm yet comfortable ride, and excellent, well controlled cornering. It's very quiet as well. Also, the aggressive styling makes heads turn! I test drove a 328i, but the C300 is a much better value,smoother,and the styling is worlds ahead of the 3.","The aggressive styling, AMG bodywork, quiet, solid and well composed chassis, nice exhaust sound. Also, it comes standard with a Sunroof, Bluetooth, and power seats. I also love the optional iPod integration.","The temperature dials for the A/C feel a bit cheap, and sometimes the Bluetooth goes wacko and won't connect to my phone.

The Multimedia boasts a 7.1 surround sound system, DVD, navi, voice command, bluetooth connectivity, and a 6 disc cd changer.  It's always conversational piece with every passenger.

First of all it has a very clean look. The exterior has a good blend of sporty and luxurious. The interior is also very nice. A very clean and luxurious look. However I'm not too sure about the bucket seats. Though the leather is absolutely gorgeous, I feel the seats could have been more comfortable. There ok though, some people really like them. The best part is the engine. It has superpowers. ","Manual mode; fun to play around the 5000 rpms. Harmon kardon sound system is good. Leather is beautiful.  Navigation is easy to understand and cool to look at as you drive. The engine isnt a feature, but I can't stress how much I like the acceleration. ","I would improve the gas mileage. I understand It has a huge engine and it requires a lot of gas, but i wish it had a higher MPG. The bucket seats could have been more comfortable but if your used to bucket seats they'll be ok.

Found that the folding mirrors were a godsend in medieval towns where a few streets were unbelievably narrow.  The bellhops in every town loved the arctic white--most cars of that model in Europe were black, grey or silver--and I really like the Savannah/cashmere interior. Get the all weather mats though.

It also gets 30 MPG cruising over 80 mph! The styling is unbeatable, the car is drop dead gorgeous and the rims are so sporty I didn't even have to upgrade to the AMGs. However where this car falls short is performance. I test drove a Lexus IS350 and BMW 335i both had the same size engine, and same MPGs yet they were much quicker and more powerful.

This year I got the C300 sport because of how great it looked. Everything about the car is tremendous except the seats. They are possibly the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in - almost to the point that I can not drive the car. I am trying to resolve with the dealership and hope they will come through. Would hate to lose them as my number one brand.,Exterior look spectacular. Interior design stunning. Handles like a Mercedes.  ,Not as quiet as my old C320 - not as air tight. Speaker system weak - muddy. But most of all the seats have no cushioning and cause pain.

The car feels strong on the road and is very quiet! It holds the road very well. The 4matic transmission allows us on steep inclines on ice and snow covered Denver streets to go right around cars spinning their wheels. The sound system is great and to sit back and watch a movie, in 5.1 sound, while waiting for our daughter's soccer practice to end is like a home away from home.",Quiet ride. Easy maneuvering and tight steering.  Holds the road and is a nice heavy vehicle.,Different material for the dash. Memory position for the seat adjustments and mirrors.
4.375,It is OK,DC mercedes owner ,05/12/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,2,5,"After having driven Volvos for 30 years, I decided I needed a change so purchased a Mercedes C300 Luxury 4matic after test driving a number of cars. The car is easy to drive and very easy to park. It holds the road well. The seats could be a little softer. The visibility during the day is excellent. I purchased the Premium 1 package. The rain sensing wipers as part of the package only work well when it is raining hard- a time when the regular wipers would provide the same performance. The auto-dimming  rear view mirror blacks out almost completely when there is a car behind you- I find this extremely dangerous since one is not able to change lanes safely under the circumstances.      ","Easy to park, easy to drive, smooth ride, holds the road well, and good daytime visibility. The satellite radio and bluetooth interface for hands free cell phone use are fun. ","The auto-dimming rear view mirror and side mirror need major improvement, as well as the rain sensing wipers.  The gas mileage (13-14 mpg for city driving) is not great and should be improved.  Contrary to the Mercedes brochure and consumer reports, you cannot use Ethanol E85 with the 4Matic.   "

For all I was looking at '08 models. In my opinion, the Mercedes C300 offered the greatest driving performance and luxury experience along with the best value. Certainly the fun factor is greater in the BMW's, the Lexus is slightly quieter and the Saab most offordable. The C300 is, however, very fun to drive and the engineering allows you to push the 3.0L V6 to its limits. A very fun ride but with comfort for every day driving.",It's a Benz! The redesign is a great step up from previous models (ie - lack of American design influence is a huge plus). The options are reasonably priced comared to competition.,"I purchased the luxury model because I loved the interior. I did upgrade the grille to the sport model grille since the luxury model is a bit boring looking for such a small sporty car.

Over 15 years ago I had a 190 2.3 which had a better quality MB Tex material inside, but it felt like leather, In this car it is like rough sandpaper. Interior space is tight for me (6-3 ft). Storage compartments are small, the worst is its tiny glove compartment, not even the car manual fits in it and no sunglass compartment. I had an Acura Legend, a TL, a BMW 530 and last an Infinity FX35, all had by far better interior features and materials. I wish I hadn't traded in my FX!",Fold-down rear seats and panorama roof (option package II); excellent power and handling in curves etc.,"Better space utilization for storage.

The C350 no longer has that femine design (2007), the 2008 is masculine with a design women will enjoy as well.

I don't believe in the Asian luxury line of cars - Acura and Lexus, they are just expensive Hondas and Toyotas. Another reason to the buy a German car was that, I have driven MB and BMW ( parents and sibling owned).  This car is a very improved C-Class, The 2008 C class was introduced around the time I was looking to buy and hence I test drove the previous C classes ( all different models).

This car is turning heads everywhere i go, getting honks & thumbs up while driving on the highway. after driving a Crossover SUV i was extremely pleased to get 400 mls on a full tank.  I'm having a hard time leaving the car parked.  The plan was too drive my old vehicle as a daily driver & keep the Benz for special occassions.  This baby is too beautiful to leave sitting! ","Bluetooth, panoramic roof,AMG appearance package, satellite radio, aux connection in glove box. ","Put the seat controls on the door, I was hoping for that look, put a sensor on the passenger door too for remote window & sunroof opening."
4.75,2008 C300 AWD Luxury,jatnova ,10/04/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"Purchased the C300 a couple of weeks ago and so far really love it.  I traded a 2004 Accura TL for the C300 and I think MB is much better.  Quieter overall ride, just as much power (or at least enough power), better handling and a really nice interior.  Exterior with the new silver color looks really sharp. Car is built well and has a very solid feel. The handling on the road and quiet ride while driving is much better than the TL or previously owned Lexus. ","Handling, quiet cabin, tilt in mirrors.","Memory for driver side seat, bigger glove box."
5,Best sedan ever!,Homer ,10/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got this car six weeks ago, and it has been the best car I drive so far. I traded it in for a C-230 and theres a lot of difference between them. I got it black on black, and it looks clean, a lot of people had told me ""that car looks beautiful""  and I really think so.","Bluetooth, CD in-dash, front grille (sport one), stereo screen display","Better sound system, more powerful sound"

2.75,Decent Entry Level Car,CHEAPCAR ,09/29/2007,,,2,4,2,1,,3,4,4,2,"Not as luxurious at the Infiniti G, not as sporty as the BMW 3 series and not as reliable as the IS350. Purchased it because it was priced the best out of all 3. The other 3 cars had too much power and were too expensive. This car isn't on par with the other 3, but you get what you pay for. ",Good looking exterior. Decent drive. Comfortable seats. Good gas mileage. Very affordable!,"Even though it is an entry level sedan, there should be a lot less plastic. MB should not market this care as a luxury car. Its a C-Class, not an S- Class. MB needs to offer free servicing."
4.125,Good but not as fun as BMW or Infiniti,Scott ,09/22/2007,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I like the new C class design its gorgeous. Nice car but not as much fun as the BMW, Lexus IS 350, Audi A4 or Infiniti G37 coupe.  I was disappointed by the slow performance for a V6 with 268HP it felt very slow. Seats not that comfortable either. At least MB got the design right now they have to add more power and torque like BMW and Infiniti and Lexus. These all have over 300HP engines and are much quicker and more sporty than MB C350. But the MB has the best looks and styling so if you want looks and status the new C class is tough to beat. If you want sports luxury get a BMW, Lexus or Infiniti.","Exterior design, looks.",Needs more power and torque. Needs a manual transmission in  C350 and options for 20 inch AMG rims. Get a touch screen NAV like Lexus and Infiniti. 
5,What a ride,d of athens ,09/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I traded my 2005 Acura tl for this car 30 days ago and am very happy with it.

4.875,Good bye Lexus!,John ,09/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I bought an Artic White C350 with Light Grey and Black interior mid- August (premium II pkg and Pano-roof) Waited over a month but it was worth it! I got rid of my Lexus 2003 IS300 and am very pleased. It accelerates smoothly and quickly, I love the 7 speed transmission. The seats are extremely comfortable. It is so much quieter than my previous IS and even quieter than the new generation IS250/350. The ride is extremely smooth and I can not tell you how people have stopped me on the road and walking by to tell me how great this car looks! I have never owned a car that recieves so much attention!","Panoramic roof (have to get it!), Power fold in side mirrors, Bi-Xenon headlamps, cornering foglamps (very cool), fold down rear seats (no Lexus sedan has those!) handsfree bluetooth, AMG wheels and AMG front, rear, side body kit","I have averaged 15 MPG but i only do stop and go city driving.

5,Fantastic & Elegant,Denver ,09/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We just purchased a 2008. The vehicle is beautiful. The power is more than adaquate. With all of the safety options and driving control/traction we can't wait to use it in the snow as we travel in the Denver/Boulder area. This car will be our last ""big purchase"" for us for a long time. It has all of the features Can't lose with a Benz, however you also can't get a true ""Benz"" without adding the options and plan on spending over $45,000 when you are all done.","Everything exterior, quiet cabin and ride, grille and front end","Tinted window should be standard, plastic product dash, memory of seat settings is needed"
5,Great Car,Bill  ,09/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I both wanted the C300 Luxury Sedan.  We have had it a week and took it on the road this past week- end and love the ride, average 28.1 MPG, love the looks inside and out. We plan on keeping the car for a long time.

4.75,Big step up for C-class,lfbmdpc ,09/11/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"Really lovely car. Very BMW like (taught suspension, excellent  powerplant, good road view and road feel). Got the MB tex interior which feels a little cheap, but all told car is quite luxurious in a Germanic kind of way. While competition for this car is supposed to be the BMW 335i, I really think the better comparison is with the recent BMW E90 330i sedan with sport pkg. . Both cars are not speed demons, but are very entertaining as a daily driver and when the spirit moves you to carve up some road. As a middle aged man, I appreciate the ease of getting in/out of this vehicle and it's civilized demeanor around town. This car is now a viable alternative to the BMW 3 series.","Taught suspension, no-nonense teutonic cabin, very intuitive computer interface, bluetooth, very responsive engine and transmission, back seat actually fits two adults.","Needs a stick option, better mileage."
4.25,A True Benz ,AtlantaJim ,09/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,2,4,"After driving the 3-series and IS 250, the Benz just offered more of a ""best of all worlds"" package. The BMW is a better performer and the Lexus has a touch more luxury, but the Benz has the soul of a sports car with the comfort of a luxury machine.  The list of standard features is impressive, and I've never seen a car turn heads like this one.  ","Bluetooth phone, 6-speed stick, beautiful interior, solid build, infrequent maintenance, spirited performance. ","Better standard stereo, sunglass holder, better fuel economy"
4.875,Great Car,ginonyc ,09/04/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got this car several days ago and so far my experience has been great. Its fun to drive, looks sporty and definitely attracts a lot of attention. I think it will be a big hit with young drivers",Bluetooth,The interior looks a little cheap. I'd like to see less plastic
4.875,Switched from BMW to Mercedes,Tom in Phoenix ,08/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After looking at the BMW 328i and the 2008 Mercedes Benz 300C, I traded my 2004 BMW 330i on the Mercedes. I am very satisfied with the decision.  The MB is more pleasing to the eyes both inside and out.  And for those who may be looking for a not so harsh of a ride, but firmer than a Lexus, this is the vehicle.  MB did a great job with this new model. In my opinion, a better value for the money than the BMW 3 series.","Excellent seating positions; radio controls make sense and the viewing screen is large,very readable. 7 speed auto transmission is flawless.",Memory seats would be nice as a standard feature.
5,"So far, so good",JDHef ,08/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Very happy so far. I have the C300 Sport and I really like the exterior styling. The car is very comfortable and rides and handles very well. Pleasantly surprised to be getting about 25 MPG with the 7 speed automatic. Overall I feel it is a very good value for the money.,,One thing I would like is the ability to save AM/FM/Weather Band/Satilite stations on the same preset band. Or it would be nice to at least be able to switch from AM/FM/WB/Sat band from the steering wheel.
4.75,Got to love the new style and Beauty,cigarlvr ,08/18/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just got this car a few days ago but I have to say it is one heck of a automobile. Beautiful, very fast just be ready for lots of questions about it every place you go. I don't care if they are 15 or 70 they are all in blown away with the style it has to offer.",Bluetooth,Better stock radio system. My first stop was to replace speakers and add two amps
