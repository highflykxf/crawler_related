4,"Almost no problems; 2008 Silverado Reg cab, LB 4wd",C. Henry ,11/28/2015,,,4,,,,,4,,,,"Had to list this as a LT regular cab long bed, 4 wd. Actually is an LS, which in 2008, was just a Work Truck with a chromed front bumper and chromed steel wheels. Mine also has ""Trailering equipment package"", which is the same as ""Towing package"" without the locking G80 rear differential. It has the 4.8 with 4 speed auto. No power windows, no power locks, no cruise control, no power mirrors. Has A/C. The 4.8, thankfully, did not have the variable cylinder engine until a few years later. Then the 4.8 was dropped entirely.I purchased it new in Sept., 2008 at the old GM's fire sales. Truck was made the last week of 2008 production in June 2008. At their best plant at the time, Ft. Wayne. It has very dependable with almost no problems I do all maintenance on it. No rattles or squeaks at 65k.Currently at 65k miles. It has seen all sort of use from heavy urban gridlock to local country roads to Freeway use. I changed out all fluids between 50k and 60k miles. Brake, coolant, transmission, front differential, rear differential, and transfer case fluids. This year, at 62k miles, I replaced the front and rear brake rotors , drums, pads and shoes. The rear drum shoes were almost done, but the front pads could have gone another 10k. Engine consumes almost no oil between 4k to 5k oil changes.Non wear items replaced since new:--Rear shocks were shot at about 40k. Replaced with KYB gas-adjust mono tubes which are great and match the front strut valving well.--Turn signal clicker not audible at 50k. Sound for TS comes from left speaker. Unbelievably cheap paper door speakers replaced with cheap Pioneer speakers. --All good. ( common problem).That's it!I attribute the good reliability my Silverado has had to the fact it doesn't have the things that frequently cause trouble on the GMT's.--No cylinder deactivation on the 4.8 in that era. No piston ring/oil consumption or camshaft problems because of that.--No power locks or power windows which cause many problems.--No Eaton G80 locker rear differential which some people have experienced failure with. With manual shifted 4wd and an open rear axle I have had no trouble --making it through even heavy snow.Due to the lack of any power accessories and being a regular cab, the truck is fairly light. I believe this 4.8 can easily match or beat the ubiquitous 5.3 with extended or crew cab 1500 in acceleration.It has a very wide turning circle, but the use of rack and pinion steering starting in 2007.5 makes it pleasurable truck to drive. Gas mileage is not so good. When I commuted to work, with a total mix of driving, I averaged about 15.5 mpg. Mostly local roads  and shorter trips now. I seldom see more than 14 mpg. It will still do 17 to 18 mpg on infrequent Interstate highway runs. No mileage bonus with the 4.8 over the 5.3.Used buyers may like to know that GM in 2008 and post bankruptcy, 2009 made up different equipment packages that did not exist in catalogs. You may get something that shouldn't have been on your truck ( sometimes heated power mirrors on an LS trim) or not get something that should have been included.",,

Kind of a hybrid between a station wagon and a truck, lots of room and comfort in the cabin, not a lot of bed space.  I've had a few irritating problems, like having to replace one of the seat belt latches and tire pressure warning lights that don't work, but nothing major.  I'm looking for a new truck to replace it and will end up choosing either a Ford F-150 or another Silverado, probably the extended cab though rather than the crew cab model.

I'm still on the original tires. I will replace them around 50000 as they will need it. The only thing I have needed to do was change the front brakes on the truck around 18000 miles and I had to take the truck to the dealer around the 2.8 year mark when the pass door lock stopped working. Apparently this is common because there was another (2007-2012 Chevy Silverado 1500) owner in front of me getting the same pass door lock replaced. Also I had to add some coolant around the 1.5 year mark because in traffic it would start getting warmer as in not in the middle of the gauge where the temp is supposed to be.,Drives great and has been reliable so far.,"Make the door locks stronger. Occasionally it idles rough, starting around 800 miles, so far no issues but its made me wonder. I got a notice letter from Chevy but the dealer (Hudiberg, OKC)told me if they inspect it and find nothing wrong I would owe them the hourly maintenance fee. "

I keep reading reviews that say things like "" transmission sucks"" and ""truck wont last over 60k!!"" really people!?! I am a aircraft mechanic and have a long understanding of how engines and machines run. I own a 2008 chevy 1500 Z71 and have had ZERO issues with the vehicle, and you know why? Its simple.. buy a service manual and follow the maintance schedule!!! Change fluids and insert some grease here and there and i can almost promise you will have zero maintance failures!

It turns like a 18 wheeler, you have to swing real wide to get her fat ass in a parking spot. Plastic that hides the mounting brakets to the seat break off. CITY gas miliage is horrible.. but its a huge truck and it is what it is people! My biggest issue is the ride quality.

The build quality is better than many of the foreign trucks for the first time ever, and a huge step up over previous models.  Gas mileage for me has been about 15.5mpg with mostly city driving and a lot of 4wd in the winter.  Other than a fender bender which caused no body damage other than the PLASTIC flashing below the bumper that was easy to remove, I've had no mechanical issues.  The cloth seats are comfortable but collect lint like mad and already are falling apart at the seams.  The ride is great though, and the back seats easily fit my 3 kids on 6 hour fishing trips without a problem","Ride quality is great, and build quality, especially fit and finish is great for a non-import.  I added dual exhaust and a K&M CAI for fun, the interior is still pretty quiet even with the exhaust.  Utility is great for hauling and fishing. and she has handled the crazy snows this year with ease.","Lots.  gas mileage is horrible and it should have more than 4-speed.

This continued with repeated trips to Dealer. Well, we have had to replace a map sensor, valve spring, 2 oxygen sensors (not under warranty), manifold and gasket,& wiring to cargo lamp. That's not the end. We now have no dome light, there is a chattering noise by the dash board when you let off the gas and go from 55 down to 40-45 (very annoying). We traded a 2 year old Dodge P.U. (fully loaded) for a Chevy (with less on it) and all we got was approx. 3 miles more to the gallon on gas, and a truck with problems and not a comfortable to ride in. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!",,

I have back problems and have had no problems when driving this truck. A little extra lumbar support would be Nice. What they have helps but it could be better. I love the interior except I would have liked more cup holders like everyone else. The stock tires tend to spin on wet roads and I plan on buying better tires when I can afford to.

Overall love the truck, except the front clearance for a 4x4. Cracked the license plate frame the first week crossing a frozen creek. Ended up adding a 4 inch Rancho lift and it handles even better with a better ride and turning radius. The approach and departure angles along with articulation is infinitely better. Highly recommended if you are actually going to take it off road. I got 21-22 MPG on the highway before the lift and adding 33 inch mud tires. Now about 18, still great for what it is. Stock tires were useless offroad. Other complaint: stock skid plates are plastic.","Interior well laid out. MPG+power combo, reliable, comfortable, does what I ask it to do.

As this is a business truck and I spend a lot of time in it. the ride is fantastic. The 4x4 can't be beat. Great interior although it is lacking in cup holders and storage space. Only one problem so far and that is the stereo. Once the Serious radio was turned off I noticed the radio volume fluctuates horribly as the radio struggles to pick up the digital radio transmission. This is not due to the auto volume adjust option. Just poor radio design. It is so bad that if I don't have a CD to listen to, the radio is turned off. Wished it had a non-satellite radio.

Same basic powertrain, but 5.3 now with flex fuel, same 4L60, but I am almost sure that GM has stopped using that junk rear end supplier that plagued the previous body truck.

The engine (5.3L) is really good on gas and provides loads of horsepower. The ride feels very firm and the truck's standard features are great!  My buddy's Ridgeline (that he bought a week before my purchase) is a lesser truck in all areas.  He regrets his purchase after riding in mine. I haven't used to roadside assistance but am happy to have it. My advice... Before buying anything else- go drive a Chevy and you will buy it. Best truck ever! This truck is perfect in all areas. Make sure you buy the 5.3 L so you can get great gas mileage and still smoke the tires. Buy the level of truck that you want. The LT1 package was good for me.

You really have to slide forward to get a comfortable position thereby placing your knees very close to the lower dash. (2) No locking fuel filler door. (3) No grab handle for the driver. GM uses the weak excuse that a wiring harness goes up the driver side pillar. (4) Poor design lower dash trim panel (closest to your knees) that protudes rearward instead of forward further reducing leg room. (5) Poor radio control placement. The most used knob, the one to change stations is on the far right. This makes a long reach. Should have been on the left of the radio.",Locking tailgate.

This is good for long trips. The access to OnStar is a very nice feature as well.,Caller ID would be nice for incoming phone calls. A cloth floor mat would be better than a rubber one.

I am so glad that I bought this truck.  The secret to the AFM is to use the V8 to get to your speed (55 to 65 is the ""sweet spot""), let off the gas slightly until the V4 kicks in then gently back on the gas and hold it to the next hill and repeat.

But, why oh why has GM made the 1/2 ton trucks so low to the ground. Had to put a 2.5"" leveling kit in the front to take that nose dive out of the front end. Also, they made a change in the steering that is way too responsive. The slightest little movement and you're going off into the next lane which does get very scarry with any hiway traffic. They put the radio controls a little out of reach so changing the station on the radio has become a frightening situation.

I was replacing an F150 that had been a very very good truck for the 7 years I owned it. Not one issue ever. So naturally I was inclined towards the Ford. After driving all the trucks I decided on the Chevy. I likes the power from the 6.0L compared to the Ford which seemed pretty weak in the pwer department. The Toyota used very poor interior materials and rode terrible. The Dodge was nice but the bed was 6.25 feet compared to the others 6.5ft bed. Overall the Chevy offered a great combination of features with the LTZ package and the Vortec Max package.",The 6.0L V8 is powerful and on my commute to and from work it averages 19mpg. I also like the remote start and the design of the interior. The Vortec Max package gives you 4 wheel disc brakes which I think is important.,"Offer the 6 speed automatic, make 4 wheel disc brakes standard and the tie down hooks in the bed are nearly useless.

I did have a leak in the front trasfer case, took it in and they found nothing. It hasn't leaked since. Looked like a seal was leaking. The only complaint I have is something I have seen on here, the cloth seats need constant removal of lint and seat shedding. Didn't know if this was due to ""new"" seats or if this will be a constant battle. Maybe should have spent the extra money for leather. Other than that it is an awesome truck, get lots of looks and compliments. Added a soft bed cover, spray in liner and chrome door handles. Back in black and lovin ever minute of it.

I never considered happiness could be had in a pick-up truck until the rental company put me in a crew cab Silverado for 30 days. I had to have one.

The 20"" factory tires rub on the GM mudflaps when you turn sharp, the dealer tells me there is nothing more they can do. Some of the double faced tape that holds the body side moldings to the doors was too long and I had to trim off. I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the active fuel management system seems to be a joke. I just returned from a 3600 mile trip and averaged 18 mpg.

4.5,Standard box does not align with cab,roscoe ,04/09/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,4,4,5,I love the handling and performance. It is a sharp truck; sits up high unlike any of the past GM trucks that I have owned. The V6 has plenty of power and the interior is stylish and comfortable. The only thing that I can find troubling is the way the box does not line up to the cab the same on each side. It seems the box is build slightly crooked. I have checked several other new trucks and they are all the same. I would love to hear if anyone else has noticed this imperfection. Other than this I think Chevy has hit a home-run.,OnStar is great for security. Steering and handling is fantastic. Headlights and taillights are large and bright combined with sitting up high lends to a great sight pattern when driving. ,The only thing I can find wrong is the alignment of the box in respect to the cab.

My first road trip averaged 18 MPG. Hopefully it will get better as it breaks in. Chevy did away with the ""plug & play"" trailer brake controller harness. You'll find the wire bundle under the dash, plus 2 taped wires under the hood that have to be connected, plus an added fuse to buy. My biggest complaint: The doors lock automatically, either when shifting or at a factory set speed.  There is no way to disable the auto locks. #2 is the required use of the keyless remote. Unlocking the driver's door with the key sets off the alarm. No way to change this either, I'm told.","Ride, handling, improved interior","Ability to disable auto door locks.

I installed mud flaps over the weekend an noticed how easily the rear fenders flexed.
