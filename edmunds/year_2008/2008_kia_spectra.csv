4,BEWARE!!! Engine dies - Steering wheel locks!,C.B. Dunlevy ,06/25/2016,4,3,4,,,1,1,4,4,,,"■ 2016 April 23	I brought my car in for the regular “The Works” package maintenance to Kia of Dayton.  Thereafter, my car ran a little rough.  I did not think much of it until my car began “pausing/hesitating” as I drove it. ■ 2016 May 25	I was driving to an interview and thought the car was going to die on the highway.  My car has never behaved like this; and, again, this was after the most recent routine maintenance on April 23, 2016.  In addition, sometimes when I put on the brakes, the car stops and then lunges forward.  This does not happen all the time; it happens intermittently.■ 2016 June 10	I had my two twin granddaughters in the car.  We met my husband for lunch and then went to Kettering Hospital to visit a relative.  While driving in city traffic (going approximately 35 MPH), I gradually applied the brakes to stop at a stop light.  When the light turned green, I realized that the engine had died.  This concerned me as this has never happened.■ 2016 June 13	I brought my car in to the dealership and described what was occurring.  A diagnostics was performed and the car was driven.  The Tech advised that nothing showed on the diagnostics and that when the car was driven, no issues occurred. ■ 2016 June 18	I drove from my house to the local grocery and back to my home.  As I went to make a right-hand turn from, I gradually braked, made the turn and then realized the engine had died because my steering wheel locked!  I had the air conditioner on, the radio on and was singing to it, so I did not hear the engine die.  Further, because I could not steer, I went into the other lane and thankfully, no one was in the lane or I would have hit them.  In addition, if someone would have been behind me, they would have hit me as they would not have expected me to turn and suddenly stop—especially since I did not have my foot on the brake after I turned. ■ 2016 June 20	I took my car back in to Kia of Dayton and reported the June 18, 2016 incident.  I told the tech that I was very concerned about these incidents and relayed that I considered these to be very dangerous and life-threatening.  I also called the Fixed Operations Director, and relayed that my car has been running rough since I got it back on 4/23/2016, feels like it is pausing/hesitating when I drive it; died while I was driving it without warning on 6/10/2016. (I had put on the brake for a stop light and did not know it had died until I tried to accelerate.)  I advised that the diagnostics done on 6/13/2016 did not produce anything and that I thought maybe all of this was just  an odd happening, so I continued to drive the car.  On 6/18/2016, when I was right turning, the car died and the steering wheel locked and that I considered these incidents to be extremely dangerous and life threatening.I called the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and provided information regarding this issue.  I wrote the Fixed Operations Director a letter documenting the incidents and my concerns and noted that I had copied the NHTSA.2016 June 22	the tech called and said that they ran another electronic diagnostic and have driven the car over 50 miles and nothing shows up on the diagnostic and they cannot reproduce the incidents.  I reiterated that I do not feel safe driving the car.  I asked if any of the incidents were recorded in the car’s memory.  No.  I asked if the sensors in the car were able to record things like this.  No.  So, the sensors are not sensitive enough to record such incidents.  I asked him what might cause the car to pause/hesitate while I am driving and he said that it might be the spark plugs.  I asked if he checked these and he said no as that would mean that they need to tear apart the car to check these.  I also asked about the fuel filter and the same thing applies.  He said that tearing apart the car and looking at it will cost me.2016 June 23	I called and left a message with the Fixed Opertions Director around 12:30 pm advising that I would like to speak to him regarding my car.  Since I did not hear back from him, I called Kia of Dayton and asked for the corporate office # and was given 1.270.783.8080.  I called and spoke with a woman named Tricia.  I explained to her what was going on with my vehicle and she suggested that I call and speak with the General Manager of Kia of Dayton. I called Kia of Dayton and spoke with the General Manager and conveyed my concerns about how serious these incidents are.  He offered to do a trade in with me. Unbelievable.  I advised that I am the only owner of this vehicle, that she has run fine until 4/23/2016. I am currently waiting for Kia Corporate to look into all of this as an internet search documents that the issue of Kia's suddenly dying while being driven goes back to at least the 2001 models.  Query as to how many ""accidents"" have occurred that were attributed to a driver when it was a product failure!  BEWARE!!! And, I love my car.... :-(",,
4,"Some problems, but good car",mountaineer6 ,04/07/2014,,,4,3,3,4,,4,4,5,5,"I bought my 2008 Spectra about 2 years ago with 18,000 miles Certified Pre-Owned. Only major problem I've had is the front end is so out of whack (sometime shaking violently at highway speeds other times not and knocking noise), and no one can seem to fix it. Was told it was probably the tires, so I replaced them for the problem to resurface as soon as the were worn in. Now I'm about to drop another $500 to replace the front struts and hopefully resolve the issue. Kia says that it isn't covered under the warranty (because apparently the struts on a car with 40,000 miles should go bad.)

4.375,Best Valued Commute Car!,themagicfarmer ,05/02/2013,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,5,5,"Bought my 08 Spectra (with 18K on it) from an official Kia dealer about a year ago. No disappointment so far. The car has all necessary functions, basically powered everything, Air conditioning and so forth. It's built cheap but in a simple and neat fashion, plus designed with safety and accessibility in mind. Spacious, driver's seat, back seats and truck, every where.Kia's service center is excellent too. They perform everything necessary, and never charge for pointless services, like mandatory car wash if serviced which many Honda dealers do. It's the type of shop you want to rely on. (my dealer is located 3 mins from where I live, I'm happy!)To sum up, isn't it an ideal commute car?","Practical design. More than enough power, if you get the manual. Spacious storage. AUX plug. Dual 12-V power outlets. ","If any improvements suggest higher price, then seriously, nothing. 

Of course, if not, who would mind stuff like better look, more power, more accessories, more steel, bigger and the best if it prints money. "

My collision was at 40 mph, with an immoveable object. (Tree) Yes, I was sober.My Kia took great care of me in the accident, crumpled all around me with no serious damage to the passenger compartment. I wish the exterior panels had not been so damaged, but I will trade the totaled exterior for the protected interior any day. I walked away with just a tiny cut on my finger from the broken glass.I found an 08 with 5,000 miles and we are settling in nicely. I expect to have a long and happy life with my new Spectra.",,

4.75,Wanted a Wagon,Greg ,09/13/2010,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,4,Overall i like the car it's got good power and a lot of features for the money. It has a quit cabin and  handles bumps in the road like a more expensive car. I have been on a few camping trips with this car and it was a joy to drive.,"My favorite features are the good power, the good looks and the interior looks like a more expensive interior.","I would like the drivers seat to adjust lower then it does, i sit too high. also i don't no what it is but i am having trouble getting used to the clutch but i can jump into a new honda for example and i can work the clutch perfectly with zero learning time, i work in a garage so i drive many cars."
4.875,My only Problem is Humming Noise,Dwight Judd ,06/17/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I enjoy driving the car it has great pick up. Now the problem that I'm having is when I'm driving the car and the wind is blowing at the passenger side of the car I'm picking up a high pitching humming noise inside the car sounds like it's coming from the driver side dash and window area but not sure. ,My wife is short and she loves the way the drivers seat goes up. And our son is tall and there's room for him in the back. I also like that pad on the driver sides floor board.  ,Make the seats electrical because she has lupus in her joints and it makes it tough for her some days

Took one look at my white EX 5spd rear spoiler, and I was hooked. So long story short 2 1/2 yrs later and car approaching 60,000 miles on it now, not a thing has gone wrong. People always comment on my car, and how clean and good it has held up! I take care of my car but don't baby it! I think it handles really well, and at times I feel like I'm in a sports car. The rear spoiler makes it look so much better and 5 spd Overdrive, I don't have to always down shift up hills (only when some trucker or slow car gets in front of me.

4.25,Not bad for the money,Bryan ,12/30/2009,,,4,4,3,5,,4,4,5,5,"I am a young driver(21) bought this when I was 19(actually still making payments) and this has been a great car. The 5 speed really lets you open up the engine and get the most out of it and I wouldn't have it any other way. Mine has developed a rather strange problem lately, the rear floorboards are getting soaked but there is no leake up top, so I am guessing water is coming in from the bottom? This will be my first experience with KIA customer service so I hope they treat me well and I get my car back soon. This seems like a rare problem so I won't blame the car just yet. Overall, great car for the money hands down.","A/C(first car that has had A/C that worked:) Dependable, just fun to drive (5 speed) Comfortable, has been on many trips, will go on many more in it with no doubts.","Change the back end, the tail lights are huge!

I was hoping it would hold up and the dealership would honor the warranty but  after taking it in three times for the door on the gas cap, they said it was a poor design and only cleaned it again.. and were so rude! they said I must have broken it and the seat belt that wouldn't retract.. the side door wouldn't always close.. and I always smelt something burning.. I wasn't planning to sell it in a year after buying new but lost confidence in this car and the warranty.. it is very top heavy and not a good car to drive in the real world..

5,Great Car,hdwestmont ,07/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this car in February and since then have already put over 7,000 miles on it.  I drive a lot! I've never gotten worse than 27 mpg and have gotten as good as 38, and trust me, I don't drive like an old woman and that's usually with the AC on too.  Was planning on buying an American car, but after endless test drives, this car had more get up and go (compared to Pontiac Vibe, Dodge Caliber).  I also liked it better than the Nissan Versa (way over priced) and the Toyota Matrix (also way over priced).  All in all, It's been a great car, got more options for less money and it doesn't look like a pregnant roller skate! =)","the ipod jack, cruise control, AC, power locks and windows, tons of room! good mpg, good stock sound system (i drove a 1973 Chevy Nova for almost 5 years, you learn to appreciate the small things)","I've noticed the parking lights will sometimes come on if you leave the lights in the on position, easy fix though, turn them off.

4.5,2008 Kia Spectra,Bob E. ,03/28/2009,,,5,5,2,5,,5,5,5,4,"Overall the vehicle has done what I needed and expected.  Power is fine, mileage was about 30-31 mpg until I reached 25000 miles then I tipped 38mpg a few times depending upon passenger content, and city/highway percentage of driving when tracking the mpg of a tank of fuel.  Sound system is good with nice bass and crisp highs.  My tires wore out at 27000 miles to the wear bars even though I kept pressure monitored closely and rotated according to recommendations, but you know how the new car new tires are worse mileage than the ones you replace them with! The only thing would keep me from another spectra purchase is the timing belt has terrible moaning noise in the engine. Dlr says its fine!","Mileage per gallon, Stereo system has good sound, adequate power to get into traffic, leg room for a small car, maneuverability in traffic and parking lot is good.","Get rid of the terrible relentless moaning, whining, noise from the engines timing belt area!!!

2.5,First and Last Kia,stoneattic ,03/06/2009,,,3,3,2,1,,2,3,3,3,"If you use the stereo aux with a satellite radio or charging ipod there is a very noticeable alternator whine. The dealer had it twice, now claims that's the way it's supposed to work. If you are going to have a convenience feature it should work properly. As annoying as this is the real clincher is that the parking lights will go on by themselves in the middle of the night for no reason, draining the battery. I'm not the only one with this. Search Kia forums and you will find many with the same issue. Kia claims a new BCM will fix it, but it hasn't corrected mine. Then there's the goofy shift points, but there's not enough room to list all of my complaints. Dealer is awful too.",Styling is nice and is overall a nice looking car.  Except for the 1-2 gear shifting it's not bad to drive.,Fix the light issue or have a buzzer when the lights are left in the auto/on position. Filter/isolate the power ports so the aux port is useful. Correct the goofy shifting/gearing. It pulls from a stop well then falls on it's face.

4,Unresolved Problems,Peggy ,03/05/2009,,,4,4,4,5,,5,4,2,4,"I purchased the Spectra5 for gas mileage reasons and it was a cute car.  It was great for the first 4.5 months - consistently 30 to 35mpg and the car was so quiet stopped or running.  After that I get 15 to 20mpg with no changes to driving habits, route traveled or where gas purchased and the car is a lot louder.  Service dept blames it on weather, car breaking in or just say they don't know and no attempt to look it over.  It started at the end of summer before cold started.  Make sure that you buy from a dealer that cares.  I should have kept my SVU - same gas mileage and no car payment.

Overall I enjoyed the Spectra5, and it did pretty well with a rear collision at 50 mph. Pushed me into another car, so both the front and back ends got it, but neither crumpled that far. Safety-wise it did pretty good. The driver seat during the collision slid to the back and put me into a reclining position. Strange, but not a serious fault in my opinion. So, good on safety, brakes stopped me, but the Civic behind me... not so much.","Aux. port, comfy seats - great on long drives, hatchback - so nice for moving large things, windshield washer - one gallon actually fits in there, usually you fit in 0.9 gallons and end up throwing some or saving it in your car.

Although I was happy with my Spectra, I went to CarMax to see what else was out there.  I drove a half a dozen cars or so, and nothing was better than what I had.  I purchased another Spectra and have been very happy with it.  I must have gotten a good one because I routinely get just over 40 miles to the gal.

It has a lot of extras you would not expect such as  place to plug in ipod, sturdy cup holders including ones in back seat, CD player, etc.  What I found amazing was that this car had all these extras but cruise control is not standard.

5,What a fun surprise!,Kia Mia ,11/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I wasn't looking for a Kia when I went to this dealership. A salesman talked me into test driving a Spectra 5. I was totally surprised at how quiet and smooth this vehicle was. Road noise was absolutely minimal! The great looking interior is very comfortable. All instruments and accessories are easy to use while driving. I drove this car cross country twice and it was very comfortable the whole way. The car is very stylish. I've had numerous people inquiring about it with great interest. My wife liked the car so much that I gave it to her and bought another one, identical to it! The one thing I would change would be to have head rests that pivot from front to back.  What a treat! ","The Electric Orange paint, the smooth quiet ride, and the overall stylish look of the car.",Pivoting headrests.
5,Kia Spectra-Thumbs Up!,KiaFan ,11/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I drove my Kia Spectra EX Automatic over 3700 miles in Western Canada and USA after buying one month before. Excellent comfort, cruise control was flawless, held the road well, achieved average of 35 mpg (39 in one stretch), great brakes. Plenty adequate pickup on entering a freeway. Very quiet engine at highway speed of 70 or at idle (wondered if in was running while waiting at a stop sign). The finish and fit is excellent. The price was right - at least $3000 less than a Corolla or Civic or Jetta. I also checked it to its sister/brother the Hyundai Elantra... compares well, same engine, nicer interior. Stereo/CD radio very good. Great warranty.","Comfortable ride and agile handling, quiet engine and interior, good looks, 4-wheel disk brakes, great gas mileage, price, warranty, and dealer care.",Can't think of any right now. Kia/Hyundai make a great car! 
4.25,Nice car for the money,ikillbugs ,10/14/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I bought my 2008 Kia used but with very few miles on it. I love the looks and the overall ride is excellent, even at 80 mph on the interstate (although past 80 it does get a bit shaky).  I got the EX model, and given a choice (after the fact) I would certainly look for an SX model with the sportier suspension. It does not handle that well in tight corners, but I bought it for a commuter, not a race car.  I rated it at 8 for BUILD QUALITY and RELIABILITY simply because I just don't know. I have only had the car a month. So far so good ;-)","Appearance, interior styling and comfort, Auto-Off headlights",Better stereo. The stock CD/stereo system is pretty much mediocre at best. I replaced the unit with a low-end Pioneer from Wal-Mart and it greatly outperforms the stock unit.
5,My next car will be a Kia,Derrick ,10/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I love it.  It looks great in a parking lot and sexy on the road! My friends and family all want to drive it and wish their car was a kia.  I love my spectra sx!,"Remote start, great radio/ cd player",the passenger seat should be more like the drivers seat. Its a bit too firm.
2.625,Buyer's Remorse,James ,10/06/2008,,,2,3,2,3,,5,2,2,2,"This vehicle is really uncomfortable to drive for more than an hour.  The driver's seat curves up sharply jabbing into your rear end.  I'm not a skinny guy, but by no means large either.  But the real disappointment is in the 23 mpg avg I'm getting.  Mostly highway, this is very disappointing in a car this size.  Now one nice thing is that the controls are easy to reach.  Second, this car really has some kick.  It will jump out in traffic like a 6 cylinder vehicle if you need to.  But it fails to be a good ride and to be economical to drive.","Nice acceleration, easy to reach controls.","More comfortable seats, better fuel efficiency."
5,Outstanding! Move over Toyota!,joe ,09/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Before you pay more for a Toyota, Honda,etc, you owe it to yourself to look at the Kia! I bought this car a month ago and i can't say enough good about it. Style and features outside are great! Interior features and style, looks and feels awesome, then we get to the best part. This car handles and drives incredibly! I have the SX model which has the sport tuned suspension and it handles and feels like a sports car! I don't understand edmunds review about the motor. They say it gets noisy at high rpm, not mine! The 2.0 in this car has plenty of power and does not require high rev's to push or pass! I have the 5 speed manual, it's great! Don't overlook the Kia, you'll just pay more!",Fun to drive! Solid built car! I feel confident this will be a dependable long lasting vehicle! ,"Sound system could be better. Sounds great, i was honestly shocked at first how good it sounded, but if you really like it loud, the sound system can distort some at high volumes! "
4.875,Bought another,B.J. Miller ,09/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"I originally had a 2006 Spectra which was totaled in an accident when someone lost control of their SUV after they were hit by someone who ran a stop sign.  Fortunately the airbag worked well.  I was very happy with my 2006 Spectra but before I purchased another one, I wanted to see what other options I had. I drove every make and model out there and could find nothing else that I was more comfortable in or satisfied with than the Spectra, so I promptly purchased another one and have not had, even for a second, any regrets.  I even turned down a purchase of a 2005 Jaguar that was selling for the same price as the Spectra. I found reviews of the Spectra to be more reliable than the Jag.","The gas mileage!!  It's rated for about 34 mpg, but I routinely get 40+ mpg.  I drive a stick shift, and I'm sure that helps a little bit.  The gas mileage does take a bit of a dip, though, when the AC is used.  During a particularly hot week here, I got 32 mpg with the AC on Max.","For some reason, the inside of the windows need to be cleaned often. I don't know if this in an effect from using the defrost/AC or if it's the plasticizers from the dashboard.  This is being very nitpicky though...It's a great car."
4.75,Great purchase,Keepintune ,08/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Traded in a Ford Explorer XLT due to gas mileage.  I am a piano technician and have to carry tools at all times. This was a great choice after searching for 3 months.  Compared American, Japanese and Korean cars.  I wanted the Prius, but there were none to be had, and then dealers were selling for ""market price"".  I made a great choice for me.  I am 6'3"" and above 250 lbs.  Comfort is there for leg room, but to me, seat surfaces are not soft enough. That being my only complaint of the inside, everything else is great.  I love the stereo-great sound and flexibility; cd changer, ipod & xm to Aux input is fabulous.  Easy to work.  Car well laid out.  Easy to read instruments.","Stereo excellent and flexible, dash well designed - easy to see details, steering wheel nice with leather.  Outside of car is sharp, and I notice people giving it a double take when passing by.  Great wheels, body flares, chrome exhaust tip, metal pedals and spoiler.  Doors & tail gate easy to open.","Haven't seen gas mileage published, but with only 2200 miles on the car, confident the mileage will get better.  The only thing I can recommend is to make seating surfaces softer.  Compared to other  cares driven, seat surfaces are too hard."
5,Great Buy!,Tina ,08/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is my first new car and I don't think I could have done any better! Smooth driving and great gas mileage. ,You don't feel it shift witch is a plus! Mirrors are self defrost witch helps in the winter time. ,"ABS system, Cruise control. Darker seats not to fond of white / light gray. Thats about it!"
4,Bargain Small Car,Rob ,07/27/2008,,,5,4,4,4,,3,4,4,4,"This is a fine small car that has all of the features you need at a price considerably less than the Japanese makes. Quality of the major Korean brands has improved markedly over the last 15 to 20 years and they are almost on par with the major Japanese brands. The ride is surprisingly smooth and quiet. Engine power is adequate but no ""ball of fire"". Handling is ok but this is no sports car.  This is a great first car for a teen or a second car for getting around town. With rebates the selling price of this car was $14,200 + TTL vs. a list price of $16,700.  That is a strong price vs. what late model used cars are selling for without the strong factory warranty. ","Strong Warranty.  This particular model comes fully equipped with power windows, locks and mirrors.  Has a decent standard radio/cd player. Tilt steering wheel.  console port for IPOD or other music player. Ultimate feature was very low price compared to Japanese competitors and used cars. ","Standard ABS;  trip computer with mpg, miles till empty, etc.  Power seat option. 5 speed automatic.  Fuel economy is very good but not quite at the level of Toyota and Honda. "
4,Right Stuff,Mush ,07/15/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,4,3,4,4,"The spectra 5 auto is fun and easy to drive. It looks great, holds the road real good and handles better than the Camry LE 2008 sedan which I test drove. I also test drove the Honda Civic 2008 but with all elements considered, I bought the Kia. Kia has good driving visibility (I am short) and the hatchback is a plus in this price range (cheaper by about $5K). ","Sporty, cruise control, leather wrapped steering wheel. Added options I bought are sunroof, 6 CD changer, ABS. Really like spark blue color, long warranty, and fog lights. I also appreciate the steering wheel, which usually comes on higher upscale vehicles and SUVs. Remote keyless entry another plus","Seats could be more comfy, lack of arm rests. Not essential, but would have been nice. With all things considered, the Kia was the best choice. "
5,Surprisingly Good Car,jabhiji ,07/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have owned a LX for about a month now and have been pleasantly surprised at the gas economy and reliability so far. Most of the miles so far are on the highway (with the A/C on) and I have consistently obtained 34+ MPG, with the maximum so far being 37.8 MPG. The vehicle handles very well on the highway, but can be a bit awkward at low speeds. Does not handle turns very well, even at low speeds. Feels like the car is going to rollover if you take those curved exit ramps at more than 30 to 35 mph. But overall, considering the price, I am a very satisfied owner.",Cost and fuel efficiency,"Improved turning capability, Seat belt warning for front passenger seat."
4.875,good car,bnk ,07/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,i had a rodeo before so it sucked the gas and I went and bought this car. It's not too fast but it's the sx so it's sporty.

4.125,Can't beat 'em,AJ ,06/29/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,5,"I traded in my 05 Kia sportage v6 for the spectra5 sx and I gotta say, you can't go wrong with these cars. I had to trade for better mileage which wasn't very good on the sportage and I'm glad I did. The spectra is fun, sprite, well equipped, and a lot of bang for the buck. I compared Mazda3, Pontiac Vibe and Chevy Malibu and in the end I stuck with what I knew.",The brakes are super on this car. They come on right now.,I would recommend a radio improvement. The 6disc is a great feature but the speakers leave much to be desired.
5,More than I expected,Islanders ,06/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have only had the Spectra5 for a week, but I'm 6'3'' and have plenty of head room and enough leg room in both the front and back seats. The cabin is roomy with good cargo space.  Nice trim kit, power windows, locks, strong AC. A great car to drive. I'm also impressed with the build quality.  Nice solid feel to the transmission, and engine, etc from the first time I test drove it. Getting 30 mpg mixed driving with AC on. I'm trying to conserve fuel, but also haven't been passed by anyone. That might drop a little if it is a real grid lock urban crawl. So far I'm very pleased. I had a trailer hitch installed for a bike rack. Also getting Thule roof racks and sat radio. Great car.","Headroom, handling, peppy, good quality build, see above. Great value for room and  gas mileage. I thought I would hate driving a compact car that could get 30+ mpg, so far I'm delighted, and feel liberated. The new Saturn also looks good, while the Kia is less expensive with the rebate.","The seat adjustment is fine, but could use a few more reclining options for the base to tilt back up under the legs. Not a problem for me, though. ABS standard. I didn't realize it wasn't included, but it's a small car so no big deal. Overall I'm very pleased. Hopefully it will be very reliable car."
4.5,"Great value, like all the ""kiadai"" cars",Jose in Dallas ,06/11/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"Overall this vehicle is great for a subcompact. The Hyundai 2.0 L sounds fantastic at 6000 RPM but gets rather thirsty. Engine noise is very little until you get on the freeway. Very comfy suspension with the smoothness of a Caddy until you take a sharp corner where it leans like a pickup truck. The overall build and quality of these Korean cars (Hyundai & Kia) has been improving every year but they are still not on the same level as the Japanese. With the 100,000 Mi warranty the vehicle is a great value for the price.","Has 6 standard airbags, great audio system, smooth ride, little wind noise, strong 4-wheel disc brakes, smooth Hyundai engine with CVVT.","Standard ABS, stiffer springs in the front , 5 speed automatic, higher quality interior carpets."

Highly recommended by his owner.","Absolutely beautiful car, with a fun, fast and reliable engine. An absolute blast to drive and everything is laid out intuitively for easy access.","Some of the interior quality could be improved, is a bit noisy and little things have been found like loose screws and weak door seals letting in a lot of noise."
5,Replaced a 1997 Gr Caravan,Mike ,06/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We had just purchased an Optima for my wife and I had noticed the Spectre5 on the lot.  Not many cars make me stop and give them a second look, but this one did.  Some quick reference checks and I bought it 3 days later.  Although I miss the room in my Caravan I have to say this is one of the most fun cars to drive.  Gas mileage has been just under 30 MPG in mostly city type driving but I know that will get better as it breaks in.  Although no car is perfect I haven't found any major items to complain about.  There has been some talk of Kia not honoring their warranty but you just need to maintain very through records if not serviced at a KIA dealer,",Very agile handling on the road.

4.375,08 Kia a good buy,irishgreg83 ,05/24/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,3,5,4,"I have owned my kia for about three weeks now, and I have to say I really like this car. I was a little worried switching to a 4cyl foreign car, after drving 6 cyl chevys for as long as I have been driving. The car feels very sturdy while driving it. The 2.0 liter engine can get up and go although the engine gets kinda load over 4000 rpm. I get greats gas mileage, sometimes close to 38 mpg on the highway at reasonable speeds (80 mph or less). The drivers seat leaves a good bit of room for the driver which is nice if you are 6 ft plus, and there is plenty of head room. All in all I am happy I chose this car you cant beat it for the price.","I like the cruise control it's worth the extra 200 bucks, There is plenty of trunk room even though it wouldn't appear that way looking at the outside, and the tire pressure monitoring system should come in real handy.",ABS should be standard
5,Luv my car,kath ,05/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I luv this car! I have gone from a suburban to this highly fuel efficient compact car. I drive approx. 60+ miles per day. It is very smooth and fun to drive. I thought the big car small car transition would be hard. Not a problem at all. But, when I go from this car to my husband's suburban I feel like I'm driving a bus. Have had about 1 month and getting 31 MPG in town. My mom bought one at the same time and she can't keep my dad out of it. It's hard to explain. You just have to test drive. It has a lot of get up and go. Very easy to maneuver. Can't say enough good things. Have the SX standard. Mom has the SX automatic, sister the EX, nephew the SX and I will be going back for one for my son.",Just Fun! Like the sporty look of my SX.

After looking at other vehicles in this class (Dodge Caliber/ Avenger, Ford Focus, etc) I believe this to be the best value, by far. The 2.0 with a manual is peppy, the engine is all but unnoticeable until 4k rpm (About 80+ in 5th), and with all the convenience features I got, makes me feel like I got a great deal. Gas mileage has been 22ish (city) thus far, but I only have about 150mi on her right now, and by all accounts mpg gets much better as it breaks in. Overall a great car for a person who needs affordable transportation, but likes a car to have a bit of pep and personality. ","Power Everything! Nice quiet interior, smooth ride. Drives and rides like a much bigger car. Great interior layout, comfortable seats and logical layout of all controls makes driving very intuitive. Every KIA I have owned has been rock solid on reliability, and this one seems the best built yet!","The light gray interior shows any amount of dirt, tan or a dark gray would be better. Shifter seems a bit vague at times and Body roll can be noticeable in high speed cornering, but if you buy this car to be Speed Racer you need mental help anyway.

5,Great Value for the Dollar!,G.Peter ,01/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is one of finest compact cars on the market today.  The features that this car offers are absolutely phenomenal.  I initially checked out other compact cars such as the Dodge Caliber, Toyota Matrix, Pontiac Vibe, and Nissan Sentra.  I have to admit that each of those cars left me desiring and seeking much more.  Then I decided to check out the Kia Spectra 5 and that was the best decision I could have made.  The car was everything I was looking for in a compact car.  The look was sporty.  The exterior quality was extremely obvious.  The interior was loaded with features that even some bigger cars and SUVs didn't have. Then came the drive.  I was sold and the car was mine.  Thank you Kia.","The sporty looking exterior.  The smooth, yet firm suspension.  The interior quality fit and finish.  The MP3 auxiliary port.  The attractive accents to the interior.  Oh...yes...great mileage with a peppy engine.  This vehicle is truly awesome.  Total value for the dollar.",This is a hard one since this vehicle impressed me so much.  The only thing that I can think of is to make available a 5 speed automatic transmission.  Not that the current one isn't efficient enough.

No wind noise in the interior unless wind is really blowing outside (30+ mph). Suspension a little soft. Sounds like it is bottoming out when I hit a pothole. I intend to keep this car a long time. If it is reliable, this car is an excellent buy.",Like the style and utility. Sound system is very good.

I do a LOT of business driving, and love the roominess of the hatchback when I have to carry my supplies with me. The peppy 2.0 liter engine with the 5- speed makes this car a blast to drive. I'm getting almost 30 mpg in town, and closer to 35 on the open road.  I haven't run out of power when passing or accelerating, and it climbs in the mountains great too!

There are some slight noises through the cabin, but overall fit and finish is very good. The manual transmission is the way to go to get the most from the engine, though the clutch takes a little getting used to and rpms tend to hang a little per shift. Long strokes between gears, but a $90 aftermarket short shifter should allievate this problem. Great gas mileage thus far ,worst MPG so far 28.79 mpg on the first tank (best 33.06 mpg last tank 1806 miles).
