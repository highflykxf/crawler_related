5,My first Toyota,A West ,08/29/2015,5,4,5,,,5,5,4,4,,,"After being in a wreck with my truck I decided to buy an car for fuel mileage. I looked at several vehicles before settling on the Corolla. Here are the reasons i choose it. First off I bought the Corolla S because of the factory body styling and you can not see the exhaust. Second the reviews on this site gave me a good feeling about the reliability of the vehicle. Third the safety of the vehicle, My wife tends to drive it every now and then with our daughter. The Toyota Corolla was the right choice. I have had it for two months now and love it.",,
4,The best economical option out there,rsucre ,01/28/2015,,,3,3,5,5,,4,4,5,3,"My first car was a 2007 Toyota Camry XLE V6 3.5L automatic. After driving it I fell in love with the Toyota brand. However, as a college student, owning a Camry got very expensive in regards to gasoline and maintenance. Therefore I decided to go with a more economic option and trade-in for a 2008 Corolla CE. I felt like it was the best decision possible. I needed a car that was both reliable and efficient with fuel, and the Corolla exceeds both of these requirements. ","This car has several features that I admire about it. First, this car gets an incredible 40MPG highway and anywhere from 30-32MPG City. At the most, I have to fill up every 2 weeks. I can also drive about 410 miles on a single tank (a mere 13 gallons), which makes this car ideal for road trips. Another feature I like in this vehicle is the manual transmission. Personally I believe, it makes driving a more engaging and fun experience and you feel that you are actually driving the car. Last, I like the quality I get for the economic price. Since I have owned this car ( about 2 years) I have not had a single problem. My car is currently at 94k and I believe I will drive it to 300,000k miles. ","Although I love my Corolla, there is always room for improvements. One feature I did not like was the stock speakers that came with the car. The first thing I did when I purchased this car was to replace the speakers. They sounded like crumbled paper, and when I replaced them I discovered that they were actually made of single layer cardboard paper. Another feature that I feel that could have been improved was the body style. The Corolla had the same body style from 2003-2008. Throughout that period, the corolla saw little changes. I feel that a change in the body style would have given it more appeal, such as an ""adventure version."" 

In all fairness, I got the CE version (basic). "

Almost caused an accident; very scary. Had to take it in for the recall; check engine light went on; occasionally would not start. Had a leaky brake; mechanic stated it was flaw in manufacturing. Have approx. 53,000 miles on the vehicle and the exhaust pipe rusted through right before the muffler. Other issues include: hard to see out the back window due to backseat head rests, archaic design, ice freezes in the trunk cover in the winter; ends up in the trunk every time its opened.In other words, I did not care that the car was ugly, just wanted something reliable.

I can park it just about anywhere.
The gas mileage is great but like all other cars, it doesn't get the manufacture mpg ratings (up to 40 mpg).
My mpg averages are between 31(C)-37(H).
The interior is impressive because they used a two tone color and different materials throughout, ie: cloth, vinyl, chrome and of course textured plastics.

I love the LE trim...the nice wood grain on the interior and the comfortable seats.  With 122 HP it isn't a sports car but it gets up and goes!  The only downside to this car is I purchased it at 35xxx miles and the drivetrain belt had already gone on it.  It was cracked and needed to be replaced -- fortunately under warranty.

I hate being afraid that I will not make it fast enough to merge.  The 1.8L engine is lagging and leaves a lot to be desired.  When the condenser went on my AC it was NOT covered by their extended warranty which was a huge let down and expense.  Overall this car gets me from A to B and starts up every morning.

I was told by the service dept. that it was a faulty sensor, and they didn't know if it would be covered by warranty. Then there has been the recalls, which happens with any manufacturer. However, today I brought my car in for my 30k mi. service and they discovered my water pump was leaking (covered by warranty) and my drivetrain belt needed to be replaced.

After all, that's all that this car is good for. After 2.5 years driving it after buying it brand new, I got bored with it and sick of hearing the engine strain to accelerate and pick up reasonable speed.

Smooth ride, great gas mileage (averaging combination city and highway about 35) and awesome looks.  I've heard the Camry is having a lot of quality control issues lately but the Corolla (at least this bodystyle) has been bulletproof. As for the engine...yes its a 1.8 4cylinder but I installed a k&N air filter and it greatly increased the power.  I think the acceleration is fine and you almost forget you're in a 4.  If you want anything faster, get a 3.5 V6 in the Camry!  The 1.8 is a great combination of gas mileage and performance...for those that don't know its the same engine Toyota puts in the Celica GT (2000-2005).

The looks...well, calling this car even remotely ""sporty"" does not work.

I commute 110 miles each day (mostly highways) and I have gotten as high as 41 mpg.  My average mileage ranges between 37 to 39 mpg.  Who needs an expensive hybrid with this kind of mileage.  The engine is willing and fairly quick from a stop light.  The five speed is fun and the ratios are well spaced.  The a/c works great and there is plenty or room for passengers and parcels.  Although the handling is not quite as sporty as my old Mazda Protege, it is a much quieter and smoother ride.  Overall, very impressed with the Corolla.  Is it perfect, no.

I like the gas mileage and it drives smoother than the Honda Civic we test drove.  I dislike the fact that the brakes make a loud ""popping noise"" when you take off and/or put it in reverse.  It's loud enough that ppl in the back seat and on the street will make comments about why a 2008 car would sound like that.  Have taken it to the dealership who says the brakes have ""floating"" parts on them & all 08s sound like that.  Next visit in, I heard someone else complaining of the same thing.

The mileage is great, but you have to adjust your driving habits to get the most from this car. I am averaging just over 35 mpg in combined city/highway driving. I love the look and the fact that the ""S"" model comes with all the looks without the premium price. The nit-picks: 1) there is no indicator for which gear you're in on the dash (you have to look down at the shifter), 2) the rotating knobs seem a little cheap when you turn them, and 3) the outside mirrors don't fold away like many others). Other than that, this is a great car.","I love the style, and the fuel economy. Keep the RPM below 3k and you will see what I mean. It is fully loaded with everything I wanted in a 'sporty' car.

Acceleration is very slow, but the car maintains the speed pretty well.  My fuel economy is about 30 mpg with 80/20 highway/city driving. Because of the awkward rear design, I find it hard to see what's in the back while parallel-parking.  The turning angles are too sharp for the car this size.

I constantly have to adjust the side view mirrors to match the seat height. The car gives me 28 mpg in town. It's hard to see the side of the car at turns. There should have been a turn signal built on the front side like 10"" behind the head light on both sides. It will be easier for other cars in the lanes next to Corolla to see.  Same signal should be on all four sides of the car.",Spacious with more leg room.,At turns the metal part that holds the front glass shield is always in the way.

Also, it is very easy to shift.  I really like the conservative styling (this is the last year for this style).","As everyone has said, side-curtain airbags and ABS brakes should be standard.  Needs a telescoping steering wheel. I find myself leaning forward to reach the radio controls."
4.5,Great Value,EJ ,11/21/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,4,4,5,4,This is a great value vehicle.  It will pay it off by itself eventually (I use it daily on my business operations).,Nothing really impressed me except the gas mileage.,Better safety features as standard equiped rather than options.
5,Yet another Corolla,H.Nieves ,11/12/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is our third Corolla. Wife had a 2003, daughter has a 2005. When my wife's HHR was totaled she wanted to return to a Corolla as long as it had side air bags. Driving my Jeep was a bit scary for her. We got the LE model with power windows, wooden like interior trim and cruise control. It sets the standard for all compact economy vehicles. Excellent mileage, smooth ride, roomy interior and a huge trunk. Perfect for city driving and for long trips for two adults and a maximum of two preteens. Well put together and indicative of Toyota's pursuit of quality even in an economy vehicle. A great bargain.   ","Fuel economy, smooth ride and built with quality.","Sits a bit too low. Do not travel bumpy dirt roads with it. Did it once damaging the wheel bearings of my prior Corolla, that's what my Jeep is for."
5,Great car for the money,tom ,10/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is a great car for the money.  I traded in my Durango for an LE specifically for gas mileage.  My first tank averaged about 37 miles per gallon.  The interior is roomy and comfortable.  It's pretty nice looking for an inexpensive car.  ,Gas milEage.  I'm going to save a bundle on gas.  Also the interior is really nice.,Aluminum wheels standard on the LE.
4.125,My thoughts about the Corolla,Jose ,10/22/2007,,,4,2,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"Gas mileage is great. Small size for easy city/tight spot parking, yet spacious inside. Has a luxurious feeling to it inside. I got the LE fully equipped: ABS, EBD, curtain airbags for rear, cruise control. Acceleration is a bit disappointing on highway, but once cruise speed is attained has no problem reaching 90 mph, and sounds and feels quite smooth.","ABS/EBD, side curtain airbags for rear (I have 2 young kids) doors closing sound like a luxury car.",Need auxiliary jack plus MP3 playback capability. No corolla trim has MP3 available! Outside look bland and simple (ie. boring). Seriously considering trading for Scion xB in spite of financial hit.
5,Boring looks? Try the S,Zang ,10/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"S type Corolla has a much more interesting look to it, for those who are knocking the ""plain"" look of the Corolla, the S package doesn't add much in price but adds a body kit and rear spoiler to jazz it up a bit.  Yes, it's still a Corolla, but it's much better looking in the S version.  For those griping about performance, it's either gas mileage or performance, not both.  Face the truth; you and I grabbed this car because it's cheap to buy, cheap to maintain, cheap to drive.  If it had a monster V8 in it and had tons of performance, we would have bought a Civic; we're not happy with 10 mpg. You DO however feel much sportier and more in control of engine horsepower with a stick.  Try it.","My S type has the power roof, which I like, the body kit and spoiler, which I like, and of course I've been sold on Toyota quality for most of my adult life.","Standard side airbags.  Of course this would have placed the pricepoint higher.  Telescoping steering column, it is a bit far-away feeling."
4.625,Bouncy Bouncy,magnolia ,10/02/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"Overall, a great car. The ride is bouncy on side streets at slower speeds. Our other car, a Focus, is also small, but has a smoother ride.","For a such a small car, the Corolla is quiet, gets very good gas mileage and is competent on the road. Its fun to drive. The manual transmission is easy to shift. The seats are very comfortable for us.","Needs a smoother ride, an auxiliary jack on the radio for an mp3 player (who plays CDs anymore) and a bit more headroom in the back. Plastic wheel covers need to hide the black rims underneath. From behind, shouldnt look like a tiny econobox."
4.75,Experience with my 2008 Corolla,cja ,09/20/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car gives a nice smooth ride for its size. Acceleration is smooth and the transmission shifts great. This car rides a bit high and the driver's seat is adjustable; all nice features. However, I find the steering wheel a bit too far away, making driving a little uncomfortable and the knee ends up too close to the console. I'm somewhat disappointed with the fuel economy (rated at 26/35) when my bigger accord of 1988 produced 30/34 mpg.","The sound of the doors closing rival those of expensive cars, acceleration and automatic transmission shifting is really smooth when compared to my 2001 civic. ","Brake pressure regulator mounted on firewall was somehow sprinkled with water and I noticed rust spots (on the brake lines in this area too!), even with 37 miles on the odometer. Toyota refused to answer my concerns and the local dealer said that it was normal. How disappointing!"
4.875,A Great Little Car,Hal Jones ,09/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"This car makes more sense than any I've driven in years. First tank of gas gave 40.5 MPG! Room for everything necessary. Cleanly styled, and enough horsepower to make the interstate driving more comfortable. I didn't buy it for racing, but I sure did for gas mileage, and boy did it deliver!","Clean styling, super gas mileage, great headlights, comfortable seating, quiet little sedan. It is a tight little package for an economy car, and a super buy.","Flatter folding rear seats. I added cruise control, and it works great, should be standard."
5,Best valued car for me,SureJuJu ,08/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Things I wanted in my car: fuel economy, reliability, good price, enough seating room and trunk space for my two teenage daughters.  My basic Corolla CE met all my requirements and more.  Only additions are an after market alarm/keyless entry system for $260, an Obus Forme seat cushion (for my back), and a free front dashboard cover from my dealer.  Everything is great with this car - very satisfied so far.  BTW, I still don't understand why people are complaining about the ""boring"" exterior and interior styling.  My Corolla looks like a solid car to me - none of those fancy, weird looking ""fun to drive"" features inside and out.","Electric mirrors, outside temperature gauge, lots of storage compartments everywhere.",Have a switch to turn off daytime running lights.
5,Great car!!,wake ,07/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My Toyota Corolla is an excellent car. It gets great gas mileage, is very reliable, and is actually somewhat peppy for having such a small motor (if i wanted a fast car I would not have bought a Corolla). This car  is excellent for people who want a car to get from work and back, or for a small family who want a reliable car at a decent price.","Well though out controls, reliability and gas mileage.",
3.75,2008 Toyota Corolla,Suddhatma Mukherjee  ,06/22/2007,,,3,3,3,5,,5,3,4,4,The Toyota Corolla is not a fast car but is powerful enough for daily city drives and occasional holiday outing. It is more of a touring car rather than a racer or a rally car. The steering is superb with fine cornering abilities. Only the power for engine is a small let down. City driven mileage is 9.86 kmpl but highway driven mileage is 11.0 kmpl. ,"Power steering, vvti engine, air conditioner, passenger space, brakes, (ABS and EBD).",This Corolla generation lacks the sporty nature of 89 coupes which it requires most. The styling is another issue where it needs vast development.
