5,2008 Acura TSX 6 - Speed,Lou Mich ,09/02/2016,5,5,4,,,5,4,5,5,,,"I bought the car about 3 months ago and it has exceeded my expectation. I read that it was considered slow, but that has not been my experience...any rev above 3k RPM will get the car moving and once you get to the 6k RPM the vtec kicking  is a joy to behold. The 6 speed manual transmission is one of the best I have driven with a precise and close gear box. The clutch is a little tricky but you should get a hang of it in a couple of days. The handling of the car is amazing, and getting off off rumps and driving in twists is really enjoyable, the car goes where you point it and has no body roll. Generally a great entry level luxury car with some sportiness..",,

Drives better much much then my brand new 2015 Honda accord. This TSX is made in Japan and the new Accord in Ohio, just goes to show the difference in quality. Excellent handling and performance. Its a real drivers car, quality interior not cheap plastics like the new accord. You feel you have the power of a V6 with that Vtec 4 cylinder. I have owned a BMW 3 series, A4, A6 and a C300. But this car is on par with all the other german rivals if not much better definitely then the 3 series e90 I had before  the TSX. It handles like a dream and corners just great, even though it is not RWD. It is very very tight on corners! I have driven this up the mountains and on bends and handles perfectly. The reliability is just great as it is a Honda. This engine is bullet proof, one of Hondas best engines. I have seen 250K on these cars and they still drive great. Great Sound system, HID lights and Very comfortable seats!This car is a hidden gem. You hardly see any on the roads, most people dont know about this brand and model that Honda has produced for its europe market but rebranded as Acura for the USA. If you can get a low mileage (100k) with service history BUY IT!! you wont be disappointed as they will go past 250k flawlessly . They Look great and modern and I got a lot of compliments too even though it was a 2008.",,

You have the feeling that you have a precision instrument in your hands. A feeling of tactile feedback from the steering wheel. The sound of the engine has a pleasant resonance.

The reviews kept pointing toward this car and I am very happy we purchased.  The lease ends in a couple months and we are torn between keeping this car and leasing the 2010 RDX.  It can't be beat for the price, if you consider quality, features and Luxury Brand.  Not the quickest car on the road, but still a lot of fun to drive and feels quicker than numbers indicate.  We have the black with parchment and wood interior, a great combo.  The MPG are decent if you drive normal, last tank was 26 MPG with 60/40 HWY/CITY.  I would highly recommend this car and the Honda products.","Look, quality of interior, fit & finish, Bluetooth, great handle and spirited VTECH engine","Nothing, maybe relocate oil filter for the handyman that changes his own to save $25"
4.75,I'm in love with my Acura TSX,elleaz ,05/08/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"This is my first Acura, and it was love at first sight. I built my Acura online, and the metallic cool light blue is the most beautiful color of all. This car is classy. It's pure BS about the engine being underpowered - I accelerate faster than anyone around me 100% of the time. Of course, you have to know how to hit the accelerator, and I've lived long enough to do that. There are a few minor things that are less than perfect. The location of controls on the steering wheel could be better. The door does not always stay open in the half-open position.  My biggest disappointment is the changes to the design in the 2009/10 models. They've managed to destroy a beautiful thing. ","It's fast, and it's fun! The handling is beautiful.","The 2008 styling was perfect. Go back to the 2008 design, idiots!  Bring back the male voice for the voice activated commands and navigation.

4.5,Not bad.,Toeser ,05/07/2010,,,4,5,5,4,,4,5,4,5,"Being retired, I now put far more miles on my bicycle and motorcycle than my car, so it made no sense for me to buy new.  After a lot of reading and looking, I narrowed my choices down to about 5 brands/models, and then just searched for the best one available.  I like the style, the gizmos, and the comfort.  However, the TSX is not nearly as quiet as an Accord I owned in the early 1990s.  I agree with others that the paint is cheap, and the radio just O.K.  I love the Nav system, but it does have some voice command brain farts.  Mileage isnt awesome (compared with newer cars), but decent - 26/30 for me.  It is one of the more comfortable cars I have owned.  Great seats.","Interior comfort, looks, good transmission, Nav system, nice range of driver/passenger doodads, fun to drive.","How much more would a good paint job cost?

4.5,Great with a few exceptions,Skip ,04/09/2010,,,5,5,5,4,,4,4,4,5,"I couldn't find another entry level luxury car that came even close to the TSX for features at the price.  I handles well, if a little slow off the line.  They need to equip it with better tires and a more reliable braking system.  The heating on a cold day takes a long time to come up to temperature. See suggested improvement section for comments on tires and brakes which are terrible.","Navigation system, Display and controls.  Very comfortable for a smaller car.","Equip it with tire that give some traction on wet roads.  The original Michelins had minimal tread, and minimal traction. A safety issue!

5,The Japanese Alfa Romeo Sedan,sportscarnut ,02/25/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The 2006-2008 TSX has perfect balance of performance, luxury, and economy.  My 2 previous cars were an M3 and M5 BMW.  I was honestly not expecting to like this car when I first drove it, but I love it.  It has the most balanced handling of any front drive car I have ever driven.  You can almost throttle steer it through a corner.  The engine revs like a Ferrari V8, and the car feels much faster than the numbers indicate. The 2006-2008 cars have a markedly improved performance due to a larger throttle body and intake system, and the updated front/rear fascia and rocker covers make it look substantially sportier.  All the controls are perfectly placed, and the fit-and-finish are outstanding.","Combination of stiff chassis / compliant suspension, rev-happy engine, fantastic shifter, excellent fuel economy (24 city / 32 highway), large trunk, impeccable build quality / reliability, high level of luxury for the money, great looks (2006-2008 models), minimal fancy electronics to break ","Having the option of buying an ""M"" version would be nice, why do car makers feel the need to have 3"" of gap between the fenders and wheels?, Acura needs to shed about 200 pounds and a few inches from the 2009-on models to bring them back to the perfection that is the 2006-2008 cars"

She loves the Nav, I think it isn't worth the $2k (especially now that we both have iPhones :)).  Navigation should have real time traffic and weather, like my iPhone or any other handheld GPS unit.  The only negative so far is the brakes.  They are terrible.  Okay, so they do stop the car, but they are weak and stopping distance is longer than expected.  Took some getting use to, to say the least!  The Bluetooth is cool, but limited.  People complain a lot that they can't hear us (and I'm a loud guy).  All in all, a great car for the price!  We are happy with it & would buy again.  Good (not great) MPG average 25 MPG in mixed driving.","Bluetooth and Nav (even with the limitations).  The fact that everything is standard: leather, sunroof, etc.  The only option was the Nav.  Acura support: We had a tear in our leather seat hidden by the seat belt receptacle.

The 6 speed manual was definitely the way to go. It's more fun than the auto and I get great mileage - 34 on the hwy, 27 commuting. So far the winter handling with Blizzak snow has been excellent.

Our only issues were little things like the fact that the front doors don't stay open well when one is getting in and out out the car.  And I didn't like the position of the door lock on the sill where one might rest their arm.   The safety features are what I liked best as my wife was able to walk away with a bruised knee from an accident where someone hit her head-on at 40 mph while she was stationary.  We are replacing our now totaled TSX with an exact duplicate.

5,Solid Performance Sedan,Alex ,08/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just purchased this car.  A used 08 with 20K on the odometer.  What sold me was the incredible build quality, handling, comfort and the performance of the 2.4L VTEC engine.  This is a fantastic sport/luxury sedan.  Clean lines and no ""fast and furious"" body work.  I'm used to an AWD sedan so I'm a little concerned about this car's bad weather handling with the Michelin Pilots.  Have to wait and see.  So far in the dry heat and heavy thunderstorms of summer, it's handled very well.  The car inspires you to test it's limits.  The VTEC is very eager to rev and run.","This car has it all.  Hard to pick one feature.  All are represented equally well (engine, handling, comfort, appearance).",Addressed on the 2009 model.
4.875,The Almost Perfect Car,Scundo ,07/30/2009,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I know there are a lot of complaints about the low end torque.  Let's put things in perspective though.  It's a 2.4L 4 cylinder putting out 205 naturally aspirated horsepower. It does it in an extremely smooth manor too.  Isn't that how a sport luxury sedan engine should perform?  After driving everything from fire-breathing pushrod v8's to boxer 4's all I can say is this engine is a jewel.  Honda/Acura builds the best 4 cylinders.  Period.  Smooth, powerful, economical.  The gearing on the 5 speed auto is excellent.  The interior is flawless.  Everything where it should be and it's very comfortable.  Awesome handling.  Steering is perfectly weighted.  Drive by wire throttle is very slick.","Engine, suspension, interior, exterior.  In that order.  Very refined, mature looking sedan.  Not trendy or ""boy racer"" looking.

The leather bucket seats are comfortable for me (I'm 5'4)and there is plenty of room inside. Driving feels extremely smooth and breaking is great. This is my first car and I'm scared to try a new one b/c I might be disappointed. I prefer the '08 model over the '09 simply b/c the exterior look can't be beat.

I sold an RL to get the TSX. I wanted something with better mileage and sportier look and feel. I am very happy with the TSX. It is smooth and stiff in the right places and times. The VTEC really hums when you crank up the RPM's. I am getting pretty good mileage too. ,Memory seats are always nice. The bluetooth phone is nice also.

Beautiful black exterior with tan leather seats and wood grained interior; rear spoiler, loaded but without the navigation system.  Unfortunately, the dash had a rattle from day one.  After 6 trips (and counting) the dealership has not been able to resolve the rattle, and it continues to be worse and never stops - not something I expected from a Honda product.  Previously I drove Ford Explorers, Mercedes C230 and Mercedes SLK 320.  ",All the 'extra's were standard features in the car. Body style and appearance. XM radio is great!  Car got 36 MPG on highway at 70 MPH.,"Sound system is poor, flat and weak. Better gas mileage in town.  Location of heated seat buttons need to be relocated-moved away from easy access.

Took it on 3 long trips which were about 2400 miles and the fuel economy on the highway was 34 mpg with premium fuel and city averages around 27 mpg.

My next car was going to be a 06-07 WRX, however I wasn't ready to buy one in 06 and I couldn't land a good deal on an 07. I test drove the 6-speed TSX and was sold, offers luxury and refinement ALONG WITH great looks and sporty handling.

It's been an early winter so far, & the car has generally been great in the snow (this was my main reason for contemplating the AWD models like A4).","The trunk is much larger than I thought it would be. The bluetooth hands-free is wonderful. I got a black one with a spoiler (& black leather), & it looks really sharp.","Last wk I tried entering a parking garage in downtown Chicago, but couldn't drive up the very steep ramp (it stopped about halfway).

The handling has been great even on snowy roads.  All I hope for now is just a tad bit more thrust, say an additional 75 horses would be nice.  I have had a few issues with the hands free but over all love the car, and the deal I got made me felt I stole it.","Exterior design was icing on the cake along with the HID lights.  Love the carbon gray color, gives it a sophisticated look, without the cost.","Give it the horsepower to match the design and feel of the car or Type S it, for it's more the sport's model.

This was the only Japanese car that had a German ""feel"" to it, but with none of the reliability issues that have plagued my German car ownership experience. German cars, when not in the shop, are still the benchmark for interior design and driver handling, but the TSX comes so close that it won me over from selecting a Jetta GLI. The driving feel is very Euro, with stiff steering, taught suspension, and would perform very well on the autobahn as it is the Euro Accord. I'm looking forward to a long trouble free ownership. ","Euro look, very nice cockpit layout, interior materials high quality, slick 6 speed, smooth revving engine, very well equipped for the price, a driver's car.","Sunroof switch in the wrong place, temp controls too small / fussy, in dash CD cannot play MP3, I-Vtec kicks in at 6000 RPM..would be nice to activate at 4500 - 5000 rpm."

4.5,College Toy,phawk590 ,07/09/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Though I miss it greatly, I traded in my Tahoe z71 due to gas prices. As a serious car buff i searched long and hard for a good car to purchase that i could take to college. Factors included attractiveness, performance, gas mileage, comfort, resale value, MSRP, and expected yearly cost including gas. The TSX has filled its position nicely, performing and driving better than my girlfriend's 2009 model. My notes are as follows; allow a break in period as it is required to get to peak performance, 65-70 on a flat trip you will get well over 30 mpg, the car does turn heads, the leather on the seats creases easily, the kick plates will chip quickly, and it is well worth it to add a cold air intake.","The navigation in the TSX, as in most Acuras, is superb. The exhaust note, for those to whom it matters, is a nice purr and evidence of the small but mighty performance tuned 2.4L engine. And for a college student the great trunk space is a major plus. ","The transmission is slow to down shift especially under moderate acceleration. To me though, the greatest downfall is the lack of a factory turbo option on the TSX, and something still not available on the 2009 model. On a minor note, the sunroof button should perhaps be relocated as it is awkward."
4.75,A nice step up after owning 2 Accords,Andrew ,07/02/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,4,5,5,5,"After a 92 and 98 Accord, I decided to upgrade to the Acura TSX.  So far after almost 6 months I am not disappointed.  This car is fun to drive and sporty, yet still gets awesome mileage (I have gotten mid 30s on pure highway).  Commuting mileage is OK and can get mid 20s.  For the price you get so many features found in many higher level models.  Audio is OK, but not the car's high point.  However almost all the features can be found on the new 8th gen Accord (minus HID headlights and bluetooth phone), in a much bigger but more powerful car.   Above all, this car is a Honda.  Dependable, great resale value, laundry list of standard features. ","Bluetooth hands free phone, navigation system easy to use, heated/memory seats, great mileage, MID/speedo cluster is intuitive and looks sharp.  Controls are easy to use.  Great value at this price point.","The biggest gripe is that it uses premium gas to achieve its great mileage.  Other minor gripes, the seats are just OK, the sound system is sorely outdated and more suitable for a civic not an entry-level luxury car.  Honda paint is very cheap and chips very easily.  Not much torque in the midrange"
4.25,Little motor that could,TCC0247 ,06/29/2008,,,5,4,5,4,,4,4,4,4,"The TSX is a study in less being more.  It may only have 205-hp and a 4-cylinder, but the power delivery is so smooth and the revs come so quickly that it feels quick none the less.  It'll never win you pink slips, but it will certainly move you on the back roads.  It's not RWD, but it still feels supple and balanced.  Steering is too heavy for the Camry crowd, but enthusiasts will appreciate the extra weight and feel.  The 6-speed and clutch are so slick and easy to use that the car is easy to wring out when the desire arises (or every time you drive it).  The interior build quality is excellent, though the sound system is flat.  Never liked Hondas before; the TSX's Euro-breeding fixed that","Clearly designed and built for Europe.  Taut and compact, it moves gracefully.  Exterior is simple, but classic and handsome.  Interior is outstanding.  Gearbox is fantastic.  Engine revs freely, quickly and smoothly.  4-cylinder fuel mileage doesn't hurt either.  Standard features will drop jaws.","Sound system is pretty flat and anemic for a luxury car.  Those seeking the killer torque of the Infiniti or BMW's twin-turbo engine will find the thrust lacking, but for everyone else the TSX's smooth grace will make you question the need for that kind of power.

This does drop to 22-25 with mixed highway/city driving in dallas but I have very little to complain about with this car for the cost.,"The navigation system is great and by far the best when compared to Lexus, BMW, Infiniti and Toyota.  It is very user friendly and has a much large data base than the competitors.  The lumbar back support in the front seat is also better than other cars with the exception of a BMW.",Navigation screen can be hard to see in the sun.  The back seat is not as comfortable as the front seat although I expect this with a smaller car.  Better city gas mileage would be nice.  I'm obviously being very picky on car in this price range.

This is a very solid sports car feel, in a small sedan, still with ample room for 4 people.  Having had Hondas since 1986, this was a major step up for me, and the car is solid, planted and fun to drive.  Too bad that it has to use premium gas, buy that's the way Honda gets 205 HP out of the 2.4L four cylinder.

The car is solid and I maybe just becoming a Honda guy.  The value here is way more than you see with the European cars, so I don't think I'll be buying another BMW.  Plus the future maintenance costs with this car are much lower than BMWs.","The navigation is cool (wife talked me into that one), but I wish it had the traffic advisory (like the '09 does). My favorite feature is just the overall value.  You get leather, sunroof, nav, bluetooth, etc. AMAZING!","The brakes are weak!  Especially compared to my BMW.  Also, I think they could provide better fuel economy out of a 4-cylinder.

I decided on a brand new Acura TSX for reliability, low maintenance and other factors. It has nice interior, every option standard for a lot less.  It handles great in the corners, stops swiftly, has good initial pickup, little slow from jumping from 70mph to 90mph. I have started to really like this car now.

There is no other model out there with the same features and quallity for the price (aroung 30k).  The 08 car has a lot more bells and whistles than the 04 version and I love it.  The biggest downside to this car is the underpowered engine.  I had a manual last time and went with the automatic this time... big mistake.

This is a great car for those $3.50+ per gal. fill-ups without feeling like you are stuck with a boring ride. It handles great in the corners, stops swiftly, hauls tail on the freeway and still gets my blood pumping. I love this car, but when they get a V-6 or turbo, I'm soooo there!

I spent less than 30 minutes at the dealership to get a feel for the real car.  After a couple of days of haggling my TSX was shipped from Lexington.  This is about the 10th Honda/Acura that I have owned and the TSX has the least peppiest motor of them all.  My salesperson described the TSX as an Accord on steroids and I would have to say that the statement is accurate.  Acceleration is boring but the rest of the car fits me perfectly.  Not sure if they changed the stock stereo system in 2008 but my stereo sounds great.  It works great with my iPod.,I like the voice recognition software.  The iPod hookup is a plus.  I got a rear deck spoiler and I think it helps with the overall appearance of the car.  I think Acura/Honda paints a nice red car.,Crazy that this car only gets 20 MPG in the city being that it is horribly underpowered.  I would have paid to be able to type S my TSX.

I was looking at the Honda Accord, Camry SE, and the VW Jetta in addition to the 2008 TSX. I test drove all the above and hands down the TSX drove the best. It was the fastest and the best handling. Besides driving excellent, this car has all the extras (standard) that you would want. My favorites are the Bluetooth and auxiliary input for your iPod. Also, I am not sure what people expect out a stock radio but the TSXs radio is great. I got the car in black and tinted the windows and this baby looks great.

To me, the stereo is great. The power is more than adequate and it is just an over all excellent value. For those who may be hesitant, it is almost impossible to not like this car. It may not be your dream ride, but is an excellent compromise.","Awesome 6-speed shift action, overall value, standard features.","Summer tires. Though it would affect performance, the gearing is a little short. The 2.3 turbo and SH-AWD from the RDX would make this an outstanding car.

I've driven 2,000+ miles since November purchase and have found this to be a great car.

Not the case and in fact I don't notice much of a differnce outside of not have the turbo kick-in at 6000 rpms.  I also thought the body was somewhat plain at first, but have since grown to love it.  This is a great car for anyone in the entry level luxury sedan market.","The TSX is not an Accord with a $10k ""A"" on the front; navigation is great; price to performance ratio when compared to other luxury sedans in its price range; the body and style of the car; and the interior design.
