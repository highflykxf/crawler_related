I think you can use the word ""Lemon"" in this case and it sounds like the same for others posting their comments here as well... if this is what the GMC Acadia is like since the Outlook and the Acadia are similar in parts, service , etc. , I am going to steer away from GMC!!",,

I really like the design of this vehicle inside and out. My main complaint is that it has major problem after major problem. The only good thing is that so far everything has been under warranty. The first thing to go was the rack and pinion at 30,000 miles. At around 35,000 miles the right strut started leaking and had to be replaced. It started leaking again at 60,000 miles, I dont know if its bad luck for me or a design flaw. The next thing to go was the water pump at 50,000. Finally at 68,000 miles the transmission went. Thankfully it was still under warranty (with only two months to spare) and the dealership had to replace 3rd, 5th and reverse gears. Overall this has been the most unreliable vehicle I have ever owned. I would never recommend this vehicle to anybody. All owners appear to have the same main problems and I cant believe General Motors doesnt offer some type of buyback program as they did for the Vue. ",,

Curious if it gets even better with top quality tires.  Back of the seat liners need better upholstery. Cup holders should have slots for mug handles, head rest position should be adjustable like BMW.","Good base radio speakers, XM radio, front visibility, ride quality, exterior styling front. Seat design. Engine low noise - read an article on its design, very impressed. Lambda platform. Six speed transmission, it is fine, this is not a rocket. Just accelerate slowly, your mileage will improve.","Front dash plastic feel. Third window wrap around look, Acadia window looks better.Bottom part/plate under front bumper? Must cause air drag? What is the purpose? Aluminum bumper wrap around like Vue? Roof rack sleeker less plastic? Little more silver on body side. 09 engine sound quieter than 08"

We immediately left southern Oregon to Boise then Utah, Wyoming, Colorado and so on all the way to Louisiana. We never reset the trip meter the entire trip just filled it up.

She saw the Acadia when it came out, and fell in love, but the Saturn is the best bang for the buck in the Lambda platform. We were able to buy a well- epuipped Outlook for less than base Acadia money. We found the Enclave(the Traverse would also) to be much harder to see out of because of the ramped up rear side window and small back glass. The Outlook has the 2nd best-looking interior after only the Enclave. It is averaging a true 18.9 mpg, which is better than I expected. It is very smooth, has a quiet ride, with very decent power for a 4600# car. I never thought I'd buy a Saturn, but after year 1, I'm glad we did",Great styling and beautiful interior. I especially love the XM radio and she loves the folding rear seats and storage.

I am 6' 1"" and my 13 year old son is well on his way there. With the second row captains chairs, he and I can comfortably and easily get into the third row seat, far easier than any other vehicle we tried.   A great surpise:  After changing my flat tire (which was quite easy) I found that Saturn had put a large plastic bag in a storage area so that the dirty damaged tire could be stored in the back so as not to make any mess! Wow! Very nice touch!  ",Accessibility of third row seat. Ease of folding down rear seats so as to create more storage space.

(loved my two used Suburbans I had previously) Poor gas mileage. Get 12 in town averaging 15 mph/19 on the highway 53 mph. Took it in twice- Mechanic says I'm getting 16/22. It broke down out of state. Had to have computer replaced at 2000 miles. The passenger seat bottom had to be put back on. Can't get used to the small window in the rear hatch. Can't see distance to back up/park. Frustrating. Now I am anxious about going far from home for fear it will break down again. Defeated the whole purpose of a new car! ,"I do like the style, color.

4.375,Poor gas mileage!,crasberry ,12/29/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,2,5,I realized in the 1st tank of gas that I wasn't getting the MPG that Saturn told me I would get. The vehicle is rated at 16 MPG city but we struggle to get 12. It would be different if the vehicle was driven hard but it's driven very slow in a fairly small town that you don't drive over 35 MPH. I've had the vehicle back to 2 Saturn dealerships 4 times and they can't seem to figure out why it gets the poor mileage. The last Saturn dealer told me they drove it and got over 16 MPG. I offered to ride with them to verify their claim and they refused. My wife loves the vehicle but if I knew it was going to get 12 MPG I would have bought another vehicle with a V-8 engine.,The vehicle drives great and has plenty of room for my grandkids.,Better gas mileage!

The driver and passenger feel like they are in a luxury car, while the kids feel like they are in a roomy minivan-like environment, with a DVD player, 110V outlet for the x-box, and easy in and out due to the lower than most SUV's ground clearance. Our 3 year old can easily get in and out himself. Overall, it's a fantastic car that is fun to drive yet has all the features that a busy family is looking for.","Interior styling, DVD player, navigation, back-up camera.","None, unless it could get 50 mpg.

4.75,Saturn XR AWD,Chris ,07/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,Recently purchased the Saturn Outlook XR AWD. Special ordered the Ocean Mist with Gray leather interior. Drives smoothly and very comfortable and spacious for family of five. Looked at Enclave and Acadia as well and with same options Saturn is a better deal dollar for dollar. We have the same options as the Acadia SLT-2 for $1500 less. ,With kids a must is the captain chairs to easily get to the third row. Also recommend the DVD headrests compared to the flip down which would block rear view when driving. Option only $400 more and you get two DVD players and can play two seperate movies for those long trips. ,"Need a more powerful engine like the one in the Tahoe or Yukon at least 300 plus horsepower. Also fuel economy could definetely improve. Overall, an excellent vehicle for the family looking to get out of the minivan. "
4.875,Love it,sjgray8 ,07/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We needed a car that could carry 6 kids plus stuff and tow a boat and we didn't want a monster SUV. The Outlook is exactly what we needed.

I saw the Outlook in a magazine and went to see it for myself. My wife wanted another Pilot. I wanted a larger Tahoe/SUV. (Glad we didn't go there now!)  After the first year we can honestly say, it is the best automobile we have ever owned!  But why would you want to pay more for the GMC/Buick sibling when they are made side by side in the same plant but are thousands more because of the name plate?  I have suggested this SUV to many friends and all have six have purchased and all have great things to say.","Very comfortable. Smooth, quiet ride and a joy to drive  The gas mileage is better than expected. We get 20+ around town and close to 28 on the highway. Little less in the mountains. If you need the room but don't want to pay your mortgage in gas this is it!  At 4.00/gallon it costs $80 to fill up.",The only thing I would change is the gear ratios on the lower gears. Saturn fixed this on the '08 model as it had a little drag/hesitation off the line but the dealer did do a computer upgrade when we took it in for our first service which helped.

We had to order our Saturn AWD with a 8 week delay, but it was worth it!  I drive on some awful dirt roads down in Mexico and the Outlook handles very well. I do notice some reduced power going uphill, but does not affect the overall enjoyment of the ride. I'm getting 16 mph around town, which is what they advertise. I love having all the interior room and my 6' son has room to spread out in the 2nd row bench seat.  And our three dogs enjoy all the room in the spacious cargo area.

Fortunately, our checkbook steered us to the Outlook!  Much more affordable, even with leather seats and DVD. Enclave had softer ride, but lots of pricy ""extras"" that we really didn't need anyway. Acadia was in-between priced, but maybe even more truck-like. Our FWD Outlook has good MPG 22HWY and 20 mixed without much break-in yet. Still has good performance and power, quiet ride, transmission shifts well (not too picky here).  ","The kids love the 2nd row bench, and there's still room for dogs behind the 3rd row. And good leg room for me at 6'2"". Rear floor storage unit removable, rear seats unbolt with wrenches if needed for lots of room.  ","Blue tooth compatibility, maybe a Hybrid engine in the future.

The Outlook overall is just an amazing tour de force of engineering, comfort, ergonomics, class and quality. The main reason I like this car is because it rides like an enlarged car not a modified pickup truck like most other sport utes out there. A V8 would be nice but not required.",The driving position is one of complete command of the road and one of ultimate safety.  The ride is also 100% American which anyone that understands a good ride will relate to (not like a Toyota cheap truck feel). The internal space is amazing for families and growing families!,"Bundle less of the desireable features in such expensive option packages (i.e. be able to order power liftgate, leather seats and auto climate in a checklist type package).

A remarkable amount of techno-goodies (hint:  the Saturn is a much better value the way it is equipped than an Arcadia or Enclave).  Won't win any prize for looks, but not bad, either.

We have decided to use the exchange option that Saturn offers. With less than 1300 miles the car has developed camshaft problems, and a noise from the rear end every time we turn a corner. This 275 hp engine is not very strong when driving up hills. Its been in the shop three times in three weeks. If the exchange vehicle is not any better, we will probably never purchase another Saturn. ","Body style, beautiful paint. Love the heated seats",Fix the low power complaints. Do a better job of quality control before the vehicle leaves the factory.
4.875,Very pleased with this purchase,Jeff Hill ,03/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We owned a 2002 Windstar van. We wanted something with seating for 7 and bucket seats in the middle row.  Looked at the Acadia and found out about the Saturn. We love this car. My wife wanted to stick out the old van but has come to love this car.  It has good performance for a V-6, the gas mileage is decent, 16 in town, 19- 21 on the highway. I think to get better mileage, you would have to sacrifice performance and it has a nice blend of both.  It has ample legroom for all of us. We love the XM radio and also the OnStar.  We love the way the Outlook looks on the outside. My wife particularly enjoys the radio controls on the steering wheel and she loves the heated seats",Really like the dual sun roofs and also the luggage carrier we bought extra.,A little difficult to see to the sides and rear on the interstate.
4.5,2008 Saturn Outlook XR 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cy,Best ever! ,03/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,1,5,"The best and most comfortable, quiet car I have ever owned. We drive to Fl over 1500 miles, and I usually spend about eight hours behind the wheel! With this car I feel as though I could keep on driving all day and night. My only gripe is the gas mileage. I am hoping as I drive it more, that it gets better.","The back up alarm, only wish that they had one for the front!",The gas mileage!
4.75,Awesome!,BIG PAPPI ,03/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I love my Outlook. I just took it to Montana from Colorado hauling a trailer. It did OK, a little sluggish in the wind, gas mileage suffered but very comfortable. I drove the entire 1800 miles there and back. XM radio came in handy. Looks great inside and out. I finally got the car other people look at going down the road.","XM built in, OnStar very handy, smooth and comfortable to drive.",Power increase or improved gas mileage. Either would work for me.
4.875,Wonderful!,susan ,03/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I absolutely love this vehicle. I traded in a 2000 Ford Explorer and I couldn't be happier. I was looking at the Acadia as well, but the Saturn was almost identical for a lower sales price, so it was a no brainer.  It rides quite smoothly, and the 2nd row captain's chairs work nicely for my children. I'm getting about the same mileage per gallon on the Outlook as I did the Explorer. The remote start has come in handy on the cold mornings we've had recently. The dual sunroofs are my favorite option on the car. My one small complaint is that I wish the moon roof retracted into the roof completely and that the vents did not automatically come on when it is opened.","Dual sunroofs, XM radio, remote start.",Disable the auto vent feature and allow complete retraction of the moonroof.
4.875,The boys mom,mom of 3 boys ,02/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love my Saturn Outlook! Never owned a Saturn before and I will own more!  It out performs any other car I have had on the snow and ice----which I have had a lot of opportunity to test with this crazy winter. I previous owned 2 Ford Explorers, a Ford Freestyle and a Ford Expedition.  I went back to Ford when my Freestyle Lease was up---they tried to sell me a KIA--yuck. I bought the Saturn and I am so happy with it....it is roomier than the Explorer and the Freestyle. Although less comfortable seats than the Freestyle. The anti lock brakes and traction control have made it easy to get around while I watch other cars sliding all over in the crazy icy- snowy weather we have had.",Traction control is amazing! Love the beautiful red color and the styling!  ,The sound in the standard radio-cd player-not good. Improve speakers and placement of speakers. I wish that it had a smaller rear glass hatch. The large liftgate & effort it takes to open/close is unnecessary when putting in a single item. 
5,2008 Outlook Beats Buck and Arcadia,Don G ,02/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Evene before we purchased our 2008 Outlook XR AWD we first saw it at the Maine Mall. Now that we have poruchased we made the right choice this is a great crossover SUV. It meets our needs and we do a number of trips to Massachusetts. We enjoy everyhting about the Outlook,We love the sound system and the saftey features. Driving the Oulook is pure pleasure.,The only sugesstion we have right now is that they need to add a CD holder inside the the compartment under the front console.
4.625,If not for the fuel economy and the snow,Marco2068 ,02/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"We bought this car for the advertized fuel economy and to buy American. I alway buy AWD, but thought FWD would be fine and thought mild increase in fuel economy would be good. Wrong!This car can't get out of it's own way in the snow. It's so heavy in the rear there is no weight on the front tires. Forget about pulling onto a street after a snowstorm. The MPG is 15.5 at best. You can get near the 24 on the highway if you don't exceed 65 MPH. All in all, 15.5 is not 16-24 that they advertize.  I am a sad consumer when 2 of the three reasons I bought it were a fraud.","Great ride, nice amenities, comfortable seats, rearview camera and power liftgate are great. The Navigation system is top notch. Great space for the family.",Better fuel economy and and don't sell the FWD in the Northeast without a warning.
4.625,I am in love with my Outlook,Bar10Jen ,02/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,3,5,"I love everything about my XR.  It is sweet to look at, it is even sweeter to drive.  The sunroof and moonroof combination are a dream.  Navigation system rocks.  The auto-start is great with the heated seats being fired up when it is cold and the a/c being blasted when it is hot.  Remote opening of the back hatch is very handy, pop it then pick up what you are loading and load it with ease.  Captain seats in the 2nd row is a great idea, I tote a lot of stuff and people.  I have put over 10,000 miles on it since October and I love road trips in it.  I have tried out every channel on my XM and I love the fact that the radio downloads local radio stations so I don't have to search the airways.","The seat comfort,ride,exterior pizzaz, OnStar, XM, navigation system, the mobility of all the seats, auto start, remote hatch opening, the size and it is a Saturn which is now my favorite Company. ","If the gas mileage could be improved that woud be great, however I think it is pretty close to perfect in an over all sense.  No complaints after 10,000 plus miles!"
4.875,Best SUV Ever!,dawn143 ,02/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This is the best car I have ever owned and its a Saturn!  I just came out of a loaded 2006 Range Rover HSE and I would have never even thought about a Saturn Outlook XR AWD but after test driving it, I fell in love with everything about it.  It is so roomy inside, the styling is very up to date and it drives with so little effort.  It doesn't look big from the outside, the profile is very low but don't let that deceive you, inside is spacious with room for 7.  Its a little sluggish off the line but if you downshift you make up for that.  My only complaint are the doors, they tend to close on their own after opening them, tough with kids but you over look it.  A must buy!","Roomy seats, captain seats in the back, power lift gage, steering wheel controls, remote start, wood grain finish on the dash, stitching details on the leather, leg room in the front and back.","The transmission needs a little more tweaking, it downshifts too soon. The doors need to stay open, redesign the hinge that keeps them open."
3.875,Disappointment in Fuel Economy,Dan ,02/13/2008,,,5,5,4,4,,3,5,1,4,"I recently purchased my Outlook in. I thought I was ahead of the game by purchasing an Outlook instead of the Toyota Sienna. My number one reason for purchasing the Outlook was the advertised fuel economy. I thought it was too good to be true and I was right. I have exactly 2,596 miles on the vehicle. I use the cruise control religously on the freeway with just myself in the vehicle going at the speed of 65mph and I can never get better than 20mpg. I also had the time to test the outlook driving in the city until I had to get gas with just myself in the vehicle at all times and the best mileage I got was 13 mpg. I am so unhappy. Next time I will rent a car before I purchase. ",OnStar. Great leg room in the third row for real adults. Drives like a sedan. Second moon roof. Everything is computerized and is controlled by the driver. ,Needs better gas mileage! Transmission is slow when acelleration of power is needed. 
4.75,Large SUV that we really needed,Vigla ,02/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I have to say I was upset that GM gave up on minivans.  Their latest batch were pathetically ugly and I was looking forward to them replacing them.  Then we were told no more minivans from GM.  They were being replaced by the Outlook, Acadia, and Enclave.  Not only that, but the price on these goes up 5K over the price of a minivan!  Reluctantly, I went to check out the Outlook and Acadia and I was plesantly surprised by the quality and design.  My wife liked them very much too.  Since we have 3 kids under 4 years old we needed the room, so I bit the bullet and bought the Outlook XE.  I don't regret my decision at all.","Ride and handling are great!  Looks are nice too, we got midnight blue.  I know gas mileage will improve over time because it takes a while for the car's computer to get used to the driver's habits and shift the way you like.  I know I've seen comments complaining about the mileage.",I have the 8 seat version.  Putting 3 car seats into it is going to be tricky because we need access to the 3rd row and I don't want to have to remove the car seats anytime someone wants to sit in the back.  I'll have to figure that one out.  
4.75,"Yes, It's Really a Saturn!",tabjaxx ,02/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"Test drove GMC Acadia, Mazda CX-9, Chrysler Pacifica, bought a 2008 Outlook XR FWD. The Acadia didn't ride as nice as the Outlook and had a few rattles to it. One practically melts into the Outlook's leather seats. Nice leg room in 2nd row. The ride is smooth, but can be rather stiff over bumps. It is quiet--you can hardly tell the engine is running; road noise is minimal. The interior is handsomely designed and the amber lighting over the front seat console is a nice touch. Impressive fit and finish. Engine power is adequate, although it is not the quickest out of the gate. Transmission is smooth but is hesitant to downshift. Not bad gas mileage (18 cty, 21 hwy). Nice vehicle.  Good job GM!","Nice exterior styling, XM radio and OnStar, power liftgate, remote start, variable effort power steering, HID headlamps, rear parking sensors, steering wheel audio controls, 2nd row passenger leg room, ample cargo area.","Driver and passenger side mirrors could be larger, increase engine size or adjust transmission for a little more pickup (although I will sacrifice some performance for what I consider decent gas mileage for a crossover this size), larger and more conveniently placed driver control buttons."
4.75,Poor remote start,rfrieden ,01/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"We've had the Outlook for less than one month. I love driving it! (I traded in a minivan.) I had to have brake and windshield wiper fluid added already but I think it is because the levels weren't checked when I bought the SUV. It is fun to zip around in and feels so much sportier than my minivan. No longer a minivan driver, forever a soccer mom!","Love the heated wiper fluid! Love the spaciousness (2 adults,2 teenage boys and a daughter fit comfortably). I really like OnStar, XM radio, & the automatic tailgate. It drives very smooth.","I am extremely dissapointed in the auto start. I had one installed on my last two vehicles and they were much better. I may as well get in the SUV by the time I get close enough to start it. A big sluggish especially on hills, not the best gas mileage (didn't expect it)& little loader than I wanted"
5,Great road car,DJW ,01/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Just made a 2500 mile trip and it was a pleasure to drive. I averaged 22MPG for the whole trip and it didn't tire my 68 year old body.

This is exactly what I wanted.  My Outlook has just about everything except the Nav system and the dvd but this is why I opted not to get those...since I have OnStar I figured I would use that if I needed help with directions. Why pay for OnStar if you aren't going to use it?  Also, I didn't really like having a screen come down in my sight line from the ceiling so I opted for a portable dvd with wireless headphones which turned out to be a good decision as I can bring it on airplanes too. The only dislike is the low city mpg 15.6 (hwy mpg is fine, 23+)",Auto liftgate in the back is huge! Ease of moving seats up and down. Lots of room. Sporty exterior look,Better mpg 
5,I love this SUV,Chris ,01/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Ive had this SUV for a little over 3 weeks and so far it's been exceptional. No concerns here.

5,Love It!!,Outlook Owner ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Saturn really got it right this time! This vehicle doesn't just look good- it rides sooo smooth (better than the Acadia), has a lot of luxury features, and has lots of room (we have two small children and can actually walk around their carseats!).  Gas mileage is great for a large SUV- I get about 17 city, 20-21 highway.  I love the power liftgate, auto start, and the dual sunroofs are impressive looking.

Some of the buttons are rather small. Plenty of space in all three rows. I have FWD and that is sufficient in Norther New York with snowy conditions..I feel extremely safe as we have driven in snow, ice, and freezing rain conditions.","The power and gas mileage are not as reported and I am so disapponited as I feel environmentally this was the wrong car to purchase, I feel guilty driving this gas hog.

We've owned a Volvo for many years and looked at the XC90 first. The drive and room of the Outlook made far surpassed the Volvo. Drove a the big Toyota SUV and a Yukon- GM got it right with this crossover.  This summer, a 1200 mile family road trip was the most enjoyable car ride in memory. Kids were happy with room, headphones, and plugs for games. Seats were comfortable, and we averaged about 20/gallon. I was hoping for a little better gas mileage (EPA states 24 hwy), but other than that, no complaints.","Roomy interior, attractive styling, OnStar reports",

I love it. I have the captains chairs in the back and I would never have one without them. My insurance went down $300 a year because of all the safety features. My husband is 6'2"" and he has plenty of room. I have been getting so many compliments on the style of it. I love the OnStar, XM radio, and DVD player.

My wife and me, we were very impressed from the beginning.  We didn't know which one to choose between the Acadia and the Outlook, we decided for the outlook because it has more of a luxury type inside.  It's a lot of fun and comfort to drive it.

We recently went on a 1000 mile trip and it was the easiest ride I have ever undertaken.  he fit and finish is top notch (way better than my 2007 VW Passat Wagon) and I really like the exterior and interior design of the vehicle.
