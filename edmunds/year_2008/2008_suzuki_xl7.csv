My kids can control their heat/air from the back seat & the vents are on the roof so they dnt play with them,they stay in the position i put them in. I like the rear wiper blade,nice to have in a 3d row to make it easier to see in snow/rain. There is a charger port in backseat as well,comes in handy for kids & their electronics. Alot of Space when putting dwn the seats. Back hatch opens very nice but i had one problem with it slowly shutting itself only happened one time. I bought my Suzuki used & over 5 yrs old but have read that even a few yrs newer have the same issues..Locks/Fenders/Door Handle/Sensors. So it must be a common problem and i wldnt purchase this vehicle for any more than half of the price its worth bc of the problems but i do recommend buying it if its at a low cost or reduced price,bc it seems to have no major issues and is a nice family vehicle when all the little things aren't going wrong.

It seats seven adults, though the rear seat should be reserved for smaller folks or kids. I've had three teenage girls ride comfortably back there!

I happened to glimpse an XL7 while eating at a fast food place one day. I didn't even consider Suzuki as an option, but started doing some research and decided to chose something ""out of the box"". I have to say I've not been dissapointed. It's been a great SUV and was well within my budget with all the ""bells & whistles"" a much more expensive Acadia or GMC, Tahoe or Yukon would have been.","Navigation system, 7 passenger capability, Sunroof ","More dealerships!! Due to econimc times, the dealership I purchased mine from has gone under. I now must drive over 100 miles to the next closest one for warranty service. I'm a little nervous about that. My wife wishes vanity mirrors were lighted. They are also cheap -the hinges have broken (minor)"
4.875,Great SUV,DEAN- LI ,03/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Bought the vehicle used with 9K miles on it from the dealer. The car new was 30K and I paid half that. This is my 3rd Suzuki vehicle. Presently still has 2003 XL-7 with 96K(runs great). The car has fantasitc power, smooth tranny and is confortable to drive. The fact that the car is AWD is a big plus in the snow. Interior quality, fit and feel are just fine for me. I have pulled my boat with my 2003 XL7 without a problem and the extra 70+ HP will prove to be a great addition. 22MPG in the highway and about 18MPG around town. At this point I could not be happier.","Love the sunroof and leather seating. The 3rd row spilt seating tucks away nicely but is there if you need it. Power motor and tranny are great. Exteroir styling a plus along with and long 7yr/100,000 mile warranty.","Right now, it has all I need, in a well designed package."
5,Would definitely buy it all over again!,Lewison ,02/18/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I upgraded from the Grand Vitara to the XL7 to accommodate our growing family and the extra space in the back is shockingly roomy! I can fit a large baby stroller, suitcases, and dogs all in the back together at once. My husband has even been impressed with the smooth car like ride and roominess. I love the acceleration too!  It's power is definitely understated since it moves much better than many other SUVs I've driven. ",My favorite feature is impossible to define. I can't believe all the features the car came with at the price we got it for. I couldn't drive a car without leather seating and steering wheel controls. I got it all in my XL7 and couldn't be happier.,I don't like the center console window controls - force of habit is to hit the controls on the door. It's been over three months and I still haven't gotten used to it. I wish the 7 seat option could be added later on if not purchased up front.
4.75,What A Change For The Better,Jeff ,02/04/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just bought my 2008 XL7 2 weeks ago.  I had been drivng a pickup for the last serveral years.  I feel like I am in heaven now drive this new ride.  My wife has the SX4 Sport and we love it.  Now we have two Suzuki products and do not plan on getting any other for a very long time. Plus I got at a great price. From rebates and customer cash back I am paying less than I was on the truck.  And it turns heads.  I have had several people ask me about it. I even had a guy in his (Acura SUV)the other day tell me that it was a ""very sharp ride man"".  ",The seats are comfortable and the leather feels great. Like warming my backside in the morning on the way to work also.  Smooth handling in the city. Great sound system (for stock).  Tons of room for hauling anything I would need to.  Like the small compartment in the back for storage.   ,See out the backend is hard.  But I manage fine I back it in my driveway everyday (and my drive goes al teh way to the back of my house).  
4.875,Just Purchased and Lovin it!,Vicky ,01/29/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After shopping around, my friend suggested the XL7, and I am glad I looked.   I was amazed at the features that were included with the car and such a great price!  It's sporty and stylish, yet roomy enough for my entire family.  Great car for an amazing price.","DVD system with wireless headsets- great for my kids!  Great sound system to please my husband, wonderful handling and fun to drive for me!","Only thing I don't like is the window controls in the middle, it's a habit to reach for the door instead."
4.75,Yes a steal compared to the competition,David ,01/21/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"Best bang for the buck, looked at much smaller suv's with zero room behind the supposed 3rd row that's built for a dog or cat, oh and if your kids are in the third row and your hit from behind, good luck!  Anyway needed something that the kids or an adult could could actually sit comfortably and with room behind the third row for luggage, groceries, etc. This was it!  With the rebates and incentives they took 8k off sticker! You cannot buy anything like this at that price!","Navigation, heated seats, backup camera, 5 star crash test, roomy third row, pretty much everything including all the wonderful gadgets and features.","None so far, maybe gas but anything in the category and size, even minivans get about the same, so your stuck."
5,Excellent choice,Noah ,12/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have been eying the XL7 for some time now. I owned an Aerio SX but I was hit by an elderly woman and it was totaled. I was in Japan for 3 years and all I saw was Suzuki cars every where. Hardly any Hondas. So when i got back to the States I went to the dealership offered $19000 and i drove it off the lot. I have no complaints, rides smooth and it looks good. I would call it a crossover before an SUV.   ",I like the Auto/Manual and the styling. ,Make a rear camera standard feature i can not see anything when i back up. And go with all red lighting for the gauge cluster 
4.5,Great bargain SUV,ed ,12/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,4,"Purchased a 2008 luxury trim model for the wife. So far, so good. She likes the comfy seats with heaters and the ride is smooth and car-like. The AWD is a Godsend on our horrific unfinished roads. Smooth, powerful 3.6L engine with excellent 5 speed auto trans. ","Price- Paid about $25,000. Comfort- Very comfortable ride for up to 7 passengers. Features- AWD, traction control, auto climate control, etc. Decent sound system.","MPG- we've yet to crack 22 MPG on purely highway trips. Average about 18 MPG around town. Visibility-there is none, especially out the rear window. Only the Limited gets a rear view camera. I'll be adding one soon. Lack of space behind the 3rd row seats. Quite a bit of wind noise and growly engine."
4.375,"""S"" is for super",parkaholic ,12/08/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,4,4,5,5,Looked for a long time at SUV's and decided not to buy because of price. Saw the XL-7 in a parking lot and thought it looked cool. With incentives I got XL-7 for about $9K less tha a similarly equipped Toyota or Honda. I drove it cross country and averaged 24 mpg while traveling 75 mph. I have had no complaints with fit and trim although engine noise was present during break in. Only thing I would change is the power seats need to be eight way vs six.,"Display system, auto environment controls, DVD, heated seats, remote start",Power seat adjustments
4.875,Best kept secret -- ever!,Pikie ,09/14/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this SUV so much that I just bought a second one! Very few people know anything about this vehicle. This SUV has standard stability control, traction control, ABS, 5 spd auto/manumatic transmission, auto door locks/headlights, side curtain bags - all rows, climate control, alloy wheels, privacy glass, IPOD input, 252 hp GM high feature engine(same used in Cadillac CTS, Buick Enclave, although, XL7 engine built in Japan), 7yr/100,000 mile warranty with roadside assistance, 3/36 bumper to bumper that covers even the dome light,driver information center (which allows to program lights,doors,etc),tire pressure monitor (tells you pressure for each tire). Quad 5 Star crash rating too.It's not an Equinox!","Powerful 3.6L 252hp drive-by-wire engine - built in Japan. I get 20mpg city/24-28 hwy. Awesome safety features. Beautiful exterior design. Over 95 cu. ft cargo--more than Pilot, Highlander and Murano. Best warranty. Low maintenance--no fluid changes until 100k, unlike Toyota and Honda. Price - only $17,600.",Power windows on driver door instead of center console. Better interior fit and finish
4.625,Great price and fun to drive,RUBEN ,08/17/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,5,5,5,5,I bought this car for my wife and I'm not dissapointed. The XL-7 looks great inside and out I would recommended  to family and friends planning to buy a great mid-size SUV!,Slick design and fuel economy,None
4.625,Not bad for 27K,J C Sanchez ,06/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"This is my first new ride, and I am quite pleased with my selection. I haven't had much time to drive it as it seems I'm busy 24/7 with my 2 jobs, but at least I got to take it about 60 miles outside of Denver the other day (and then back) and I'm very impressed with its ride/stability/performance and toys. With the navy blue paint and factory chrome wheels, I get plenty of compliments on my selection.",Leather seats/righteous sound system and DVD player/style and profile/and it's got plenty of power. Also like the AWD.,At times seems to have excessive road noise. I compensate for this by turning up the stereo.
4,Great 7 Seater Mid Size SUV,Mark Johanson ,05/24/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"A great value for a seven seater. The usable 2 extra back seats are great for kids yet even small adults. Plus the 2 extra seats have airbags so safety is considered (unlike other SUVs we compared) The inside design is basic and not all that stand-out yet functional. Has a very small front compartment which would be great if bigger. The back viewable area is poor due to the small windows, so I would highly recommend a back up camera system. The turning radius is large making it difficult to make tight turns like most SUVs. Safety features crash test rating are great as well as the warranty. This is probably the least expensive 7 seater mid-size SUV on the market and so far we love it.","Safe and confortable 2 extra seats on seven seater model. Able to fold down all seats to make room for loading things. Many safety features like ABS, side curtain airbags, etc","More modern internal styling, larger compartment space in front. larger back window viewing area. smaller turning radius. "
5,What a bargain,KAS ,03/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Bought this for my wife who really wanted a Toyota. However the best deal we could find on a similar Toyota was 10K more and they offered 4K less on the trade in. For $14k less I talked her into the Suzuki. I have owned many new cars of about every make and never had one that didn't have anything that needed to be corrected in the first few months. That is until the XL7 absolutly everything was perfect.  My wife loves the vehicle.,"Traction control system. We live in the country and get alot of snow. The traction control realy works well, it is great in the snow.","I wish they still had a low range, it helps in deep snow."
4.625,Suzuki hits a Home Run!,westcoastcop ,03/11/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"We looked at the Mazda 9, very nice, looked at Honda Pilot/CRV and Toyota RAV and Highlander, and the Hyundai Santa Fe/Veracruz, nice also. But when you compare all of the features and standard stuff, the Suzuki really blows them away. Adding the no deductible, 7 year 100,000 mile warranty, free loan car, that covers exerything except the battery and tires! Even a burned out bulb is covered! Amazing. And the Japanese made GM motor is smooth and powerful, and all the safety stuff gets is a 5 star rating. ","The goodies included, the warranty, the looks!",Does everything well! 
5,I love my XL7,Stephanie ,02/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have mainly owned Toyotas.  Prior to the XL7 I had a Sienna XLE.  I loved that van and didn't think I would ever want a different vehicle.  When I had the opportunity to drive the XL7 for several days I knew that was the SUV for me.  I haven't been disappointed yet!!,"Acceleration, fuel economy - I average 22 in town and 28 on the highway Interior is plush and comfortabel",
5,Happy,Cromag ,12/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We had been looking for some time at what to buy, we had setled on a rendevoux, realized they discontinued, looked at the XL7 and drove it, bought it and wife and I love it. Black with leather, can always find something wrong with anything if ya look hard enough, but for the money, we are very happy.","Wife loves the heated seats, and comfortable ride. I love driving it, and the looks. Can see the world at night.","Make backrest on back seats more contoured, our kids are grown so not a big problem."
4.75,A lot for the money,SJT ,11/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I was looking for a midsize SUV for around 30k, and drove almost all the competition. When I saw the XL7 I figured let me take this for a ride, it really was not high on my list. But after looking at all the features you get for the money, it probably is the best value on the market. It has a solid but smooth ride, great pickup and has nice style both in and out.  It has one of the best warranties in the market, very little maintenance. It even has a timing chain, instead of a belt, so you don't have that periodic $500+ expense.  Although 7 passengers is a stretch, 5 or 6 can fit fine.",Navigation system - interior controls layout.,Heated mirrors and engine noise could be a little quieter.
