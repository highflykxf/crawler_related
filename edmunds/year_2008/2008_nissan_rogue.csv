Rogue CVT Transmission failed at 119K, got it fixed under warranty from the dealer. The car failed in Savannah, GA, 640 Miles from my home. After 1280+ miles of driving to and from Savannah to collect the vehicle, the Nissan 1 rep kept saying that they don't have any policy to at least reimburse me for the rental car for the trip nor even gave me vouchers for future repairs in the vehicle, nor was willing to commit to increasing the warranty period on the new transmission. They stuck to their 'policy' throughout the conversation about not reimbursing anything. No goodwill towards the customer and no regard of what the customer has been through with a transmission failure in a car that I hoped will go at least to 200K miles without major issues. Everything was a 'No, not in our policy'. Nissan, you lost a customer today forever. Adios.",,

Service manager says ""its your trannie--it will be $3,952 to install a rebuilt one.""  Seriously!  Dealer said that was the best he could do.  How can there be so many problems with this particular CVT Transmission and Nissan not have a better plan to deal with this particular defect.

I own a Nissan Rouge and my car stopped working while I was on the freeway while my daughters were in the car.  I found out it was my transmission (CVT) but Nissan refused to replace it since I was 1,700 miles outside of the warranty.  There was no indication there was even an issue or that I should take my car in; which would have saved me thousands of dollars, prevented being without a car for over a week, and putting me and my family in grave danger.

Nissan replaced the transmission, but the car was never the same. The car couldn't handle a 40 mile trip without losing power. After driving about 40 miles and exiting the freeway, the car did not want to accelerate. After that, the air bag light began blinking. found out that this repair costs about $1600.

Then the tire function light came on, then the rattle under the driver side when I start it. Called the dealership, brought it in. (I live over an hour away- my stupidity) The tech came out after 2 hours of waiting to tell me they figured out what was wrong but the parts wouldn't be in for a couple days.

The drive shaft also failed as did the A/C compressor. We've put over $5K into this car in repairs since hitting 120K miles. 

Save yourself the money and frustration and don't buy this car or any Nissan for that matter. If you already own one, sell it before you lose all your money.  This thing is a piece of junk with a warranty that conveniently expires shortly before the CVT fails for good.

I got the patch on 11/30/09, 20 months after buying the car. My transmission failed in heavy highway traffic on 10/20/14.

After the patch Nissan extended the warranty on the CVT to 120k miles. Mine failed shortly after that and cost me 1000.00. Seems like Nissan really knew how to pick a cutoff for their extension so as to maximize cost to the customer.

4.125,CVT transmission problems,bille60 ,08/08/2013,,,4,5,3,4,,5,3,4,5,"We bought our 2008 Rogue S AWD new from the dealership. Nice looking, fun to drive, great safety features, and the AWD is fantastic. Never had to be towed. I noticed the transmission had a slight high pitch whine when it was new - going up steep hills. I thought it was just normal for a CVT. Then as time went on (about 20,000 miles) the transmission developed a loud high pitch whine going up steep hills - especially in the summer heat. At 30,503 miles the dealer replaced the transmission fluid because of my complaints about the CVT noise. Nissan has replaced 2 CVT transmissions so far.","Power, AWD, safety features.","The CVT transmission is very sensitive to heat. If you go up hills, or 70 MPH, or carry a lot of weight, expect the transmission to go into ""fail safe"" mode.
The car's computer will suddenly reduce the car's power - to protect the transmission. If the CVT transmission has a high pitch whine, and it does not go into fail safe, expect the transmission to fail soon. Unfortunately, if you are passing on a two lane road, this is most likely time that the CVT will go into fail safe mode. As just happened to me and my family, my Rogue went into fail safe while I was passing, the power was suddenly drastically reduced, and it nearly caused a head-on collision.

No help from lifters, muscle & drop a rod into a hole to hold it up.And it came with a battery that is not maintenance free. buy some distilled h2o. And the air/heater system is horrible.

New ignition switch because it would not start sometimes. This still has not fixed the prob. The car was making noises when I idled around parking lots. They replaced the cv shafts and the transmission. The problem went away but has since returned.

Our gas mileage since purchase is 23.79 MPG for total mileage of 7000+ miles. It handles very well in town as well as interstate speed of 75 MPH. When climbing steep grades it is so smooth with the transmission. No sudden jerk it just varies itself and the engine speeds up smoothly to handle the grade. We have had it for 15 months and have not had to take it in for ""ANY"" problem. It is a great vehicle. I highly recommend it.

I get pretty good mileage- 24.4-24.8 MPG for the life of the car average, which is 97% in town (compared to 30 in Corolla 1/2 fwy, 1/2 city) & I love to drive fast. I just can't resist in such a peppy car & in that aspect its way more impressive than the Corolla & its much bigger. Its very cute inside & out.

5,Love My Roque,RogueFan ,07/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love my 2008 Nissan Rogue. It is my first ""grown up"" car, and I have thoroughly enjoyed having it. My husband and I are both over 6' tall, and we both fit comfortably in the front seats.  The interior and exterior are very well-designed (this opinion is coming from a professional product designer). Nissan really did a great job of including a number of convenient features in the Rogue (i.e., a deep glove compartment, nice cup holders, an auxiliary plug, pen holders, insurance card holders, etc.).  The Rogue comes with great safety features such as side curtain air bags and a tire air pressure monitor. These are great features that come standard on the base model Rogue S.",I love having a back seat that folds down. It makes it easy and convenient to haul stuff. Those who need to carry lumber should get the Rogue SL; the front passenger seat folds down in that model but not in the S.,I would like better lighting in the trunk end of the car.  It would be nice to have mirrors on the drivers and/or passenger's sun visors.  I've also noticed that when it rains it sounds like one of my car doors is open. Somehow the sound is more noticeable in this car than others I have driven.
4.875,Would Recommend,SecondNissan ,05/26/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I have had this car for approximately three weeks. Getting used to the CVT transmission took some time, and you have to learn how to ""drive"" all over again, or your RPMs will constantly be above 3K. The interior is well put together, but I don't understand what the excitement over the Bose sound system is - it's OK, but nothing magical. The front seats are comfortable, but it would be nice if the steering wheel telescoped. The shift paddles are nice, but I don't see a need for them with the CVT - if you drive the car right, it knows what to do. The red radio display tends to wash away in bright light. Overall, a nice vehicle that I would buy again.","Cargo room, AWD, gas mileage (averaging 25+ in mixed driving).","Engine drone with CVT, telescoping steering wheel."

Getting used to the CVT takes some time... to avoid the RPM's going to 3-4K, you have to learn how to accelerate correctly. HUGE blind spots in the back due to the small windows, but the side mirrors are large and seem to help with the blind spots.

I wouldn't give up my CVT for the world. Do not miss that archaic gear shift feel from the old days.  I had an 07 Altima with the same 2.5 and CVT and glad that my Rogue came with the same.  I average 25.8 mpg and couldn't be happier.  I was averaging 31 mpg in the Altima, but I traded the slight difference in economy for utility.  Fair trade off.

My husband kept asking me to please buy a new car, but I couldn't because I didn't see one I wanted to buy, until I saw the Rogue  through the glass window of the bus I was riding home on. It's quick, fun and easy to drive, but doesn't feel like a big bulky SUV at all.  The only problem I had was finding a comfortable seat position.

I've carried 5 people on 2-3 hour long drives in comfort. The cargo room is a little tight, but I've never been lacking.

Much bigger than expected,  good road performance with the CVT,  it just takes some time getting used to the no shifting thing,  lock out the OD in hilly sections and enjoy the ride. While more features would be nice the cost of the car was quite reasonable for the quality.  I needed a new commuter car because my 1999 subaru forester with 140K miles was about to die and the new forester seemed very cheap feeling,  tried the crv (great car) but it all came down to price.

CVT is smooth & responsive. Interior is quiet, comfortable and a great layout. Leather seats are extremely comfortable. Engine is responsive & plenty quick for highway access. We tested many vehicles & for us, found the Rogue to be the best all around choice. A lot more room for people but a little less storage space, which is perfect 'cause 85% of the time we carry people... but still had no problem loading a boxed 46 in. TV!

The window\doorlock switches on the door armrest sits a few inches too far back and cannot be operated without lifting your arm off of the door rest and reaching back.  The side view mirror adjustment switch is literally under the dashboard and requires you to lean forward to operate.  The lever to slide the seat forward and back is too far down and recessed.  Visibility out of the rear window is worse than most because the window is smaller, slanted, and the rear of the vehicle is higher than driver's position.

I still wanted something fun to drive that got great gas mileage but not so pricey or high maintenance. Did a lot of research and chose the Rogue. I drive 18-20k miles a year and need something reliable and comfortable. Having owned a Camry, Maxima and A4, this my favorite. Excellent gas mileage (25-31 mpg), fun to drive, comfortable, and looks great. I was concerned about the CVT after constant problems with the Audi CVT but so far it has been fine. For a small SUV it's unbelievable how much it holds. I tailgate at football games and am able to fit the whole setup, luggage, and 3 passengers comfortably on 6 hour road trips. Love it!","High mpg, fun to drive, large glove box, all features are very user friendly, smooth ride, great on long road trips. Great looking in and out.

Leather, Bose, sunroof, Intellikey etc.  Very comfortable and large enough to do the job but small enough to be fuel efficient.  We have a 3/4 ton 4WD suburban also but it only gets about 13-14 mpg so it sits in the back yard most of the time now.  I have been a Honda liker and tried the CRV.  Did not like the way the CRV handled, it seemed rather squirrelly to me at highway speeds whereas the Rogue runs straight and true.  ","Bose stereo is nice, leather interior looks nice, quality seems good and very comfortable.  Very happy with the high mpg and regular fuel requirement in a AWD vehicle.

These people probably did not heed to the owner instructions. I am a mechanic who works for a Toyota dealership. I bought this vehicle because of the technical achievements. It is fun, it is good on gas, it is a pleasure to drive. As for the CVT, have no fear, it is great! The CVT has been used in off road and heavy duty equipment for years. The limitations of this car are negligible and in some cases non-existent. There is some room for improvement, but it is insignificant compared to the overall splendor of this exceptional vehicle.","2.5 liter engine is responsive @ 170 h.p. this car will move. i like the power steering, which is independent of the engine. also a 110 amp alternator.",Needs an oil pressure gauge and a voltage gauge.

The wife wanted a small SUV with all the bells and whistles.  After researching the costs of the competition, test drives, etc, we choose the Rogue.   It's fun to drive, slightly under powered when combined with the CVT, but we knew that going in and improved gas mileage was a much higher priority than sports car acceleration.  If I really want to drive it hard, I just slip it into manual mode and use the steering wheel paddle shifters.  Very cool option.  Gas mileage has been great with 25 in the city and 33 hiway.

I'm not thrilled with the black interior as it seems to always look dirty.  Medium colors hide the dirt better.   I was hearing a 'gurgle' sound and stopped in to have it checked out at the dealership.  I was more than surprised to find out that the CVT has to be replaced as it is slipping.  Not something you want to hear with only 4000 miles on the vehicle.   I took the car on a 700 miles trip (one way) last weekend and was thrilled with the long term comfort of the vehicle.

We didn't have problems like this with the Oldsmobile we used as a trade in. We also added a spoiler to reduce the dust and snow build- up on the back window, but it didn't do that.

4,Dangerous Windows,Elephant ,07/22/2008,,,4,4,1,4,,5,5,4,5,"I loved my new Nissan Rogue until the other day when the back side glass shattered into a million pieces without any apparent reason.  I had been home only a few minutes when I noticed the glass had shattered.  It seemed to have imploded due to the heat and air conditioning combined.  The dealership would not accept the fact that it could have been their workmanship or defect in the glass.  The glass went into the seat cover about 2 inches deep and would have severely injured a person sitting in that seat.  Luckily, the car had just been parked and no one was inside. Glass was thrown throughout the car.  No sign of damage due to vandalism or otherwise.  Be careful!!",Driving this car was fun until now.  I am concerned about safety since this incidence.

I loved the look of the Rogue and although I was not sure about the power (2.5) I could not resist the overall interior and exterior quality and extras that were offered. I purchased the Rogue SL AWD leather package and absolutely LOVE the drive. The pickup is smooth and responsive and surprisingly I do not miss the V6 at all!

It handles well around turns, in snow, and with crosswinds. With it's great stability, I don't worry about tipping over. I cannot emphasize how well it does on gas mileage in this day of high gas prices. The Bose system (premium pkg) is well worth the extra price. It is comfortable on long drives and a joy to have and own. I can't wait to drive it every day.","Gotta be the Bose stereo system and steering wheel console for the radio and bluetooth hands-free. It's easy to hook up, you can change the presets, volume, answer a call without taking your eyes from the road. A MUST HAVE for those looking to purchase.","Poor visibility from the rear when backing up. Also, my AWD SL is experiencing a rattle from the front end discovered by Nissan to be from the CVT. Noise developed after 1500 mi, and at 6,000 mi, it's still not resolved. Annoying, because it's new; frustrating waiting on a ""fix"" from Nissan."

My Rogue is it! The 4-cylinder engine has plenty of power and is surprisingly quiet. The ride is a tad stiff, but the steering is tight and seats very comfortable. Took it on a 1200 mile trip and didn't get sore bottoms. With the back seats folded down, it can hold a lot. It lets you sit up (like a van), but drives like a sports car.

There are countless people out there myself included who after 3000 miles are having major transmission problems. Nissan is aware of the issue but cannot fix it. They know its in the transmission but they don't know what it is. They've replaced transmissions just to have the car come back. If you have one, what you will hear is a rattling noise when slowing down < 10 MPH.

I drive on many rural roads as a sales rep, so needed good clearance & the AWD is great. I was used to V6 engines, so it took a bit to get used to the 4 cylinder. I think the CVT is great. I average about 25-26 MPG, when driving normally. If I really drive it hard (80 MPH) on the interstate, mileage drops to 22-23. I like everything about it except the visibility out the rear window. I guess that's why they put mirrors on vehicles. The wheel design on the SL model seems to hold snow & mud that freezes in the winter causing vibrations like the wheels are out of balance as well. Not a problem now that summer is here.","Sitting up high, Bose stereo, CVT, heated seats, & lumbar support.

She has 5,000 miles on it already, and has averaged 26.4 mpg. Not bad. She likes the bluetooth and I like the Bose. The CVT takes getting used to. When we bought the 2007 Maxima I thought that I would never get to like the transmission. But after a while it grew on us (we put 48,000 miles on the Maxima) the rogue could use a locking gas door in these times, and a way to open the hatch from the drivers seat.

My commute is 80%/20% including multiple stop and go at rush hours. Internal design is perfect, comfortable seats, nice dash, and good quality material. Everything works perfectly.

I'm amazed at how quickly I am adapting.   She's full of pep and as smooth a ride as you could possibly hope for.  Doesn't feel small at all, but it's on a Sentra platform!   Quite honestly, I actually look forward to the drive to and from work since I picked up my Rouge!   Thanks Nissan!   ",I love the way it looks!

Considered Mit.Outlander, Sub.Forester and Rogue.  Decided on Rogue for drive and features. Drove 200mi to pick up. Avg mpg on trip home was 26 on brand new motor!!  A little disappointed in ride. Not as smooth as remembered in test drive, but it's okay. Got premium and tech pkg so have Bose, Bluetooth, XM, premium seats. Would have liked leather, but couldn't get all pkg'd with the color I wanted. (Gotham Grey) Would like more storage in front. Glovebox is huge, but not a lot of space for small things.

Drove all the vehicles in the small SUV segment, liked the Nissan the best overall.  I splurged and got all the options; leather, moon roof, heated seats, paddle shifters, etc.  I will be ordering the rear wing/spoiler as it wasn't available when I purchased my Rogue.  I've had a ton of folks say they really like its looks. Avg MPG so far on 2 tanks of gas is 22.6 with a 60/40 split of city/hwy driving.  Pretty good for something my wife and kids can fit in comfortably.","Interior features, all the controls on the steering wheel, blue tooth, XM radio, general look of the vehicle, safety equipment","Better acceleration from full stop, and of course better MPG is always welcome, firmer suspension as there is some body roll on sharp corners, but nothing I can't live with, and the wife likes the smoother ride it delivers."

Driving requests are fulfilled flawlessly.  Steering is very responsive, as are braking and accelerating.  CVT pulls hard under acceleration, making interstate merging quite easy.  Very nimble in traffic, yet comfortable on the highway.  Entry and exit very comfortable, as is the unlimited fan speed selector.  Great move Nissan.

I love not having to deal with keys at all since I have a toddler. Love the Bose sound system but above all, love the ride!

My work commute is 104 miles round trip, 90% of which is highway in Atlanta. I test drove many crossover SUVs (Honda CRV, Mazda CX7, and Toyota Rav 4) and liked Rogue the best. It had the quietest engine, nicest stereo, and most comfortable seats. After just 1,400 miles I am averaging 26.1 mpg. I am writing this because I read almost all 95 Edmund reviews for this car before making my decision. I thought it was only fair to return the favor. BTW -  I am probably not the target consumer -  I am 54 years old but love this fun car to drive combined with my moonroof, music, iPod interface and awesome Bose stereo system.","Moonroof, Bose stereo, stereo controls on the steering wheel, iPod interface, quiet 170 horsepower engine with pickup and power, and great miles per gallon. Also, can you believe the size of the glove box? Did I mention the Bose stereo sounds great. ",Possibly consider putting the auxiliary jack and a cigarette lighter power source in the center console instead of on the stereo (Honda CRV feature) to keep the iPod hidden.

Before we bought this car, we had test driven Honda CR-V, Subaru 2009 Forrester, RAV-4 and Matrix 2009 AWD. Rogue provides the best balance for what we are looking for in its segment. It's responsive, beautifully designed inside and out. The gas mileage is reasonable. Best of all, you get the best value out of the money you spend.

Really was not too much of a compromise in features and comfort. Although slightly smaller, all of the features of the SL are similar to the base model of the Murano SL. The Rogue has impressive power for a 4 cyl. The interior has all of the options that you need in a car an none of the costly items like GPS,dual temp controlas and DVD. Surprisingly the gas mileage estimates are accurate for our driving style. Truly Nissan has created a veicle that is fun and affordable. Really worth the money.",Keyless entry and the controls on the front of the steering wheel. The information console that is on the speedometer console. The deep glove box.,"Oddly, there is no auto control for the exterior lights so you have to remember to turn them off.

This was the best value for money. The design is smart, seats  comfortable, dash lighting very soothing, controls conveniently placed and the sound system is commendable. The ride is very smooth (the CVT makes it smoother) and is the quietest among all its competitors. The vehicle is extremely responsive and has a tight turning radius. The suspension is remarkable, and I hardly feel the potholes I drive over.

I have driven everything from AWD minivans, Honda and Izuzu SUVs, and finally a Pacifica.  My Rogue is by far my favorite, it could be that it is 'cute' and or that it has exceptional interior space compared to the exterior size.  It has been reliable in the mountains of West Virginia and I have had no problems with bad roads.

It handled unimproved dirt roads like a champ, across boulder strewn creeks in the high desert foothills of Arizona to ten inch deep sand beaches in Mexico.  The awd worked effortlessly. If you don't look at the rpm gauge it acts no differently than any other car in cruise or passing at highway speeds.

I really tested it 2 days later is 9"" of wet and heavy snow and it exceded my expectations for sure.  We have had our ignition keyswitch lock on us about 4 times and I had to rock the vehicle back and forth and shake the wheel to get it to release, since using the e-brake before parking it seems to take the pressure off of it. A grocery cart even at slow speeds will do damage to the plastic way to easily because of no bumpers. The rearview has a blind spot be careful.","Very comfy to drive, like the over style, handles very well in snow.","Hard to judge when backing up because of the limited visibility, it seems you have to rely 100% on mirrors because if you turn around, you cant see anything.

I looked at the CR-V, the CX-7 and Rav4 but wasn't pleased with any of them. We happened to pull up next to what turned out to be a Rogue at a stoplight a few weeks ago. I now own a full-tilt model AWD SL.  The interior, particularly the heated leather seats, is great. I've had several Accord coupes in the past with wonderful leather interiors, and these are equals.  Very smooth, great Bose sound. AWD feels solid.",Bluetooth is a real revelation; included XM radio; xenon headlights; quality of the leather seats and the interior in general.,"A few more nooks or crannies in the dash or console area? Molded trays not quite big enough to fit an iPhone (or a Blackberry or Treo, therefore). We're buying a sensor system for the rear so we can park the thing with some clue about where the car ends.

All of them were well built with good features.  Rogue had the most going for it.  Loaded mine with AWD, SL, premium package, leather, moonroof.  I am in the first week of ownership and so far no regrets.","Keyless entry, bluetooth, homelink, paddleshifters.  I expect great (28+) highway gas mileage.","Interior similar to the 2004 350Z I owned.  Too much plastic.  Driver's seat listed as 8-way, but really only 6- way.

I think the features are great and are conveniently laid out. Versitility is amazing, The seats could have just a little more support for the lower back and the SL 2wd premium package could have included the HID lights, bluetooth and it would be great to have turn signals in the mirrors. But overall it is a great car with just the right attitude and good gas mileage (about 25)","Bose, rear storage, room, versatility, sunroof, handling.","2wd premium package could have the HIDs, bluetooth, turnsignal mirrors and just a little more lower back support.

5,A Solid Choice,Rick ,02/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased the Rogue with all the bells and whistles. It has a smooth quiet ride in the city. It could be a little more quiet on the highways, due to noise leaks in the aft. If your looking for a stylish compact SUV this is a good option. You get all, if not most of the features you find on similar vehicles. However, the price is thousands less.","Bose sound, smooth ride, upscale styling, CVT acceleration.","Auto headlights, dual zone climate control, rear seat arm rest, reverse sensors, seal the rear hatch better."

Otherwise I love this vehicle.","Handling, especially on snow and ice. Comfortable roomy seating. Great looking vehicle.",Rear compartment light. Side rub stripe and door edge protectors.
4.875,The Rogue is wonderful!,NewRogue2008 ,01/19/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After test driving numerous cars and smaller SUVs, I kept coming back to the Rogue.  It offers great features (not offered on other cars in its class), numerous safety features, and comfortable seats (unlike the Honda CR-V which I also had considered - the EX-L hurt my back like crazy after a 15 minute test drive).  The Rogue has great fuel economy (for an AWD SUV), looks sleek, and drives so smooth! Its visibility compares to every other smaller SUV that I have ever driven.  So, as a former sedan driver, visibility in my new Rogue seems just fine to me. I love it!","Bose stereo sounds great - love the XM radio (no more exposed wires from my old Roady!) and 6 disc changer, Bluetooth, moonroof, pop-up cargo bag holder, comfortable seats, Xenon headlights work great, cool interior lighting, love the way my iridium graphite with black leather looks!

5,I think I'm in love with my Rogue,Senor Rogue ,01/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is just such a great car, I couldn't be happier unless it dispensed cookie dough from the glove compartment. I love the style, comfort, handling, dashboard controls, paddle shifters. I opted not to get bluetooth+keyless, and it would have been worth the couple extra bucks a month, but that's my failing, not the Rogue's. So many people compliment me on it. It's made my hour-long commute in heavy LA traffic a real pleasure - I actually feel kind of sad every time I leave it in the garage overnight, but it's too big to sleep at the foot of the bed (and I think my dog would get jealous). I researched the heck out of my new purchase and made the right choice.","dashboard controls, steering wheel controls, handling, good gas mileage (23 MPG avg in heavy traffic), exterior styling/color (got the indigo blue model - it rocks!)","XM controls could be clearer, lock the gas cap, if they made this a hybrid it would be the perfectest car ever, doesn't seem to auto-lock (I do not have keyless entry)."
4.5,A Good Choice,LesMan ,01/18/2008,,,4,4,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I've owned the Rogue for over a month and and am very happy so far. My choice was down to the Rogue vs. the new Honda CRV. While its hard to find anything wrong with  the CRV, I was able to get the fully-loaded AWD Rogue for several thousand cheaper than a similar CRV. Also with Honda you have to add things like fog lights, compass mirror and roof rack after purchase, which is a hassle. This SUV is fun to drive,  has good power and lots of cool features that come with the SL AWD.  It takes a while to get used to the CVT and the engine is a bit noisy accelerating up hills, but otherwise smooth.  The Bose sound system is a must - one of the cleanest sounds I've heard in a car.",Bluetooth connectivity; Bose sound; Radio display system; Satellite radio (3 months free); smooth ride.,More cupholders; automatic climate control as an option; locking fuel door; better positioning of rear view mirror; auto headlights.
4.375,Excellent Mini-Murano,Artie ,01/18/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"We replaced our 98 Subaru Outback with a 2008 Rogue. We were looking for better fuel mileage and another 4WD vehicle.  After several months, we found the Rogue.  Loved it from the get go.  The only issues I would note are 1. Reflections of dash trim in the side mirrors, 2. no locking gas cap or door, 3. worried about paint issues around hatch hinges - sheet metal bends too easily 4. Tire Pressure Warning cannot be de-activated for winter tires on seperate wheels unless they are equipped with special valves.  We have about 2500 miles on the car and we love it so far.

5,Happy with the choice,Badgerfan ,01/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Have only owned the car for a few weeks, but living in WI we have had a good opportunity to test out the AWD in snow and rain and it is outstanding.  We looked at other crossovers, but have owned three Nissan Maximas with total satisfaction, so went with the Rogue.  I had a PT Cruiser for five years and it was a nice little car, but I have to say this is much more enjoyable to drive.  The front passenger seat on the PT Cruiser folded down and I found I used this feature all the time.  The others like Rav4 didn't have this available. My wife's car is an Acura TL and she even loves to drive this car.","Fold down passenger seat, intellegent key, Xenon headlights, Blue tooth, AWD, satellite radio.  Value for the dollar.","The instrument panel is a little strange.  Both the tachometer and speedometer are 5"" gauges, then in a 2"" gauge in the middle are the fuel and temp gauge, odometer, trip odometer, trip computer, outside air and CVT position. Some of this should have been included in the other two gauges"
4.75,Rogue Beats the Competition,AutoNut134 ,01/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4," After exhaustive internet research and several trips to the car dealers and several test drives, I (and my wife) decided that the Rogue simply offered the most bang for the buck. Some of the factors we took into consideration were fuel economy, safety features, trade-in value, and price. The Mariner was excluded because of price and no stability control. The RAV4 was nice but Toyota wouldn't really deal and I didn't like the spare on the outside. The CRV was the closest competitor with good quality and a nice feel. The Roque has plenty of power good fuel econ and high tech toys. This car fit our needs nicely. Easy to drive and park. Has a good quality feel. Traded in an 05 Pathfinder. ","Bluetooth, paddle shifters, black leather with red stitching gives the interior very sporty feel, HID headlights, Bose sound and satellite kick. AWD feels very safe, excellent braking, very quite ride. Compass on mirror. Smartkey totally rocks",Center armrest with cupholder for rear seats. Put fuel door on driver's side.
5,I'M IMPRESSED,delighted in Dayton ,01/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We have had the Rogue now for a week.  I am very impressed with the quality and all we got for the money we paid.  We have been true blue Toyota owners for years, but we were not impressed with the Rav 4.  The Rogue won out in our thorough research of every possible choice on the market.  It sits high enough to be above other cars, but is a comfortable step up into the car.  We did get all the bells and whistles.  Just had 5 inches of snow here in Ohio, and the AWD worked like a charm.  Can't recommend it enough.  Considering my wife wanted a Lexus, I pushed for the Rogue and she is liking it very much.

Let me tell you that after doing a lot of research (CR-V, RAV4, Tucson), I found the Nissan Rogue the best SUV/CUV you can find in the market.

The keyless fob actually has a key in it to get in the car if the battery goes dead. I love the keyless entry. The Bose stereo is awesome. The seats are comfortable and it is absolutely fun to drive. My boyfriend bought one 2 weeks later. My gas mileage is great at 22.8 city and 25.878 Hwy before break in. I like the bag storage in the way back to keep packages from shifting. Love the bluetooth! You gotta get one of these!!,I love the red light illumination for night driving. The keyless fob is great when I have my granddaughter in my arms. The way back is big enough for my 78 lb doberman.

So we started our research and compared all of the different mid-sized SUVs out there in the <$30K price range.  I was truly surprised when we finally test drove the Nissan Rogue.  It had many of conveniences you'd find in a luxury car, the performance  experience you'd want in a sports car, the fuel efficiency you'd expect from a compact car, the storage space you need in a SUV, and the safety features you'd demand in a family car.

There is also noticeable road noise (wind) that seems to be coming from the hatch area as if it weren't sealed properly. Seating is very comfortable. I wasn't happy w/the factory black leather w/red dots so I opted for dealer installed black leather. IMO, it's much nicer. The Bose stereo is excellent. Nissan forces XM on you, so you will need to install an aftermkt Sirius radio thru the aux port. ",The Rogue gets high marks for exterior looks. It handles very well for a SUV.

It has great features, fun to drive, great price, and superb build quality. I have had the pleasure of buying and owning some 94 other vehicles in my lifetime and this is in the top five. My compliments to the factory engineering and design staff at Nissan. Nissan dealers have some great and fun vehicles to sell us.","CVT, fun to drive handling, bose system with 6 cds, overall styling and driveablility, bluetooth phone, xm radio, comfort seating.","backup camera option, navigation option"
4.75,Rogue Review,ILRogue ,11/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"So far, the Rogue ownership experience has been positive.  Comfortable ride, ample space for 2 adults and 3 kids.  Good room in the back.  Nice features and price points, which allows you to select how high or low you want to go in the features vs. price debate.  The i-AWD feature is great for wet pavement - one can only hope for the same in the snow.  Reliability is yet to be determined (too new).",Comfortable seating and good height options.  Bose sound system and MP3 capability.  Keyless entry/ignition is wonderful.,"Too many buttons on the steering wheel.  Defrost/AC system is really strange (AC does not come on when in defrost, but automatically turns on when you return the air output to floor level).  Need door guard options to prevent dings."
5,Love at First Sight!,Granny G ,11/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"As a senior citizen formerly driving a Toyota Corolla, I wanted something a little different for probably my last car.  I was considering a Tucson or CR-V, but the minute I saw the Rogue in Venom Red it was love at first sight!  I love it so far, though I am still trying to figure out some of the (many) bells & whistles.  It is fun to drive, and I believe Nissans are very reliable, also.",Styling. Color (Venom Red Pearl). Good value for the price.,"Improved rear visibility, plush seats, gas cover opens from inside, not outside, headlights go on when it gets dark & go off automatically, rear window (in lift gate) opens, doors lock automatically when you get in"
5,The Rogue Rocks,ssaunder ,11/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The first thing to get used to is the CVT.  Since there are no actual gears to run through, you do not realize your speed.  The fit and finish is superbly Nissan.  The driver's seat feels like a cockpit.  The seat height is perfect to feel off the road and in command.  Love the satellite radio.  The bluetooth was the first thing we configured, then the homelink.  Nice features in this sub-30K vehicle.   Feels very luxurious in SL with all options.",AWD.  Bluetooth.  Homelink.  Leather.

5,worth it,happyrogueowner ,11/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,The rogue brings a nicer design than the RAV4 and CRV for a better price and mpg consumption. The driving is super nice and the engine responds better than the other V4 of the same category.,"size, mpg compared to competitors, price compared to main competitors: RAV4 and CRV.",cargo cover should be standard item.
5,Rogue SL: It WILL Be Hot!,MHmidhudson ,11/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I picked it up on October 1. Today is Nov. 13, and its got 2450 miles on it already. Gets 23-24 mpg locally, hilly terrain in the Hudson valley; 29 mpg at a steady 60-65 mph on the road! Never have owned a vehicle that sticks to the road like this one does. What they've already said about Bluetooth and Bose is echoed here: THEY ROCK. This is my next ""best car I've ever owned"", a title that my '06 Frontier still holds.",Intelligent key... no key in ignition switch. Satellite radio and 6-CD changer. Quiet inside.,Dress up the front end: 'body color' grille doesn't cut it. I'm gonna buy the bra just to cover it.
5,Love my New Rogue,Bill ,11/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Overall excellent vehicle.  I am very happy with the way it drive and rides. So far for a brand new car gas mileage around town 25.1 mpg,"Bluetooth phone, XM radio. Peppy and fun to drive.",Auto down/up passenger window would be nice.
5,Nissan Rogue SL AWD Review (no prem pkg),ReluctantBuyer ,11/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I don't usually complete reviews but had to share my Rogue experience.  As a reluctant buyer after several ""car payment free"" years, I wanted all the latest safety features, great gas mileage, proven quality, AWD, and a sporty look. Nothing on the market was interesting me enough to warrant the payment. Then I saw the Rogue. Its Altima motor and Sentra platform, both rated above average, helped with the quality concerns with a new model (bought the ext warranty too).  I browsed the online inventory of nearby Nissan dealers, chose a Rogue, took it for a drive, bought it and am loving every minute I drive it - it's great! Online prep makes dealer part go much smoother and more quickly!","AWD & VDC is amazing on wet roads - should be as good on snow, stability is solid on interstates with trailer trucks flying by, the CVT downshifts automatically on hills to slow down or give that extra assist up, cabin is roomy and comfortable and has sporty look inside to match the sharp exterior.",Offer the moonroof package without the premium package.  Add daytime running lights.  
5,Great car to drive,Lynn4137 ,11/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I got the fully loaded AWD with all the add-ons. I find the ride very smooth and comfortable. Style is an eye catcher and Blue Tooth and Home Link are features you normally only find in high priced cars. Nissan never disappoints when it come to class in its cars.,Interior appointments. Comfort of seats and ride in general. Great pick up for a four cylinder. Very pleased.,Dual control heat and air.
4.875,I love this crossover!,Amanda ,11/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love the styling and the interior space of the Rogue, from the outside you think, wow, I don't know if that is big enough and then you sit down on the inside and you think where the heck did all this space come from!! I love all of the spacial features, nooks and pockets galore. I will say the CVT takes a bit of getting used to. I instinctively tune into the engine and I know when my car goes to the next gear, but in this car there's no pause or shift to the next gear. It's really cool, just unusual. The stability bars in the front and rear give excellent cornering and turning abilities. ","I love the side curtain airbags, the kickin' stereo and interior design. Oh yeah, the center seatbelt in the back seat has it's own shoulder belt, not just a lap belt. I never seen a car that has that. ",None right now. 
4.875,I love this car,Amanda ,10/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The Rogue is a wonderful vehicle. It meets most of my criteria for an suv, but it's so much more fun to drive. Buy one today! It has tons of standard features that in other cars you must pay extra for. I love the stability bars in the front and rear that allow great cornering. I love the 170 HP too. Love it!","Stability bars, tons of storage.",I can't think of any.
5,Mini-Murano,ESQMEDIC ,10/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought this car for my wife. I never thought she would accept a Nissan from previous experiences, however she loves it! Nissan has come along way. We were going to buy a Murano instead we got the mini lol. She loves all the bells and whistles this model comes with including the heated leather seats. My two year old daughter loves it as well, when we picked her up with it she replied wowwww!","Awesome acceleration! Bluetooth rocks! Bose stereo with XM and a 6 CD, tunes forever!","Gas mileage however not bad for an AWD vehicle, more backseat room, fewer steering wheel features."
5,"Great car, everything I need.",sirbikesalot ,10/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my fourth Nissan after having owned a Stanza, Maxima, and Xterra. I traded in my 2000 XTerra and bought the Rogue after test driving it. It handles great, very comfortable (I am 6'-2""), and quiet inside. I got the AWD in wicked black with no other options. It meets all my needs, except for one that I need to wait for - a Class 3 tow hitch with the 2"" receiver for my hitch-mounted bike rack. It's a little smaller than the Xterra but I won't miss it and I certainly won't miss the poor gas mileage of the Xterra. All my Nissans have been super reliable and I expect no less from this car.",Aux input for iPod. CVT for smooth acceleration. Quiet interior. Just the right amount of road feel and engine braking. Drives like a car. Good turning radius. You get a lot for your money with the Rogue. ,When using an inverter to charge my iPod and the aux input I get a buzzing noise probably due to insufficient or improper grounding. 
4.875,Rogue... what took you so long!,King ,10/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"This a fun, delightful, amazing crossover SUV.  What an impression Nissan made with this innovative vehicle.  It is great on mileage, style, and ride.  We got out of a Mazda 6s and the ride feels better, the mileage is just as good, and the style is truly astonishing.  We are getting compliments everywhere we go with the Rogue.  The only qualm I have is the power, I would like to have more horses, but I am very happy with what I have now. If you are trying to look for a great crossover with plenty to offer at a great price, look no further.  We truly looked at all other crossovers, both foreign and domestic, and the Rogue is by far the best!","The fit, the styling inside and out, satellite radio, the fold down flat back seats for hauling my huge dogs... I have a Great Dane and American Bulldog.  And again I reiterate the STYLE!!!",More power... but the Rogue is worth it!
4.625,Our Little Rogue,Nishaw ,10/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"After having a wreck in our Murano, we only went to the dealer to ""look"" at the Rogue. Needless to say we fell in love. Love at first drive!! This vehicle has the smoothest ride, even better than the Murano. My only complaint is the interior dashboard area. I don't know what kind of material it is but it easily scratches. All and all I would definitely suggest you take it for a test drive.","Bluetooth and intelligent key entry, Boise sound system.",The lumbar area of the seats and the interior dashboard.
4.75,Great New Crossover,todd ,10/19/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We traded in our 2002 GMC Envoy to purchase a crossover with better gas mileage.  We test drove the Honda CR-V and the Saturn Vue. Fell in love with the nissan rogue test drive. Very comfortable on the inside, dashboard layout is clean and simple, very peppy four cylinder and corners well (have the SL which comes with 17"" tires).  The stock radio was surprisingly powerful.Wish the vehicle had an adjustable center console cover.  Slso wish the vehicle came with colored body side molding.  Affordable and smart looking.

5,What a great  purchase!,Mary ,10/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I bought my Gotham Grey Rogue last week and it has got to be the best car/truck/SUV I have ever driven! It's sporty yet practical!  Can't wait to try out that AWD on these Colorado mountains! Hard to believe that the smooth ride and comfort is classified as a truck (??) I highly recommend if you are in the market take it for a test drive! You'll fall in love with it!,,
4.875,I love this crossover!!,Colleen ,10/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Wow-- this car has it ALL. We opted for the SL, no x packages.The one we purchased came with floormats, splash guards and a moonroof.  The seats are incredibly comfortable. Even the back seats are somewhat form fitted to your body! The leg room is unbelievable. We fit 2 booster seats and a carseat in the back. The cargo area is very large, with hidden compartments. There was ample room for 2 bales of hay for our Halloween display.  The ride is smooth and with the CVT, you cant feel the car shift at all. Its a very quiet ride too. I would definitely recommend to everyone.","The comfortable seats, instrument panel and the fact that I am five feet tall and it's easy for me to drive.  My husband is six feet tall, and its comfortable for him as well. ",Brighter cargo light in the trunk :)
5,Try it-You'll LOVE it!,shelley ,10/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just bought this weekend and love it! Much more comfy than CRV and handles like a dream. Traded in a 2 door Accord & could not be happier. Accord is great, but the Rogue has wonderful seats and has more of a cockpit feel to the controls than all other suvs driven. If you are thinking about an suv, do yourself a favor and drive this - you won't be sorry.",Seats. Radio. Smoothness of driving.,Sirius instead of XM. Add slight window tinting on front driver/passenger windows to match rest of car.
5,More than I could ask for this price!,Rocky ,10/15/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I was in the market for a small SUV for over 6 months. I started looking in the 25k range and then moved to the 35k range to get all the features I wanted. The problem, however, was that I didn't want to commit to a payment that would tighten my purse strings every month. When I found the Rogue, it was everything I wanted and fun to drive!! It was also priced right. I love everything about the car. My husband, who was convinced the 2.5L engine wouldn't give enough power has also been surprised and I can hardly get him out of the drivers seat!! I truly think you get a lot for you money in the small SUV. ","Bluetooth, Intelligent Key, seat comfort (leg room as a 5'11' female is important), smooth ride, console layout.","The only real complaints I have heard about the Rogue concern options not available (3.5L engine, navigation, etc.). Since I did not want the options, I see no cons in the vehicle! I am of the opinion that is why there are so many cars out there to choose from! It is perfect for my needs."

5,The best smaller SUV on the market now!,tsar1269 ,10/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I purchased the AWD SL version in black with a black leather interior. I added all the bells and whistles as options to the car and it rocks! When I went to pick it up in the showroom, there was a crowd of people surrounding it. It is a show stopper!  My favorite thing with this car is the bluetooth integration. I love being able to make calls from the car thru voice activation.  It has never confused a command I speak or get a number wrong when I speak to it.  The leather interior is flawless. You have as much leg room in the back seat as the front.  I also love the fact that the glove box is big enough for a laptop if you so wish.  ","Bluetooth, size, ease of driving.","A little more smoother of a ride, wider sunroof opening, more convenient access to onboard computer."
4,Solid contender to the CRV and RAV4,Mitchlav ,10/07/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"I was very pleased with the reponsiveness of the Rogue on the road.  It drives more like a sedan than a typical SUV and is far more comfortable to drive or ride in than our Honda CRV.  Road noise has not been a problem, and I think we're getting about 27mpg highway, which is as advertised.","SL model is nicely appointed.  I think it has more acceleration than CRV or RAV4, and is a comfortable car to drive.","The cloth upolstery is a neoprene-like material, and may not wear well.

Wash a car once and you learn a lot. Not only is the Venon (pearl) Red paint luxurious, but the application is perfect. This complements the fit of the doors that have rubber weather strips to seal out water and dirt protecting the rocker panels.",The Intelligent Key system makes the Premium package premium.

The crossover is really fun to drive, handling is superb, very quiet even at 80 MPH on highway. The exterior design is very nice and refreshing, I think Nissan designers have done a great job. It has much better outside appeal then Rav4/Honda CRV. The interior is very well laid out. The second row is comfortable for this size of the vehicle. Has MP3/aux input as standard - what else! The gas mileage on the highway so far has been in 27 and change range, right on mark what shows on the sticker. So far no complaints. Fun vehicle to own.",The Bose system. Brakes are superb.

Went shopping and had plenty of cargo room. Dash very smart, simple and sporty, all gauges easily readable, acceleration more than ample, car feels like going slow at 65 mph, tried paddle shifters, fun but not necessary, grey with grey interior, beautiful and classy, wife so happy with car, never saw her like this with a new car, she loves the look, the feel, the comfort.
