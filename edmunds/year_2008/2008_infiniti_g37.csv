I'm 5'3"" and find the G very comfortable.

I've only driven the G37 about 4 times so far, but I love it and can't wait to drive it again. It's quiet and comfy when you want it to be, but can certainly growl and perform with the push of a pedal. Some say the brakes are touchy, I say precise.

This car delivers.  It's not going to beat many other sports cars off the line but that mid powerband in the car is wonderful.  Steady constant power all the way through the large band.  One thing I don't particularly like is the clutch seems a bit mushy.  Overall though this is a much sexier car than a 335 by BMW.  With the blend of luxury and performance there really isn't anything out there in this price point that competes with it well. ,"Bose upgrade, Ipod connectivity, brakes, sultry exhaust sound","better clutch, more low end torque, higher horsepower, possibly turbocharged, full leather interior.

After the G37 came out I went and bought a 2 door G37 S with all the fixings including the 6 speed manual and navigation. This car is not only fast, but reliable and sexy all at the same time. A car with all of it's features normally sells for thousands of dollars more. Infiniti also made the interior of the car a lot better now and it is up to par with some of the nicer luxury cars out there.

This car, for this price point, is unmatched (if you are looking at BOTH performance and luxury). The design is simply breathtaking. With ivory pearl paint, it's such a head turner. Ironically, G37 has a high exclusivity for a bargain price at its class. Interior is very nice, although could do with a little more insulation. The 3rd gear is what I call the auto gear because it is perfectly tuned for city driving, although 2nd gear is the real deal. 6th gear is the gran touring aka cruising mode. Overall, funnily, G37S somehow feels and looks more expensive than it really is. Count it: design, performance, exhaust, Nav, feel, price. All in one.","Design. Exhaust note (cannot be imitated by other cars even with the same exhaust piping). Gear ratios. Nav is amongst the best. Love the roughness at high RPM. Steering precision and feel. Dashboard. TAILIGHTS. Washi hard to scratch. Oh, and the (sports!) seat is more comfy than A4 or C-class. Ha! ","Seatbelt mechanism. Blind spot. A few cheap plastic parts. Ipod song scrolling too slow.

The 08 is improved although not perfect.  Otherwise this car is amazing in every way.  It's really a little surprising that Nissan can make this car for this price point.  It really looks, feels and drives like a much more expensive car.  Really unbelievable!!!!  Great job Nissan and your Infiniti cohorts.  In my first 1000 miles MPG, hiway is 24-25 and expect to improve a bit with break-in.  Only change would be to give just a little more off the line, although I imagine that would stress the components more with 330 horses on tap.  Also would be nice to see the rev match shift!!","Rumble at idle, the feel and sound of the engine and exhaust as you climb past 4000 rpm. Smooth handling in hi speed maneuvers.

5,Drive one if you can!,rgaz ,06/12/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I can reiterate all the good reviews.  This car is fun to drive in all conditions and can smoke the tires with ease.  I recommend driving with the VDC off so you can really have fun.  The VDC can be a bit too overbearing for my tastes. First let me say that the G37S is hands above most cars to compare, so my very minor complaints are just because when you stare at almost perfection, you are bound to find something.  The 5-speed shifter throw is too long for my tastes.  For a sports car the 1-2 shift should be the shortest possible, and it is not.  Again, minor.  The tires are great combination, but in the larger rims, they are very expensive to replace. Really, a great car.  Drive it and see.",True combination of sport and luxury. Fun to drive. Exhaust note is a symphony. Athletic body.,"This is the tough area.  Only minor, but the shift throw is too long.  MP3 searching on the console is too cumbersome and hard to work with (a ""page down"" button would help!).

This is the best sports coupe your money can buy without completely splurging and buying a Corvette.  Plus, it seats 4 halfway comfortably!  I've owned this car for over one year, and it still feels like a new toy every time I drive it, or even look at it.  I'm a very thorough researcher, and I couldn't find another car with the performance, looks, and features of this one in the price range.  Once I test drove it, the decision was a complete no brainer.","Intelligent cruise control - I always drive with cruise control, unless I'm in really thick traffic.  All I have to do is steer.  There's a long list of other favorite features - power, steering, braking, handling, interior comfort, navigation, paddle shifters.

I checked the Beemers and was not impressed at all, their dealer experience leaves much desired. Also considered the Subaru WRX Sti, too much $$ for a souped up econobox.

And let me say this car has more seating room then the Lincoln LS I traded in.  With the wide range of seat adjustments I fit in this car with no issues either from leg room or headroom (with sunroof).

It is a real head turner on the road-- I've been stopped by strangers in parking lots and at stoplights who tell me how great looking my car is. Drive is much smoother than my G35 coupe-- quieter too. A real pleasure to drive. I agree with other posters-- don't buy this car and complain about gas mileage.

The bimmers seem quicker since the G is such a heavy car. However, the G seems more refined than the M3 which suffered from a loose and clunky differential. The G's differential is much tighter giving an overall smoother & solid feeling. However, the clutch uptake is abrupt (similar to bmw). The navigation of the G is more user friendly, even compared to the iDrive in the newer bmws. It is touch screen and voiced activated. The G37 is a better value since you get more included options rather than having to add them separately like German cars.",A smoother and overall more solid feeling car compared to my past bmws which gives me confidence in its reliability.

And don't give me that ""oh its a sportscar nonsense"". The M3 and 330Ci coupes both had more backseat room and trunk space than the G37.

The option of Gear Shifter to F1 Paddle Shifter is so much fun. The ride is so much quieter with better sound insulation from the road noise which helps when I'm on the phone compare to my old 2005 G35 Sport.",Create the back seat with a cushion in the middle instead of the hard plastic that just collects clutters. G37 Sport models should design a more aggressive spoiler with an option of elevated rear wing in which this powerful car deserves. If they did I'll be the first one to install it.
5,G37 Sport 6MT with NAV & PREMIUM Packs,akun24 ,12/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We traded our '05 G35 Coupe 5A with Premium and Sport packs for this '08.  Love the new styling, it is much classier than the old one.  The ride is much smoother and refined, the new car is a good bit quiterer too.  ","Love the new VQ-37 motor and the overall styling the most, but the sound system has the biggest variety of connections I've seen in a car.  A big fan of the memory seats too with the intelligent key.","My only real complaints are that the shifter and clutch could use some work, it is a better setup than the previous models, but infiniti could still learn a lot from Honda in this area.  If I could just take the shifter and clutch from My S2000 and put it in this car, I would be ecstatic!"
4.875,All I thought it was,Kappa88af ,11/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I test drove the Porsche 911, BMW 335 & M Roadster, S2000, Corvette and decided on the G.  I have the Blue Slate w/every option except 4wheel steering.  I've had the car for four weeks and I don't regret a thing.  The power is on point, the electronic gismos are easy to operation, handling is responsive.  I haven't opened her up because of the required break in period of 1200 miles.  I'm at 800 now.  Pound for pound, you can't go wrong.  This is my first Infiniti product and I'm loving every minute.  A word of caution.  On model produced after July 07, you lose some of the voice features such as telling the car what temp to change to and what radio station.  Other that than you will be pleased","Power, nav, iPod connect, sound system styling, heck everything",Bring back the voice commands that were deleted.
4.875,G37 Journey-Premium-Nav-Tire Package,Ed ,11/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I purchased the car last week and I love the way it handles and its looks.  I have been getting nothing but compliments on the car from friends and people on the road.  The rear view camera is very helpful.,"The voice activated commands are very nice (air conditioning, radio and GPS). The navigation system is very easy to use.",At this point I can't think of anything that I would improve on the car.
4.875,G37 Sweet Ride,BLJ ,11/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"2008 Journey w/Sport/Navi/Premium Platinum Graphite/Stone  This car has it all for a coupe.  450 miles on the engine and breaking it in easy, but can tell there is a lot of power waiting to be unleashed.  Great handling, great sound system, the navi system with real time traffic is accurate and easy to use.  Video inputs as well, can play PacMan on the navi with those battery powered old arcade games. 19 inch wheels with Sport Pkg are really nice looking.  A bit bumpy on those weird sections of highway but overall a nice ride for a Sport model.  The auto trans shifts nicely up/down, very comfortable shifting.  Paddle shifters and DS drive modes make this coupe worth getting as an automatic.","Navi, paddle shifters, phone integration, sound system.","Tight in the back, but the carseat fits for those times the family goes out in this car.  small trunk too, but these items are not important for daily commute.  "
4.75,"Great Sports Coupe, Needs to Lose Weight",M.C. ,09/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I enjoy my G37 S 6-speed. It has every option except nav and Tech. pkg. I don't agree that this car is fast, it's quick, but not fast. If this car can drop 200 lbs and add 35 pounds of torque, it would be in the BMW 335ci class as far as being quicker. Without the torque, I would say this car is a touch behind BMW in the performance area, but it makes up for it by being less expensive and I would say more reliable than the BMW. Infiniti has come a long way since my 2003 G35 coupe. If you are looking for a good looking coupe for around $40k, this car is hard to beat.  ","Good looks, nice lines and the interior is very modern. ",Take off weight to make it better balanced and add more torque for a true sports car feel.
4.75,Super sweet car,Mr spock ,09/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"This 2008 is so much better than the previous model. After 3 weeks I have to say this car with all options is almost everything I was hoping for.  Ive been driving Mustang GTs for many years so this car is so much more refined and luxurious.  The sound system and nav are excellent.  High speed (100MPH) on the highway is very well controlled and surprisingly quiet in both road and wind noise.  The power band on this engine does not come alive until you get above 3000 RPM.  Im used to lots of V8 torque, and this otherwise excellent engine just does not have that torque.  But rev it up beyond 4000 and it will pin you back nicely. ","Audio system with line input, iPod controller, built in hard drive, and compact flash port.  The interior with the Washi trim.  The exterior shape is just beautiful, better than others in this category (like 335 coupe).  So many features in this baby it staggers my mind.","Brake pedal is way too sensitive for my taste.  With all the electronic controls, how about adjustability for brake pedal force?  Voice recognition stinks.  Would love a 7sp manual with twin turbos for torque :)"
4.875,Good blend of luxury and sport,J Carman ,09/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car drives and handles like my 350Z did, but has more amenities and creature comforts for more enjoyable long-distance drives. I don't find the automatic lagging, nor do I think the shifts are harsh. Moving the lever into 'sport' mode makes a difference, too :) Went from a 2006 Audi A6 to this, mainly for the fun quotient. Has all the tech goodies from the A6, and then some.","The iPod connection gives you complete access to all your songs/playlists from the steering wheel, as well as on the touch display. All song titles/artists displayed. Nav system works as well as my Garmin c550.","The address book will only import your contacts if the phone can 'push' them via bluetooth. Not many phones can, including my iPhone.  Some nav features disabled while driving. Should tie the disable feature to the passenger airbag detector, if I have a co-pilot she can operate the nav."
5,"Fantastic, Beautiful, Fast, Refined Car",jrays ,09/14/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just picked up my 2008 G37 Journey last night.  I already have a few hundred miles on it and I absolutely am in love with this car.  It has a red exterior and black interior, with the Premium, Navigation, Technology and Sports packages.  It also came with the spoiler, splash guards and cargo net. It's a dream to drive. Quiet on the inside with a sweet exhaust note.  Even with the Sports package, it rides really well. It is a really refined and well-built car.  It has so many ""toys"" that I don't know where to start.  It's a beautiful car and it's getting a lot of attention and positive comments.  This one is destined to be a classic.  ","So many favorite features. The navigation system is great. Being able to talk to the car and control functions is astounding. The ride, responsiveness, fit and finish, and attention to detail is amazing on this car. The Active Cruise and Backup Camera work well.  Infiniti got this one right.  ","A little more room in the back seat and trunk.  Not a big deal, since we don't buy coupes for these.  Optional DRL would be nice for those of us who like them.  Also, automatic locking of the doors when the car starts moving would be an added security feature."
4.75,Great Coupe,Javier ,09/06/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"I love this car! It reacts immediately when you hit the gas. The shifting is smooth. The interior looks great. All the accessories make it perfect. It corners really well at high speeds. It looks great. Before I bought the 6 speed manual, I test drove the automatic. The automatic was a complete letdown for me. The shifting was not smooth at all and the acceleration was not there. It's night and day between manual and automatic. I can't say enough about the G37. It's simply awesome.",Instant speed and great manueverability. Bluetooth.,Cupholders. Add automatic door locking when vehicle starts rolling for added security.
4.75,Bang for the buck,scott murphy ,08/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This car absolutely has it all, power, handling, best technology, including music hard drive that is ahead of all the rest. How can you compare its competitors to a car that has more for half the money. It's a rocket with all the gadgets. Big winner.",Music hard drive.,"Sport seat could be a little wider. maybe a little more head room in the back seat, but what coupe has that anyway. "
5,G37 captures the German auto gestalt,TrueTaiChi ,08/24/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just test-drove the G37 Sport automatic. My first impression: this is the first Japanese car I've driven (I own the G35 6MT with the Brembos) that feels exactly like a German sports car. Seriously. The Sport G37 is tight and solid, with a really surprising balance of sport verve and comfort. The car really feels likes a BMW or Mercedes, but with more edge. Yet it is still distinctly Japanese in its design, if not feel. The exterior is probably the most sumptous, sophisticated sport car design out now for a production sports car. The interior is slick, with cool details, such as the outstanding brushed alum ""washi"" trim.","A true taut, refined sports car. Perfect balance of sports car rawness with carefully added refinements. External design - wow! Best nav system out there. Unique Japanese aesthetic touches. ","More space in the back - backseat and trunk are smaller than G35 coupe. More understated dash dials. Didn't test drive, but the stick in the manual appears too far from the armrest."
