4.625,Does it all. Don't leave your gas card at home. ,indydave62 ,12/30/2011,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I purchased a 2008 BMW M3 Convertible with the DCT transmission two weeks ago. It has all options except extended leather and parking sensors. This car is amazing. It's ridiculously powerful and fast. If you feel like being an F1 Driver, you can shift with the paddles, if you're feeling lazy (or commuting), you can just put it in ""D"" mode, and let the DCT do the work for you. With the convertible hardtop, the car is quiet and rattle-free. The stereo is excellent, and the seats are very adjustable, supportive and comfortable. ","-DCT transmission
-Build quality
-Engine sound and power
-Seats
-Exterior styling
-Sound system
-You don't see one on every corner
","-Gas mileage should be much better. Corvettes and Mustangs with similar power and weight get far better mileage. 
-Too easy to hit the windshield washers when trying to use the right shift paddle
-NAV system is OK, but doesn't work as well as a portable unit.
- iDrive takes a while to learn. 
-Ride quality with the 19"" wheels is a little harsh on rough roads. "
3.125,Not worth it,lindsayg ,05/06/2011,,,3,5,2,3,,5,3,1,3,"I always considered a convertible M3 as my dream car and in 2008 I went out and bought one- brand new.It was gorgeous and ""impressive"" but totally and absolutely not worth the sticker price.It had so many stupid quirks that I rarely drove it, preferring my Volvo station wagon (!).I will never again buy a BMW and I pity the poor guy who got mine when I dumped it after 2 years and only 15,000 miles.I'm glad I got the BMW bug out of my system, but it cost a lot to be cured!","Styling, inside and out.
Face it, it is a sexy car.
The leather feels like a designer purse and the outside is just beautiful- top up or down.
I DID like the hardtop convertible and the motors never failed.
The trunk space with the top up was surprisingly large and even pretty decent with the top down.
I liked all the ways you could customize your settings (once you got your BMW PhD and figured them out).
Frankly, I just liked looking at it.","Where do I begin...?
The radio stank, my Volvo's was so much better.
The GPS was abomidably bad, even with the ""upgrades"".
The dashboard computer didn't usually agree with the GPS screen's computer regarding oil level, which led to multiple trips to the dealership and wasted time.
The pairing with a phone (bluetooth) or an iPod (aux) were awful and often locked up my Blackberry and my iPod.
My computer would randomly lock up as well, which the dealer blamed on my infrequent use of the car.
I bought an expensive battery-charge-keeper unit and there was NO improvement.
They should have spent more time in R&D on their computer systems in a car that costs this much or not offered it."
3.75,Underpowered,douglas stewart ,06/18/2010,,,4,4,4,5,,1,4,4,4,"Dependable and comfortable. Fun to drive. Brakes great, handles well. But, built to keep you out of trouble. Underpowered as can be for the real enthusiast your better off building an American v8 in a muscle car. These are tame in comparison. IMO BMW built these for folks that really don't know what real power is. They are very tame. Stomp the gas and wait. Ya for yuppies it may be a little impressive but for real men its a disappointment on a high level. Forgettable power, lame. I will not buy another 1 unless they trust me not to crash it, they don't. Needs much more torque and or turbocharging. ","beautiful interior , brakes and handling . Very comfortable.","TURBO . Trust us BMW . We will try to stay out of trouble .

Materials are great, build quality is amazing. The interior is a little stale, even with the nav and extended leather. The car doesn't seem to have a ""cockpit."" The sport seats are comfortable, but not sporty feeling at all. Also-BMW PLEASE MOVE WINDOW SWITCHES BACK TO CENTER!!! No major problems...OH WAIT! They have depreciated so much it is ridiculous.  I just got $44,900 for mine.  (That was the highest of 8 dealers)  I paid $69,900 fully loaded from the factory. Only had 12K miles, no scratches, etc. WORD OF ADVICE-DO NOT BUY NEW!!!!!! Buy slightly used.","Ride quality, response, materials, ENHANCED AUDIO SYSTEM.","Seats not sporty, lack of ""M stance""....new M3 could pass as a 335 sedan or coupe, bland styling, lack of colors.

4.75,M3 Perfection,MMMMMMMM3 ,08/05/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I've always been a Porsche guy & even tried an 08 Vette for a while but a baby meant I needed a 4 door or I was sentenced to driving the wife's car all the time. I looked at the IS-F, E55, & C63 before buying the E90 M3. One drive and you'll understand. The feel, sounds, handling etc are all unbelievable. When you are done driving like you stole it, it is a very civilized cruising car for the whole family. None of the competitors come close. I honestly didn't think I'd like the M3 from reading about it as I thought it wouldn't have the torque to make me happy. I couldn't stop grinning on the test drive. Drive one and you will understand. The M3 is the best all around car on the market.","Performance, handling, perfect suspension tuning, V8 music",6sp shifter could be better. I'd like a slightly more aggressive gear ratio but Dinan's 4.10 can fix that.  Free tires for life :)?
4.75,Love my M3,Cordog ,07/22/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I have always wanted a M3 and with the introduction of the new M in 08' I couldn't have picked a better time to get one.  I decided to go with the hard top convertible to get the best of both worlds.  True coupe like design and then who could argue the experience of open roof driving.  I have invested in an amazing performance exhaust because I was a little disappointed with the stock sound... no way did it sound like a V- 8, but it sure does now!!  I also put H&R Sport lowering springs on it to give the car an even more aggressive stance at stand still and it corners even better now... if you can improve on the amazing handling it came with.","Hard top, HD radio, and aggressive styling vs non M BMW 3 series cars.",While I am somewhat used to the iDrive I wish I had waited until the 09' model came out as it has the newer system included.
4.875,Lives up to its legendary billing!,AbaundvrM3 ,01/25/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5," All it took was one 5 mile test drive to realize this is a special car that lives up to every kudo the M nameplate has earned over the years.  The 414hp pulls rapidly to the 8400 rpm redline and WOW, what music to the ears! There's NO car that sounds so perfect when running wide open down the Abaun!  It's an absolute dream to drive with perfect balance and only a hint of understeer. I'm amazed at the usability and room in this vehicle.  The interior is very comfortable and although it's a supercar I can still put the family in it to go cruising.  The trunk is large and the interior volume/space is perfect for 4 persons.  If you're looking for the ultimate car, look no more... the M3 is it!",V8 motor!  The interior is very nicely appointed and roomy although slightly understated.  The look of the car is sinister especially with the Alpine White and the carbon fiber roof... VERY SEXY!  The car is an absolute dream and is simply hard to beat because it does everything so perfectly!  ,"Being picky, maybe a little more gear than the 3.15 final ratio.  3.60 up to a 4.10 gear would turn this car into a monster and add some more torque to the ground yet would be usable/livable with the 6 spd manual or other transmissions BMW offers."
4.75,Car for all moods,Kojjan ,01/20/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"In terms of driving enjoyment this is the best car I have had. Wanted to point out the how nice it is to be able to switch from automatic mode when you feel like just cruising, to using the hand pedals when you feel like driving hard. Regardless of your mood you get best possible experience. In both situations the car handles great, and is fun. Having a cab that adds an additional dimension. So the new M3 Cab is the best possible combination of fun, diversity and quality of driving I have ever seen.","The gear box, engine, USB for music, looks.",
4.875,Elegant Supercar,jwalker-Ohio ,01/10/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Drove a 2009 Porsche 911 with A/M before I drove the M3 6spd.  The 911 didn't impress me. The M3 blew me away.  Got it will all the options and brushed aluminum. It is very comfortable.  Takes a little time to get used to shifting the manual. You can tell a major difference from M mode and regular mode.  Fuel economy is almost the same in both so I usually just leave it in M. In M it is a rocket, in regular my 4-runner accelerates faster. Icontrol is easy to use and they seem to have thought of everything and put it in the right place.","Stare factor. Several people have nearly wrecked their cars trying to stare at mine.

Have had a 2007 P911 turbo, a bmw 645, and another P911S cab in the last 4 years, but this seems to hold its own with the turbo and beat the rest. More comfortable the the Porsche with incredible handling. M3 has satellite radio, something Porsche did not offer until 2009 and then at a very steep option price.

Love the MDrive option because I drive this car daily in the summer and I don't need to spill my coffee at every stop light. Love the IDrive. I think the IDrive has gotten a bad rap from the non-computer literate generation out there. The car is simply everything good I wanted in a car, power, style, luxury, safety, performance, it's all there.","Awesome sound system, great power, the sound of the exhaust during acceleration is addicting.

The DCT transmission makes this car and I highly recommend getting it.  The car's fit and finish is perfect. Everything is flush no creaks or rattles.

M6 and M5 are similar, and some would say in their own class. Yes and no, the M3 seems to be much more agile and nimble, which gives the impression of being just as fast if not faster. Interior is the same as any new BMW car, not that great, but better than the likes of MB or P-cars. Back seat is way better than 911 p-car, but still pathetic. Overall, I think this car actually has some value in it and in today's day and age is affordable for the supercar-like performance and feel.

5,M3 Sedan,Guitardrew ,06/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love this car. I have two young children which means that I need a car with 4 doors. I have owned a '98 E36 M3 sedan - which was fun and a '02 E39 M5 - which was fantastic (apart from the oil leaks & quirky electronic failures) both of which made me an avid M fan. However, when it came time to replace the M5 there was no 4 door M series available. So, I switched to Audi's S4. I was very surprised at how good the Audi was but it did not give me the same driving enjoyment as a BMW.  When it came time to change the Audi I looked at the M5 and the M3 sedan. I liked the M5 but I could not see what I was getting for the extra $30K. The M3 is a perfect solution for me and my family... we love it!","Brakes, engine (and exhaust noise at 4-5,000rpm), iDrive, comfort access, iPod integration, M button (so much easier than the two fingered salute on the E39 M5), phone integration, comfortable ride in normal mode and acceleration!","Nothing critical but it does need a larger gas tank, addition of European style rear fog lights for use in heavy rain, back up camera, Acura style voice commands for navigation, headlamp washers"

Not the fastest car out, but the balance of power, ride and awesome handling make it a fantastic package.

The engine noise, throttle response, the handling, the 19"" wheels with the billet brakes. They made everything in the car functional nothing cosmetic.
