Soon after, the electric door locks failed - would not stay locked. Replaced under warranty. March 2012 the drain tubing from the sunroof came loose and ended up filling the passenger footwell with water. Self-diagnosed and repaired with a bit of silicone putty and super glue. New tires at 77k. Routine oil changes and brake fixes - but one time in North Carolina the front calipers wouldn't fully release. $200 to re-build the calipers. At 85k, replaced timing chain and intake/exhaust solenoid valves @ $1500. Around 88k, the service air bag light came on. The dealer has told me the seat-heater melted the passenger sensor module and both need to be replaced @ $1100. Currently unresolved. Now the good stuff: This is the best car I've ever had. I've found myself wanting more power at times, especially when climbing mountains across the country, but the 2.4 is sufficient. Great mileage, also. I've been getting about 25 mpg combined with mixed city/highway driving. Seats are totally comfortable - 7,200-mile cross-country road trip @29 mpg with zero complaints. The front doors do open a little bit far, but they have three stages where they stop. #2 is a good opening point. It's still a little bit difficult to tell exactly where the back of the car is when backing in somewhere, but I've gotten used to it. Not looking forward to the labor-intensive process when a headlight goes out, but I changed foglamps myself without issue. I would buy it again (but I would get the V6).",,

The seals were covered under the 5 yr 100k powertrain warranty and the rest was under the extended warranty that came with the car. So far, it's great.

If I could get rid of this car, I would never buy another chevrolet car, truck, etc. It looks good, but it drives so rough. You feel every little bump. This car has been in the shop several times and they couldn't figure out what's wrong with it. Whenever it rains, my floor becomes soaking wet on the driver side.

I will never buy another Chevy.","I do like the style of the car, the color and the interior. Everybody thought I had the inside customized when I first got it. That was one of the reason I got it.

That equates to about 32 mpg which is 6 mpg higher than the 26 mpg rating. The 92 mile trip was 95 percent freeway with the cruise set at 70 mph.  This car also gets lots of looks!",XM radio and 6 CD player Performance Handling Fuel Economy,"Maybe a softer or padded material on the interior door panels.  Some might want a center rear console, but I prefer the fold down rear seat back rests which the car has."
5,"Incredible value, fun, and built strong",Bryan ,02/03/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I am thrilled with my Malibu LT.  I got bored easily with Accord, Toyotas, Jetta, etc.  Malibu is an excellent traveling car - rides securely, corners great; no bobble-head ride like in the 2009 Corolla XLE (same price!).  It is quiet, with an excellent stereo (you can enjoy dance music) and cold A/C - not like the weak A/C on many cars.  When I needed to tow a U-Haul, I bought a hitch and wiring for my Malibu - it's a secure and stable tower.  That is because Malibu is a stout, well-engineered vehicle that has the extra braking strength, and suspension capability built-in.  The interior looks more expensive than it is - same outside. I couldn't find a better sedan for the money. Pittsburgh won the 2009 Super Bowl - could they be better?  The Malibu is a seriously great car.  My family and friends like it too - even though they drive Nissan Altima, 3 series BMW, and Cadillac CTS.  Did I mention the fuel mileage is good?  Hint:  Premium perks it up if you're in the mood.","Excellent handling, compliant ride, cold A/C, quiet and 'tight' body, excellent engine and transmission (suprisingly quick 4-cylinder - V6 isn't necessary for me) good sized trunk.  It is solid and sturdy-built. Feels and demonstrates that it is over- engineered and not chintzed out like some cars.",

For the past 11 years I have bought imports because of what Chevrolet was making (Cavalier, Beretta, etc.). I have been needing a car to replace my Mazda. I first naturally started with a Mazda 3, which had looked good in the past. This car was gutless and did not really get great mileage. I also tried some of the other imports and was still not impressed. I finally tried the Chevrolet Malibu and I liked how it felt.  The fit and finish was nice, the ride was not harsh and not too soft. I really enjoyed the stereo and the steering wheel controls. I am a finally proud to own a Chevrolet again!",I like the lines of the Malibu and it appears that a lot of thought was given to the interior to make it top of the line. It is also very quiet. I also like the mileage which I watch very carefully and I am averaging a little over 30 mpg. ,I hope that Chevrolet tries to keep at the front of the line and keeps investing in R&D to accomplish this. Hopefully they have learned that the American public can and will shop else where if they decide to sit on their laurels like they have done so often in the past.

Its cockpit feel wraps you into the car. The dashboard layout and lighting is very cool. Very quiet and smooth ride. Everything is at your finger tips. The look is very impressive. I tried the Camry earlier in the year and it did not come close, especially the ride. The in and out of the seats is a bit hard, but once you're in, get ready for the ride. This is the best Malibu yet, a lot of rights, a little tweaking maybe needed. ",The V6 power is awesome! The handling and quiet ride. The bells and whistles are nice!,"The big downer, the fuel economy. Access in and out of the drivers seat could be better. The older Malibu Max leather seats were more comfortable.

The dealership owner, a friend of mine, knew I was looking and he delivered this car to my driveway. After test driving this car on the highway I fell in love with it.  I look forward to driving it everyday. I love its pickup and go, I love the XM radio, the moon roof, the OnStar, the look and feel of the car.

Very quiet on road, fan loud, AC/defrost/heater great.  Difficult to back up, can't see how close you are to objects behind. For the money a good buy for a family of 4. It's not my kind of car but at the time it was the only thing I could get and I did not make a bad choice, all and all.   ","XM radio, remote lock/trunk, gas mileage.

I am most impressed with how quiet this car is. Tire/road noise is less than Honda.

5,Best in it's class,Bowtiefan ,11/22/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We just traded the van in for an 08 LTZ, Spring Package Malibu. For its class, this is one nice ride. The mating of the Spring Package 4 cylinder to the 6 speed tranny gives the light car plenty of pep and almost as much MPG as one of those compact jobies. If you have to have 0 to 60 in under 5 seconds, then go pay for it in a class that costs a lot more. Beating the guy beside you away from the toll plaza is fun, but over rated. We could have purchased a vehicle in the class above the Malibu, but for what my family finds appealing, it wasn't worth the 20k plus difference. In this class, this car has the nicest exterior lines, smooth acceleration, and very appealing interior luster. ","Down right pleasant to look at. Very comfortable and fun to drive. Great gas mileage, Love the interior on the LTZ, nice material and lay out. Love all the bells and whistles that come standard on the LTZ, that would cost a lot more in the class above.

I do notice this car handles very well and if you are not careful you will be speeding constantly. You really don't notice the road noise or engine rev. This car is really loaded with options for the price.","The ride in this car is firm but not jarring, it just feels solid, quiet too. Handling is great, I would like to get this on a test track just to see how far I could push it. ",Entering and exiting the drivers door is difficult if you are 6+ feet tall.

The ride is quiet and the road manners are excellent. The interior is beautiful. I have the black interior with the faux wood trim and it's everything and more.

Very comfortable ride, very good mileage, excellent interior and awesome deluxe sound system. Truly the best car that I have ever purchased. Only concern is the electric power steering, which started jerking and acting eratic at about 10,000 miles while on an extended 2,500 mile trip. It took 2 trips to dealer to get steering problem corrected.  Hopefully this is an isolated problem and not a reoccuring problem similar to earlier Malibu's with electric steering problems.   ",Premium audio sound system is fantastic. Mileage is about as advertised at 30-31 highway and combined 24. Computer readout  on cars condition & performance is great.

Comfortable and quiet and smooth but not as quiet or smooth as the LT we tested at the same time. I think it's the tires - LTZ sportier but if an absolutely smooth quiet cruiser is what you want, I'd recommend the LT. Mileage isn't great but is what it said we'd get. 17 city upper 20's on highway (at mostly 80) ","XM radio worth the extra money. I don't have a lot of CDs just floating around the front of the car.

The pick-up in the Malibu is not that great (but keep in mind, we got the 4-cyl!), but the fuel economy more than makes up for it.  We've been averaging over 30 mpg, combined highway and city (about 50/50), and we easily get 35 mpg on the highway. The car is fairly comfortable.

I previously owned an 02 MonteCarlo SS and loved it. My Malibu has a lot of the same luxury features. The 1st thing is the fuel economy, much less than advertised & less than my SS(though still early - only gone thru 2.5 tanks/gas) and I'm still learning how it drives compared to my Monte.  The 2nd annoying thing is the cruise control. Monte had such smooth cruise control, going up and down hills, Malibu is a little obnoxious when the cruise is engaged (revvs up loudly when adjusting speeds uphill- again, it's early.","Heated, comfy leather seats, black granite paint (sparkly), storage (lots of it!) nice stereo & lots of safety features.  It's beautiful; get lots of looks from other drivers, and peppy to drive.","Worried about how the ""suede"" seats will clean when needed.

4,Should have leased it instead,kb ,09/05/2008,,,4,5,5,4,,4,3,3,4,"The styling of the car is impressive as it has the lines of a much more expensive car. The ride has been disappointing.  Very bumpy and not driver friendly at highway speeds. I was willing to overlook the firm ride if highway stability was solid but that's just not the case. The transmission has a tendency to shift up at low RPM (1K-2K) leaving normal acceleration feeling tired. Although, the 6cyl is very responsive if you step on it or use the paddle shifter instead.  ",Exterior styling and color (sandstone metallic). Interior leather is good quality with the imitation wood trim is nice.

The Malibu is the first car I have owned in many years.  I have had no problems so far. Miss my truck but at this point would not want to get rid of the Malibu.   ","I really like the fit and finish both inside and out. The dash & driver controls all seem to make sense and are easy to use.  Radio w/IPod jack are good.

I am 6'3"", so the telescopic steering column and moveable foot pedals are a huge plus (I even needed to move the seat forward a bit). The V- 4 is quite powerful, and very quiet. The included features on the 2LT for the price gave me reverse sticker shock. I only went for the optional sunroof and premium floor mats.","Driver's legroom. Quiet ride and tight steering. Automatic headlight system. The sound system rocks. The trunk is huge, and there are many compartments in the front row. The remote start and heated front seats will be a plus in the winter.","Although the interior is leather, the magazine holders on the seat backs is a cheaper mesh-like material. The cupholders on the front doors could probably only hold a 12 oz. can of soda. No bluetooth exists in the car since GM probably wants users to pay for the OnStar service."

I got it in black granite with the coco cashmere interior. This car looks so sleek. I test drove the Accord V6 and Camry XLE and SE. I had no intension of buying a Chevy but with my last car being a Camaro and it having been reliable for the 9 years I had it I figured I would give a Chevy a test drive at the least. The car certainly kills its competitors as far as appearance. It handled better than the accord and camry and the Malibu LTZ was over 4 grand cheaper than a similarly equipped Camry or Accord.  Driving down the road I don't feel like Camry #9999 ,"Love the way the car handles, and the power is great too.  It handles like a sports car but has the look of a sleek, expensive European Audi or BMW.  I love the two-tone interior as well. This car is unbelievable for the money. Trunk size is good, and rear comfort is roomy as well.","Less hard plastics on interior of doors, dual climate control and memory seats.

It has all the things you see in Toyoya, Honda, Nissan, etc. It's a mid size car but gets Honda cCvic gas mpg and is very quiet unlike the Honda. Toys are a different matter. I think they are a little better but this is subjective. I ride in both models (Malibu/Camry). Car fan is loud when set on 3 or higher. AC is OK, not great but gets the job done. I've had better.

If I ride it gently on the weekends I could get better, but that's usually when I have my fun.  Instantaneous mpg is at 30mpg if I set cruise control on the highway! The ride is smooth and quiet, better than my dad's luxury import. For a mid-size sedan it gets an awful lot of looks and compliments. It doesn't quite satisfy my appetite for speed/style, but I'm not willing to pay for gas on a Mustang's V8. ","The V6. The tap-shift controls on the wheel, effectively making this automatic a simple manual. Satellite radio. The sleek wood finish on the interior. Leather wrapped shifter. iPod jack. The blue lights illuminating the door handles so you can find them in the dark. The interior is insane.","Although it looks incredible, it's still a bit too ""family sedan"" from the front for my taste. The V6 kicks, but Dodge Avenger sounds so much nicer on  startup (but lacks the beautiful interior work).  Huge blind spot on rear passenger side because of roof design (I'll deal)."

Prior to my retirement I was averaging 26mpg in crappy Washington, DC commuter traffic, excellent! The interior is very classy and the outside is a head turner.

The Malibu has a great interior, ride, performance, handling, build quality, and the reliablity should be good. Check out the Motortrend Car of the Year Award (Jan '08). It's almost as good as the $43,000 CTS and I think it should have won the COTY award. I recomend buying the LTZ model for a few thousand more.

The two-toned leather interior is great, also I have the Dark Red exterior color. This color really sets off the chrome trim that the car has. Everywhere I go, people compliment my car.

However I don't believe this will happen with Malibu due to all the advertisement. The car gets lots of looks and people think it's a more expensive vehicle. Love the control you have of the car. I love power so it's not quite enough but for a person who isn't a car buff like myself it's more than plenty.  I would buy another one. Tried to get my spouse to get one but they didn't want to have the same car.

The Malibu gets great highway mileage (30 mpg at 75 mph) but is dismal in the city. In normal city traffic with stop and go congestion, I am averaging only 18 mpg, a downright terrible number for a new midsize sedan. If you are planning on buying a Malibu LS mainly for the city, I recommend you test drive one first to see the mileage. Pickup on the highway is poor (especially when the vehicle is packed) but OK for normal driving. Just don't try to pass trucks on the interstate. Besides the city mileage and pickup, my only other complaint is the poor radio reception.","Good ergonomics for the radio and air conditioning; free XM radio for 3 months, attractive interior and exterior; plenty of storage space throughout the cabin; auxiliary input for mp3 player",A 5 speed automatic for the LS engine; more levels for the windshield wiper and air conditioning; improved radio reception; add key access to trunk

My criteria was to get a car that was comfortable, fun to drive and gets good fuel economy. The 4 cyl has plenty of power and that power is smooth. Initially I was concerned about getting a 4sp auto when others offer a 5 or 6sp with a 4cyl but this trans shifts so smoothly and works so well with the power generated from this engine. This car is so quiet, very little road noise.  Test drive this car before you buy, you'll be glad you did.","Ride, looks, excellent design both inside and out. OnStar and XM radio are great also.

We were in the midst of some kind of biker rally on this road trip, and there was a rock band playing at one of the stops.

Looks great, rides great, couldn't be happier.","Added our car to our Verizon Family Plan for $9.99 a month. It is just like adding a line, look up Verizon Wireless with OnStar.

It rides like a much bigger car than it is and is as quiet as my previous Cadillac. And recently I have had the opportuniy to take it on a few road trips and have gotten over 30 mpg on each trip. The car is amazing both in ride, handling and power. The seats are comfortable and easy on the back.

5,Kudos to you Chevrolet,Matt ,05/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I looked at several cars before buying including CTS, Lexus GS350, Acura TL, Honda and Maxima. I test drove this one and felt the others weren't worth the extra money. LTZ version is awesome. Everything about it was well done, high quality materials on interior, great engine and ride, good looks and you absolutely cannot beat the price. GM did an awesome job on the redesign of this car. I honestly feel it is comparable to many higher priced imports. Standard features makes for an easy purchase. I'm extremely happy to say that I bought an American car. I strongly encourage all potential buyers to test drive this car before purchasing a Honda, Acura, Nissan or other. You'll be pleasantly surprised","Lots of leg room, front and back. Looks, engine, ride, XM radio - everything about the car is A+. Based on pricing of other cars and what you get with the LTZ you would think this should be $35,000+.",

GM did everything right with this one. The comfort while driving to the spaciousness of the vehichle is great! I have a 4 month old son, and the space is definitely needed. With raising gas prices the Malibu was a much better bet then the Tahoe I was originally looking at. With this being the 3rd Chevy that I have owned..Cobalt SS, and TrailBlazer SS...I'm still completly satisfied with Chevys! For the price range there is nothing more that I can ask for. I have the sunroof, heated seats, remaote start, plenty of places to put stuff. I couldnt ask for anything more.","Love the 6 speed manual paddle shift. Being that I have a child now, and its not very comfortable to put him in the Cobalt SS. The manual shifting on the Malibu is very nice!",

Traded in a TrailBlazer and getting good returns as far as better mileage.  1LT with sunroof and power convenience package, Sandstone color - very sharp!  Smooth ride, quiet engine, decent mileage so far (22-25 mpg in mixed driving). Eye-catching interior and every feature you might need. Also looked at Sonata and Altima and this was the best choice for me. Only minuses so far are turning radius (seems like the TrailBlazer could turn tighter), no rear seat armrest, and small trunk opening.  I'm 6'2"" and it took a little while to find a comfortable seat postion but no compaints now.","Looks, quiet & smooth ride, fuel economy, standard features.","Tighter turning radius, rear seat armrest."

5,Big Bang for your Buck!,Nelson ,05/25/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Just bought my Chevy Malibu LTZ.  Had a Cadillac CTS-V, but due to the cost of gas, had to sacrifice it. This car is awesome.  It is extremely quiet, those acoustic windows actually do help a lot. A better value and performer than all the expensive competitors.

I had a Chevy TrailBlazer which I also loved, but traded it for a Dodge Caliber due to gas mileage. I hated giving up my luxury of the TrailBlazer and truly missed it.  After buying the Malibu, I don't miss my Blazer as much. The Malibu has a feel of luxury without the price tag. I love the looks, the handling, and the comfort. The only thing I can say I don't like about the Malibu are the blind spots, but I know they're there and just need to be a little more careful. I would highly recommend this vehicle.","Seating comfort, auto vertical height (I'm short), interior and exterior design, and the standard features you normally pay extra for on other vehicles.","More available accessories, such as a locking gas cap, especially in today's economy."

I was looking at Altima and Sonata, but when I drove the Malibu, it was no contest. I can't believe the difference between this car and the 2007. Unbelievably quiet and comfortable.  Interior is very nice - as good as many cars costing much more. I have filled up twice and got 30mpg and 31mpg with mostly highway commute miles. Plenty of power for me. Exterior styling is beautiful. Clean lines, great looks, everything goes together well. With so many standard features, I couldn't believe the price. The last GM product I bought was in 1988. I'm glad to see GM is back in the game - and winning the game in my opinion. ","XM, fuel economy, styling, ride, comfort, and price",A little more travel on the tilt/telescope steering wheel.

This is a new feature for the Malibu. Now you have great looks with the LTZ and a great fuel economy. Plenty of power and acceleration with the 4. I have owned a Toyota Camry and this car has it beat handsdown. No wonder the Chevolet dealers can't keep them in stock! ,"4 cylinder engine with the 6 speed transmission, especially in the LTZ.

The Malibu is sporty to drive, yet has plenty of room for my family of 4. I drive 200 miles a day and average 29 miles per gallon at 75 mph with criuse and the 3.6L engine. The ride is excellent and quiet. The sound system rocks and with the onstar phone I can pay more attention to the driving. The only thing I can say needs improvement is the side to side leg room could be greater, but again I am used to driving a crew cab. Overall a great car.

It handles the road very well, even plows through the deep snow, I was concerned I might spend a lot of time in the ditch. It did great with the snow!  Needs to have fog lights as a standard feature to help with the poor visibility of the low beam headlamps.","Adjustable pedals, XM radio","The headlights on low beam, can't see the road very well at night or on a rainy dark night. This is a huge complaint of mine. The drink holders in the front are a poor design. The second holder in the center console is pretty useless w/o open the storage console.

5,Fantastic,jnb2008 ,05/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Overall this car is absolutely fantastic. I have had it for three weeks and it is very pleasing. I marked a 9 on my fuel economy only because I went from a Neon. This is a bigger car, but I would prefer a little better city fuel economy (about 22 stop and go).  It's not too bad though.  When you get on the highway it's 30-31.  My fiance completely loves this car as well. He wishes he could have it. This is my first brand new car and I am in love.

Not to mention, I have never had a car so luxurious (and I don't even have the model that's been supped-up). The basic model is already equipped as a luxury car.

I'm sorry Toyota and Nissan there's nothing to compare.

4.875,Love my 2008 LTZ Malibu,Cbrus ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,We purchased this car in late 2007 after considering the Altima and Camry for several months. We just fell in love with the styling of this car and value for the money. Once we test drove it there was no turning back. We have the V6 LTZ - which I'd say is the only way to go with this car -- and so many features are standard. This car handles like a dream and we get so many compliments on the looks. In my town we are still part of the very few who have this car and it seems to turn heads wherever we go.,Handling. Speed of car. Interior looks. Quiet ride. Low profile wheels & tires. OnStar & XM radio. Heated seats. Remote starter. Generous trunk room.,"I wish the radio integrated with my cell phone via bluetooth. I also wish that the cup holders, storage on door panels and glove box were a bit larger. Wish for an arm rest to divide the back seat (helps with feuding siblings). Finally, wish the gas mileage was a tad better on the LTZ. "
5,2 month follow-up on initial review,autofan2 ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Here is my review after 2 months/2000 miles. Car is rock solid; paddle shifters are effective and make driving fun again, even in a midsize sedan. Turn-by-turn Nav is not bad, but glad it's free for now. Gas mileage has settled around 23.5 mpg in mixed driving. Driver comfort is excellent with all the available adjustments. Extra storage areas really come in handy.  Remote start is a great feature, but key fob has not worked a few, unrepeatable times. I have no real need for sunroof; would definitely buy this car again w/rear power pkg.","Paddle shifters. Smooth, powerful V-6. Comfortable, heated seats. Excellent stereo w/XM. Respectable mileage on regular fuel. Remote start. Exterior styling w/18"" wheels, dual exhaust, profile. Hands- free phone service, OnStar, navigation (free for a year). Two-tone interior","I think that on the LTZ, all current options should be standard.  Rear power pack/sunshade and sunroof should be part of the ""premium"" trim line. A center armrest for the rear seat is badly needed. Would like for GM to offer matching, OEM aftermarket armrest that matches OEM materials. "
5,A Pleasant Surprise,bwia ,03/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The Malibu is a fun car to drive. Coming from a Volvo I was reluctant to even consider a domestic. Then I test drove the Malibu and I was hooked. I really preferred the LTZ but the mileage at 17 mpg city is not great so I bought the LS and I was pleasantly surprised with its zippy performance.  The car resplendent inside and out. With the two-tone cocoa and cashmere after market leather we installed the LS looks as good as, if not better, than the LTZ. Neighbors and friends are jealous. They cant believe the luxury features on this car for less than $21,000 (leather included).  Oh, I smoked an Acura TL  that brought a pleasing and satisfying smile to my wifes face. It was almost orgasmic.",The XM radio and OnStar are great features. I have already received an OnStar diagnostic email that says that my tire pressure in the right front at 28 psi is under-inflated and should be brought up to the recommended 30 psi. Wow! isnt technology great? ,I have no negatives except that I wished I had a little more oomph from the standard stereo.

This time, I can say that they definitely got it right and can compete with Accord and Camry. The ride is better than Camry and more luxurious than Accord. Fits and finishes are at par with Japanese cars. The real problem with American car companies is that they are doing the same thing over and over again, producing craps but not this time. Honda Fit 1.5L gets 30MPG and this 2.4 Malibu is far better than Fit or Civic or Accord. See it for yourself and go take a test drive. I'd highly recommend this car to those who are looking at Japanese imports. Kudos to Chevy.",Luxury ride. Interior layout. Exterior styling. Fuel economy.  Feels a lot more expensive than Camry and Accord. Fits and finishes.,"Image. American cars have lousy image. Those who drive American cars are looked upon by import drivers like retards.

I love the night lighting in the cabin and the enclosed cup holders. The movable arm rest was a nice surprize. This car had some great designers as they thought of everything.

But you can't take the luxury out of a person, so I looked long and hard to find a car I wanted.  And this car is it!  It's a real joy to drive - very comfortable, quiet, and handles beautifully. The front seats seem to envelop you and the lumbar support is nice. The sound system is just as nice as my Denali's 9-speaker Bose system.

If your looking at a midsize car, and don't feel like being Accord/Camry no. 4574 on your block, this is a good buy.  Even if your deadset on the Honda, I'd step into a Chevy dealer, if only to find out what else is out there.

I can't really say a favorite feature, I really like most of the car.","Lots of people would like navigation, but one thing I would like, and really ought to be added is a back up sensor.

The leather seats cradle you like you're the most important person on earth. The cabin noise is so quiet you can use your inside voices at 75 mph on crummy northwest interstates.

The 3.6L V6 is very powerful yet maintains an average 25 MPG for my combined city/highway driving in the Seattle area. I get the same attention as the Mercedes that surround me!,It wouldn't hurt anything but the price tag if GM would add a little more cushion and leather to the interior door panels.

The build quality, comfort level, appearance, and amenities make for a great package.  They've done their research and took the time to put out something that wasn't thrown together.

My last one was 6 and I can barley tell the difference in the pick up. The gas milage is much better too. I love the XM radio and the OnStar which I did not have before. The controls for the radio on the steering wheel are nice and the hands free phone service. My car seat fits well in the back and leaves plenty of room for two more people to sit. The trunk holds a lot and is easy to load. I love my new Malibu,"Smooth ride, I enjoy the heated seats and the remote starter. It warms the car up for you in the winter.

They built on this with no shortage of great features and amenities, in a package with style and grace. Minute details such as the door position stops, the trunk lid mechanism, the tiny lamps inside the door handles, tiny Chevy logos in the lights, all add up to a car that delights like no other.

On the other hand, the TapShift rarely seems to come in handy.

4.75,Malibu Challenges the Imports,Mark Davis ,01/03/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"My new 2008 Malibu 2LT with the 3.6L V-6 is truly a standard-bearer for GM. I was not considering purchasing a domestic car until driving this amazing automobile.  This car boasts 252 h.p. coupled with a versatile six-speed automatic that has quick, sure shifts and propels you quickly from zero to sixty.  I've owned Nissan's and Honda's and this is just as solid with marked improvement in quality control, performance and materials.  My wife has a BMW X-3 and 525-I and this car compares favorably to those vehicles which are twice the price.  I love the XM and OnStar which only adds to the incredible value in this sports sedan. Chevy hits a home-run and levels the paying field.","XM radio (3 mos. free trial), OnStar (free service for 1 yr. with turn-by- turn navigation), great seats, beautiful interior design and layout, powerful V-6, excellent workmanship. This, in my opinion, is the best looking sport-sedan design in the 23K- 30K range which, is unique and distinctive.",Improve / upgrade door panel materials.
3.875,Get the V-6  with standard steering ,steve ,01/01/2008,,,4,4,5,4,,2,4,4,4,Test drove the lt1 and found it to be a fantastic deal with only one flaw. The electric steering on this car is not right. It seems to over steer for every correction the driver makes and thus creating a constant moving of the wheel to keep a straight line. The electric steering definitely needs some fixing here and I doubt that gm is going to jump on that for this model. Best bet is to get the v6 with the standard hydro steering. ,All,Steering
4.875,Buy American!,bossnj1 ,12/30/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Many of us have been waiting for an American car that is built with quality craftsmanship, superior performance, and smart styling. Be assured that the day has arrived- the Malibu is the real deal. I traded my '01 VW ""New"" Passat, and while I loved that car, it became very expenisve to maintain and was less than reliable. This car handles very similar (may even be better), has 60 more horsepower, and has similar quality feel and smart styling- all for +$2,000 less than I paid for my VW 7 years ago!! This car has lively acceleration, is very comfortable and quiet, and handles extremely well. Couple that with very smart, modern styling, an afordable price and you have a mid-size leader!","Excellent interior and exterior styling; smooth, powerful VVT engine; manual shift option; quality construction and solid feel; good sound system with XM 6 CD changer and OnStar for 1 year. The two tone Brick/Black leather really makes a statement. Finally the best feature- American pride!!",Fuel economy could be improved- my car is new (350 miles)- I'm getting about 21 MPG.
4.75,Love It!,Momo ,12/29/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I did a great deal of research on several makes and models.  I was able to load up the Malibu for thousands of dollars less than what I would have paid for the Altima, Accord or Camry.  I feel like I have plenty of room for my family of 5.  I was amazed at how much leg room there is in the back seat.  I wouldn't hesitate putting 2 adults in the back seat.  I waited for the Mailibu to hit the show room floor before I orded one.  I wanted to make sure the quality of the interior met my expectation.  I was concered that the low sticker price meant low quality.  I was very impressed with the quality and ordered the car right away. ","I love the heated seats, stereo and 12 months of free OnStar service.  I also really like the quick (as in really fast) and quiet ride.  There is very little wind or road noise.  The car just looks great inside and out.  I love all the details.  Chevrolet did a fantastic job with this car.",The side view mirror adjuster should be with in arms reach.  The button for the heated seat is in an odd location and difficult to see. The rear window needs a windshield wiper.  I would have liked the titanium interior but it wasn't an option with the Red exterior.  That was a bummer.
4.875,Impressive,Bill ,12/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"We had to order the specific car we wanted since none of the nearby dealers had an LTZ in Amber Bronze. It took only 4 weeks for the car to arrive and even though we have only put a few hundred miles on the vehicle, we absolutely love it. The cabin is so quiet and the ride so smooth that I can't believe we are in a mid sized car. If this car is as reliable as my 2005 Impala, which has 53,000 miles and has never had a thing done to it, then we have made an excellent decision for our second car. I cannot judge the fuel economy yet as I have not had a chance to put it on the road for an extended drive. This will happen though in January when we will take it to Miami.","Styling inside and out, quietness of the inside, overall build quality",Arm rest in the rear seat
4.375,New Malibu Surprises,JSaggio ,12/25/2007,,,5,5,5,4,,4,4,4,4,"Love cars but not an ""autophile"". Was surprised by materials and fit/finish of the interior/exterior on Malibu; quality materials well executed.  Drove 200 miles first day; city, freeway, ortega highway at night; satisfied with ride, handling and power. Ride is quieter than expected, more power than expected and more oversteer/pitch/roll than expected. It's no BMW but neither is the msrp.  To me the int/ext looks better than Accord but not Mercedes. The ride/handling compare to Accord but not Merc. Quality seems as good or better than  both.  I'm amazed with Malibu for the price..10k less cash but not car compared to Merc.

4.875,I Love It!,jalcoplumb ,12/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,The 250hp feels great. It can get out of its own way. I love the TAP shift. It is lots of fun. I am getting around 20.5mpg with a good mix of highway and stop and go. (My lead foot does not help)  When I get a little crazy it gets into the 18mpg range.  It holds the road well in the rain and it did well last week in a dusting of snow. Curious to see how it does in a good snow storm.  From what I have read the Goodyear tires were not rated well for snow.  Fit and finish are great.  The car is quiet.  I have driven with the radio off and had it around 100 and was amazed at how quiet it is inside.   Acceleration and passing at highway speed is very good even in automatic. ,"I love the TAP shifters, climate control, remote start, OnStar and two- tone interior.  The stereo rocks as well.",A USB interface on the radio would be nice.
5,"Still new, but lovin' it so far!",Kiah ,12/11/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Over the past 15 months, I went from a 2004 Honda Accord coupe to a 2007 Chevy Tahoe to the 2008 Malibu. I loved my Tahoe, but with gas prices at $3 + I couldn't afford the 11 mpg I was averaging for much longer. I traded it for the Malibu and although I miss the room in the Tahoe, the Malibu certainly provides all that I need with an 8-year-old son and a 5-month-old daughter. Great handling, nice smooth ride, and really nice looking straight from the factory. So far I am extremely pleased with my decision to trade the ""hoe"" in for the ""bu"", if anything changes, I'll be sure to update you! Happy Holidays!","TapShift, unique interior with the two-toned leather in the LTZ, heated seats, rear window shade, rear power package (includes 110-volt AC adapter with three-prong outlet), remote start, power adjustable pedals","I can only find two complaints so far, the small trunk opening makes it a bit difficult to get a full size stroller in and out and the control for the outside mirrors is a little far away. They are on the A pillar in the Malibu and in most cars they are in same location with window controls. "
5,2008 Malibu ,pierre carton ,12/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Interior is novel, only seen in very high cost vehicles. Can hold 4, 230lbs adults comfortably with leg room in rear seating.  Exterior is extremly sharp, excellent paint and tight seems. Windows developed to reduce cabin noise. Exterior lights very attractive and new. Doors shut with good sound meaning well built. Blinkers built into front fenders for warning other vehicle on road of lane changes and turns.  Air bags in sides of car a plus for my 16 year old driver. Plus extra steel cage built into cage of vehicle. Probably built safer than any car at or near it's price range.  17inch wheels make this car look sharp.",,

This is my first new Chevy purchase, I looked at Pontiac, Ford, Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, as a buyer this was the most bang for the buck. What a great car for the money.

5,Well worth the wait,car nut ,12/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Best American car that has come out in years. I have owned a lot of Japenese cars, and this Malibu surpasses them all. GM really has it going on with the style. I have been following this car on the internet for almost a year and it really has lived up to all of the hype and the reviews. It seems to be a well thought out and well crafted car. Seems solid, looks good and does not feel cheap and plasticky like American cars of the past. Took alot of homework on my part to buy this car, and I am glad that I did!  Proud to say now, that I am glad that I bought American!  Way to go, GM!",Looks are great. Feels nice and solid.

5,First Impressions,Bob ,11/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,This is a great car. In the past I have been very sceptical about american vehicles. I have been a loyal Toyota Camry owner for many years. This car won me over. The fuel economy on the sticker states 17 city 26 hwy. I got 36 hwy at 65 mph with the a/c on for 70 miles. I got 27 hwy at 80 mph.,The interior is very comfortable.

Great for being new, hope to get better. Interior room is very good and trunk is large. Planning a trip to Florida in the spring and I think the Malibu will be coming along. If you are looking for a new vehicle you must put the Malibu on your list and you won't be disappointed.",The best features are all the standard features.

Now GM is following suit with the new Malibu. Build quility is definitely above the Camry and design is also well ahead of most competition.If one thing stands out it's how quiet the cabin is. The 6 cylinder engine is smooth and powerful and the paddle shifters work well holding gears without the kicking down in most cases.Interior room is good still a little smaller inside than Fusion or Camry however much nicer layout.

I used to own a Camry; however, as long as GM continues to build quality cars like the Malibu I will continue to buy Chevrolets. The styling and handling of this car doesn't compare to anything else I have driven. This car is far superior in all aspects and a great value as well.

It has the largest rear legroom we have seen so far in it's class. Even more than the Impala due to the way the front seats are constructed with an indentation in the back of the seat. Very quiet interior. We went with the 4cyl instead of the 6, but it has a surprising amount of power. Excellent trunk space and if you do need more room there is a 60/40 fold down rear seat. Vehicle handling is decent and it is a relatively smooth ride. The new interior and exterior styling is what stands out for me. Chevy did a great job with that.","Auto headlamps, interior lighting, exterior design and body, front and rear legroom, XM, OnStar, info display on dash with oil life, outside air temperature, mpg, tire pressure and other info.

Chevy's unlimited ad budget must be working. Nothing but compliments on its looks. I had a choice for a lease car between a Pontiac G6 & the Malibu. I never have ordered a car without driving one first much less without seeing it. Boy am I glad I chose the Malibu sight unseen. Since it is a lease vehicle my company speced it out with the 3.5Lt.V6 , 4 Speed auto & hydraulic steering (can't get it this way ""retail""). It looks great, rides great & drives great.","The interior has the ""dual cockpit"" look of a late 50's early 60's Vette I really like it. It has lots of places to store stuff in the console, in the doors & even a compartment on the top center of the dash.(I travel a lot for work & this will be very convenient). It handles and stops very nice. ",Change the release lever for the tilt / telescope wheel. I like to drive with the wheel low and towards me. This makes it hard to get in & out of the car without tilting the wheel out of the way & in this car it is a hassle to push the leave down & lift up the wheel & relock the leaver.
