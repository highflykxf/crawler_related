I was just informed that there is a ""football sized hole in my floorboard"" on 9/30/16, drivers side. Passenger side was not checked. I was told this is a common issue, but thought to affect 2002-2006 models. Wrong!!!   I am shocked to hear this as I fully expected to drive this car for ten years. Remember Toyota buying back Tacoma trucks because of rust issues? This was a company protecting the reputation of it's products and serving the customers who bought them. Nisssan will not recall these affected vehicles even though the problem is acknowledged to exist. Never buying another Nissan.",,

3,Great performance but terrible comfort,Chris ,05/17/2016,4,3,2,,,4,5,5,1,,,"My 2008 Nissan Altima 2.5s has a great engine and transmission compared to the Hondas, Hyundais and even Chevrolets that I have owned.  Nissan really has it down when it comes to their drive trains but I have never had front seats on any vehicle that I have ever owned, including my 1956 Chevrolet pickup, that were as uncomfortable as my Altima seats are.  After less than one hour of driving my rear end is more sore than it would be if I was riding my mountain bike.  The seats look good but they are so stiff and lack any kind of suspension what-so-ever.  I haven't tried fixing it yet but I think that I am going to try changing the foam cushioning in the seat bottom and see how it affects my bottom.  The window controls on the driver's side are also poorly positioned.  They are so far back on the door that I can't reach them without contorting my left arm to a crazy vertical position.  I've found it easier to reach across my body with my right arm to hit the switches.  The controls were ergonomically positioned for someone with very short arms.  Besides the uncomfortable front seats and the placement of the window controls I really like the car.  I get about 28 mpg around town and 37 mpg on the highway, it has great brakes and handles good for a midsize sedan.  I would recommend the purchase of an Altima except for the granite front seats and the position of the window controls.",,

I sold it with 103,000 miles on it to get a lower mileage car. The car turned out to be a reliable car that can be driven for many more miles. It has an attractive, sporty look. It provided a smooth ride, quality audio, frosty air conditioning, and good brakes. The controls are easy to read and to figure out. I had no problems driving in snow or rain.

4,Honest 2008 Altima coupe 2.5 automatic review.,Kyle Garrison ,12/19/2015,4,3,5,,,5,3,3,4,,,"This is the first car I bought. I'm not gonna talk much about my story, just stick to what you wanna hear. The pros and the cons. I'm going to start out with saying I'm very happy with this car and I'm happy I bought it. I first bought it fully stock except with a nice spoiler on it which is a great touch to the already nice look the car has. It's a nice quiet car but not anything worth racing with. The interior is very nice looking and I have 0 complaints about it. There isn't any cool tech but that's okay to me. The exterior is very nice and slick. What I like about it the most is I find it unique looking, something not everyone has. It tops out at 111mph won't go any fastester. Here are the cons i have with the car. It tends to over heat easily which had me worried. Also the stock tires are awful. And It does not handle turns well. Those are my only complaints. Besides that it's a smooth riding car with a nice exterior/interior and a very smooth shifting transmission. If you want to make the car extra nice, loud, and worth racing with, put a stillen air intake, header, and exhaust system on. Runs great, sounds great, and doesn't over heat anymore. Definitely will be turning heads when you drive by!",,
5,sporty little economy car,Chris ,12/11/2015,5,3,4,,,5,4,4,3,,,"I bought this car over 7 years ago, and it has taken us on several trips without any issues. Other than a new battery from time to time and oil changes often, this car has been great to us. Just recently, on a trip to Florida, I noticed the transmission was slipping a bit and the cruise control would not work because the sensor de-activated it, and the engine light came on. I pulled into a autozone store and they checked it quickly and advised that the transmission needed to be repaired or replaced. I drove the car a little slower on the last leg of the trip home without any problems. When I got home, I researched the site about complaints on certain cars, and discovered that the Altima had some issues. To my surprise the transmission had a 120Kmile warranty and my car had a little over 105K miles on it. I took it to Carriage Nissan in Gainesville Ga. and Alex, the service person gave me Great news. The transmission needed to be replaced and it was covered, 100%. He ordered a new transmission and the following day it arrived and I dropped my car off and was given a brand new Altima while mine was being fixed. two days later , my car was ready and just like they said, no charge and the loaner car was free. I cannot say enough of how well they treated me and Nissan's warranties are legit. I'm looking forward to a couple more years out of the car, and they definitely made that possible. This is the best 17 thousand dollars I ever spent.",,

In 2011 we replaced wheel bearings, exhaust shield came loose, and radio would become unresponsive on random occasions - light would dim and volume controls would only cycle 6 and 7.Then in 2012 at 51k, the tranny goes. Yes, Nissan came through and forked over $5k towards replacing it as well as some other outstanding recall and emmision problems. Thanks for that. From a simple, cheap car all she wanted was decent reliability, at least up to a respectable 80k. But tranny at 51k. No",It fits my son's car seat much better than our BMW 335.

Lived up to exactly what it's built to be, a front wheel drive sporty car! First trip was to North Carolina in the first week of owning the car, averaged between 70-75mph on the eight hour trip from Florida (may have given it the beans a few times on the hwy as well) and had a 31mpg rating both ways to and from NC. Decided to give the suspension a work out on the mountain roads of Pisgah national forest. The car handled beautifully! The ride is TIGHT though, don't expect a soft ride in the SE package. It is made to be sporty! Loved the car and would only change the turning radius. ","Great engine, wonderful transmission (don't forget to get it serviced at 50k!!) spectacular sound system for a factory stock sound. For a small coupe it fit my 6'3"" frame quite easily as well as room for two of my friends. The fold down rear seats SAVED me many times as I am a active musician and had to cram 3 guitars, amplifier, speaker cabinet, pedal board, and backpack filled with accessories in the car on a regular basis. It did take some ""tetrising"" but it can be done! Also will fit 7'10"" fishing rods with the seats down, this was my SUV hah! Averaged about 26mpg on a daily basis, for a 270hp car if found that pretty impressive. ","Biggest improvement needed was the turning radius at slow speeds. To put it in perspective it almost equates to the turning radius of the moon. At faster speeds it handles as fine as any FWD car will, wish it was a RWD vehicle, but then they'd be shooting themselves in the foot wouldn't they?

Just bought new tires which is the first money into the car other than normal maintenance. The things I would like to change are the touchy brakes that can catch quicker than expected in comparison to other vehicles I've driven and result in some jerky stopping once in a while.

I have around 45,000 miles on it and 2 days ago, it started getting really loud, almost like an ATV. When I let off the gas, it still roars loudly. The engine has always been very loud and it has gotten worse with time. It has always jerked when taking off and it smells flooded when you start it.

It is smooth but not reliable or durable. After just 55,000 miles the transmission began to act up on warmer days especially in stop and go traffic. The dealer just said, ""oh that can't happen. They reset the check engine light and charged me to replace the fluid (60K service) and the very next week it got worse, check engine light on all the time. They spent 5 hours telling me a new transmission would be covered under the extended warranty. I am trading this troubled CVT Altima in on a HONDA Accord!

I downsized from a 2007 Infiniti M35 those seats were OK. Before I bought the Altima I had read several posts in Edmunds about uncomfortable seats on long drives and I should have listened better. It only takes 5 minutes and my back starts hurting. I do have back problems but this pain is different. It feels like there is no support in some areas especially left side. I have bought padded lumbar cushions but it did not help much. I would invest in custom seats if it would help but if not I am going take loss and get another car but what car in this class has superior comfort?,V6 CVT Handling Styling far better than Honda Accord or Camry. Keyless entry and proximity sensor. Leg room and passenger space. Large trunk,These seats are beyond bad I might qualify for disability as these seats are killing my back.

5,Still Very Happy,Becca ,03/06/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I wanted a 6-speed 2.5 with Premium, and I special ordered it before they even arrived at the dealership.  I was hesitant about Intelligent Key and the push-button start, but I really like both of them - especially the iKey for the safety factor.  When gas was over $4.00 a gallon, I loved the 35 MPG I was getting on the highway!  This is the nicest car I've ever owned, so I have very little criticism.  I *did* have the whistling mirror issue, which the dealership quickly resolved.  Also, my passenger seat shakes at high speed if nobody is sitting in it, and that can be somewhat distracting.  No fix for that, I'm told.

Windows roll down by themselves, once overnight during freezing rain.  Nissan mechanics could not fix that problem. The other issue was the CVT. On wet pavement with a fast takeoff the transmission would stay at around 4000 RPM unless you backed off completely from the gas and waited a few seconds.  Really liked the looks, couldn't live with the two problems.  Traded Altima in on a VW.  ",Base stereo was excellent.

The new Altimas are really sporty, fun to drive and reliable.  I have black leather seats and they weren't the most comfortable when I first purchased the car but after a year they are great.  The four cylinder has plenty of power and this is coming from a person who drove a 4 Runner with a V8 engine for 3 years.

The Spec V was a wonderful bang for the buck, and I have graduated to the next level of bang for the buck with my new Altima Coupe SE with Premium Package.  Hands down, this is the best daily driver sport coupe on the market.  Plenty of performance without sacrificing comfort.  The Bose stereo is fantastic.  Homelink and Bluetooth systems are absolutely wonderful.  Plenty of punch with the VQ35DE motor paired with the Xtronic CVT.  Takes a bit of getting used to coming from a 6 speed manual.  The speed can sneak up on you very easily as the car accelerates effortlessly at any RPM.",Intellikey setup is INCREDIBLY convenient.  Leave keys in the pocket and operate everything in the car.  Bluetooth system has had the kinks worked out from earlier variations in the 06 Infiniti G models.  Push button start is just sexy.  So are the leather seats.,"I actually lost trunk space coming from my B15 Sentra.  This is an Altima, so I found this astonishing.  The Accord coupe has a massive trunk (although it has a massive rear to go with it). Not as much clearance into the back seats as I would like, but I did buy a 2 door, so I can't much complain."
4,Manual transmission issue,richard keyser ,02/10/2009,,,3,5,4,4,,4,4,4,4,I find the interior to be rather cheap for a car of that price range.

The best mpg I have achieved is 30 mpg when I first bought the car, but this has decreased to around 25 mpg, even on highway driving.  The most disturbing aspect of driving my Altima though is the jerky performance of the engine/variable speed transmission.  In suburban driving the engine stumbles along until the speed of 40 mph is reached.  I can only describe its performance as rough, depending on the rpm modulated by the transmission.  When descending hills the transmissions gears down, rather than coast for increased fuel efficiency.  My last purchase of a cvt.","Body and interior quality.

Most importantly, the exterior of the car crinkles very easily (per auto body mechanic). I had a plastic empty shopping car 3 inches away from the car. It rolled into my car and made a ding. I hope I never get into an accident!  I also had a problem with my TPMS light malfunctioning. Also, there is a terrible blind spot when you back up from parking spaces. My sister-in-law has the same problem with her Altima. It's either the back of the car is too high or it's the fact there isn't a good visual field from inside the car. not enough window. Very dangerous.","6-speed transmission, quiet ride, handling is awesome, great acceleration.",Improve rear view visual field/blind spot. The keyless entry remote runs on special batteries.

I had the car in at the dealership several times to fix squeaking sound caused by moonroof.

I'm in search of a really good gripping tires for the front.  I fell in love with the car style (love the rear), the leather, the moon roof, etc.  The keyless thing was supposed to be a selling point, but I wouldn't buy another one, I've walked away forgetting to shut the car off!

It fixed 75% of the noises, but in 2 weeks, they had all returned. The next few times, the technician couldn't reproduce the problem therefore couldn't fix the problem.

It was fun to drive until I had to take it in for driver side seat movement.  The driver seat moves left to right when you do any type of turns.  It even moves when you move it by hand. Dealers last note on their service paper ""Fixed the broken bushing, seat still moves.""  I have called their customer support number.  They keep telling me that they are working on this problem.

Test drove Accord and Camry. Finally chose Altima as I liked the design and CVT. I am proud I made good choice and I love to drive this car. Especially you don't feel any speed impacts though the vehicle runs at 80 - 90 MPH. I'm sure Nissan engines are pretty famous for reliability. It's overall a good reliable car for a reasonable price.","CVT, speed, indicators for everything, Bose audio system, push button start.",a) An MP3 playback should have been added in base model as MP3 is quite common now. b) Engine noise is more when static though I don't observe much while driving.

There is no doubt in my mind Nissan makes the best performing engines.  For the amount of money you spend, I would put the Altima against anything in its price range.  You can tell that Nissan spends more money on research and development than any other car manufacturer.     I put twenty thousand miles in the first year and my Altima still looks and performs as good as the first day I had it.  I've had no rattles, no nickel and dime problems like Ive seen in other cars and at sixty five miles an hour with nitrogen filled tires I feel like Im flying in air.","Push button ignition, intelligent key, and curtain airbags as standard equipment is great.",Lets make a 300hp Altima!

I'm averaging 31MPG, mostly HWY but some city.  I LOVE the CVT.  Nissan did an incredible job with it.  It's smooth and the manual option is a fun bonus when I feel like it.

This car is so fun to drive. The 6 spd manual is quick and sharp, and the power is endless. Mash the gas at 60 mph and watch the world turn blurry. Interior is spacious and comfortable, and the exterior styling turns heads, especially mine.

He just bought the new Lexus sports car and he says that if he could do it all over again he would have gotten the 08 Altima Coupe because it drives almost as well and looks sharper on the outside, is more comfortable, and when you factor in that it is half the price it's a no brainer.

I tested the Camry SE and the Accord EX and this car blew both away.   It's wonderfully powerful and quiet, gives a comfortable, tuned and composed ride for a sport trim vehicle.  Handling is fantastic, very well balanced and easy to control.   Mileage with a Yakima rack is OK at 23 mpg in mixed driving.  Definitely recommend the use of at least mid grade gas, as regular sucks about 3-4mpg from the mileage.  Legroom for a 6'3"" guy like me is good, much better than Camry and Accord.

I dislike the way Nissan lumps their options but the S model has everything I wanted without going overboard.  I'm sure I will get a speeding ticket and this car has some power to only have 4cly.  I have to keep the cruise set otherwise I find myself going 80 and don't even realize it.  I researched the new Camry, Accord, and Malibu and this won hands down in my book.

4,You may want to look elsewhere,MCITV08 ,09/02/2008,,,4,5,4,2,,4,5,4,4,"Overall, the new 2008 Altima is much larger, more stylish and much ""different"" car. The Altima's CVT is something to get very used to; not hearing the shifts or feeling when the car is shifting makes the car feel like it's constantly whining. However having that constant thrust of flowing power is also a positive. Personally, Nissan never lived up to the expectation of Toyota or Honda, but this Nissan (especially the coupe) may have Honda buyers look at Nissan. However, take one ride in a new 2008 Honda Accord, and you won't ever look back at Nissan. ","CVT, hate it and love it. Great stereo system. Very comfortable seating positions.",Performance is very plain. Steering is too light to the point where you don't know what the car is doing.

Originally looked at the manual, but read up on the CVT, tested it, and I love it: the powerful and smooth acceleration is hard to describe. Manual-mode is great fun too.  A real head-turner.  You don't see many coupes on the road, and I've had LOTS of compliments on it (mine's black).  For the money, I don't know how you can beat the power, handling, and styling. For me this car is a good mix: a sporty ""driver's car"", but still comfortable and practical for the daily commute (especially the front-wheel drive for winter).",1) Overall power/performance. 2) Exterior styling. 3) Driver's seating comfort - the seat and steering wheel tilt/telescope give you unlimited options. 4) BlueTooth. 5) Keyless/pushbutton system. 6) Bose system/XM.,The suspension is a little more harsh than it needs to be for the everyday driver. Could use more trunk space.

We have not had any major problems yet, but the trunk hinge spring now rattles and we can see that some of the paint job is not as good as we might have hoped.

Bluetooth works fantastic and sounds excellent. Moonroof is nice too. Great gas mileage and plenty of power with the CVT. Fun to drive. Great car for the money. Premium package worth every penny.  I've owned over 30 cars and this is one of the nicest.  I compare it to my 2003 BMW 330 convertible with sport package and I feel the Altima coupe is just as nice.

I ran the numbers, test drove all three and made it a point to get opinions from owners of each of them. From all of my research, I finally purchased the Altima the other day and can say that I have made the right choice!

Biggest trunk for my work stuff, most comfortable driving position (armrests, steering wheel position awesome). Driver's legroom amazing. SL/Connection package great! CVT very odd but it works well. Pushbutton start is really cool. Only things need to be addressed are better rim/tire sizes. ""T"" rated 60 series tire gives great ride but mushy handling. Should come with ""H"" rating.

The mileage is very good as long as you do not use the engine.  Disciplined cruising at 65 with no silly sprints, this car delivers 30 mph (if you believe the on board computer), but at 75 it is closer to 26.  On a recent trip from NJ to MA, we did 515 miles on 20 gallons.  The trip computer said we got 27.1mpg, but a calculator says 25.75.  The premium package offers bluetooth which we like a lot.

The transmission is excellent though it takes a bit getting used to.  The seats are comfortable and I can fit my 3 kids in the back (3 car seats).

Look at it from the rear and a little to the side and its a joy to behold. The 4 cylinders get you up to speed without even trying. Back seat has more headroom (slightly) than the Scion tC and Civic coupe -- but a 6-footer's head might touch the rear window. Not sure about mileage. I'm still on the first tank, but it seems fairly decent. Front seats are very comfortable, with good driver's lumbar support. Driver's leg compartment is more comfortable than Civic coupe, where the parking hand brake bothered my knee, and more spacious than the Mazda 3 sedan that crowded my lower leg. A lot of quality for the money. ","The beautifully tapered trunk and overall exterior styling, driver's seat, powerful smooth 4-cylinder Nissan engine. Fit and finish is superb. ","I don't quite understand the allure of the push button starter as opposed to a key, but it works fine. Wish the front end had a more attractive design.

I got it loaded - 3.5 SE V6 + Prem package and nav/XM. IS 250 had too small of a backseat, the 328i was out of my price range and I'm just not a Mercedes girl. I love to drive around with the windows down, the sunroof open and the Bose speakers blaring. Perfect for those sunny San Diego days. The CVT engine is great but takes a little time to get used to if you are a manual transmission girl at heart like me. Overall a great ride! Previously owned a Ford and 2 Mitsus. What a difference!

It is a truly amazing car with outstanding gas mileage and fun to drive. I got 31 mpg on mixed city/hwy driving.  It is fun to drive with plenty of ponies to spare on  the hwy.  The CVT is very smooth and the rev rarely over 2000 rpm even at 70 mph.  Five-star crash test rating gives me a peace of mind.

My wife preferred a Camry but she doesn't appreciate the better handling of the Altima like I do.  It has a slight vibration at low speeds but the dealership assures me it is the tires having flat spots from sitting in the lot so long.  It did seem to get better today as I drove 85 miles. I simply LOVE the car. I am 60 and it is the best all around car I have ever owned - quiet at all speeds, comfortable, very economical (if I can believe the instantaneous mileage readout) and gorgeous. Nissan hit a home run with this one. I got the Jade Green color with Blond interior and love it.  The AC is superb and I absolutely LOVE the handling and CVT.","CVT, powerful and quiet AC, handling. The way the car all seems just right and natural. The incredible mileage. If you drive it conservatively you'll be amazed.

The 4cyl blew the doors off my friend 4cyl accord, and picks up and hauls! The tires are GREAT in the rain, but the large sidewall makes the performance during turns and quick maneuvers quite sloppy.  The spoiler definitely makes it look classy. I had to have my door repainted fresh off the lot due to poor clearcoat application and discoloration of paint. I was quite upset. Now my window doesnt have auto up. Just down. I have had 2 Nissan prior to this and one Infiniti. I am disappointed that this car has had this many ""issues"" in less than 2500 miles.","Push button start, quiet ride, fun to drive, great looking, dual exhausts, decent radio.","Convenience package should have the spoiler like the 3.5SE. doors sound cheap when they close.  but the back deck needs to be anchored more, it rattles like crazy.

No hesitation when you hit the gas to pass another car. Should have XM radio standard. Much more fun to drive than my Camry, tires are MUCH cheaper to replace.

5,Early Impressions,LPL ,07/08/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just purchased my Altima 2 weeks ago, but, so far, Im thrilled.  Nissan wasnt on my radar initially, but after a good bit of research (mostly on Edmunds), I decided to give it a look.  I was really impressed by the overall package, the styling, the ride, the performance are all great considering the overall price.  And the gas mileage ratings were as good or better than anything else I was considering, while the 2.5L engine has sufficient pep.  It had the most bang for the buck of the vehicles I test drove, by a comfortable margin.  Two weeks in, I have no complaints, still quite pleased with the purchase.  Im getting right about 29 mpg, with a mix of commuting and in- town driving.  ","The SL package  Im quickly getting used to niceties such as leather seats, moonroof, and the keyless start.  And the dual climate control is my wifes favorite feature. With the gas mileage and an 18-gallon tank, the range is approaching 500 miles. ",Some of the interior trim isnt quite as upscale as the overall feel.  Items like the door panels and the trim around the shifter just look cheap.  But thats really quite minor. I wish the Altima had daytime running lights

I just didn't fit without my head bumping the roof in the new Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and Hyundai Sonata. But, much to my surprise, the Nissan Altima was a winner in terms of ""fit."" I'm very impressed with the power of the 4- cylinder, which felt much like what I had in my old V6 Accord. It rides very smooth, quiet and is refined. I'm very glad I bought this vehicle and have absolutely no buyer's remorse. It has a great aggressive style to it and wonderful for touring.",Keyless functions. Quiet and smooth ride. Feels solid. Excellent A/C. Excellent controls. Great room (front seats). Superb styling. Safety features are top-notch. Tires are exceptional. Live MPG display encourages better driving habits as it's almost a game with me to see how I can max the mileage!,"Offer extras without packages such as alloy wheels, fog lights, radio, etc. I went with base model because I didn't want to buy full packages and would rather cherry pick which I want to add.

It handles extremely well in rain storms and any inclement weather. Heavy water on the roadway does not affect its traction nor does it pull on the steering wheel, as it did on my 2005 Altima.

Don't buy this car if you are not interested in a sport car but just like the looks.  It has a very sporty ride (sport tuned suspension) and rides like it's on rails, superb handling.  Acceleration is excellent and the CVT (continuously variable transmission) shifts seamlessly when in drive mode.  You can manually shift it as well.  My wife and I call it a baby Z.

I love my 2.5S coupe, and it fits me like a glove.  When I first bought the car, the tires really needed breaking in.  Once they had a few miles on them, the car became a lot more steady at high speeds (70-80 mph).  My gas mileage continues to improve too!  At first, I was only getting 22 mpg city.  Now, even with the air conditioning, I'm getting 30 mpg in the city!!  The longer I have it, the more it's breaking in.

I felt like it was going to be a shock moving down to a  small car but it really hasn't been that bad. Has a great solid ride and I love the CVT. One thing I've noticed is the performance when you have it on cruise control. Every vehicle I've had before you would have a lag and then rapid acceleration when you went up a hill. Not with this car. It just plugs on along no matter the terrain and this has to be because of the transmission.

I've gone on several trips of over 2 hours and find the seats to be perfectly comfortable - for two people. Also, the gas tank holds about 18 gallons so there are fewer refueling stops than you'd expect. Especially considering it has power to take off and still has less fuel consumption than any V6.

The fuel economy is exceptional for a mid-size sedan. The 4 cyl behaves like a 6 cyl. I do wish we had the option of getting leather seats without the need to buy the SL package, but I'll just bring the car to a good interior shop to change the seats to a custom leather interior. This vehicle should be on anyones list for a mid-sized sedans.","Exterior body style, intelligent key, fuel economy.","Nissan's requirement to purchase the SL package to get leather seats.

My family needed another vehicle because we have a child and needed better gas milage than my 06 Dodge Ram. This car is great!!!

After having it for 5 days, the car would only start after pushing the start button 15+ times (which the service technician claims it's a defective battery - we'll see)  and the a/c compressor has to be replaced (was making a rattling noise).  I've had an altima since it debuted in '92 and had no problems with its previous versions.  I'm hoping that the new coupe doesn't prove me that Nissan is now marketing more on design and failing on overall reliablility.","The coupe design is a plus.  CVT, responsive brakes, stiff suspension, relatively low blindspots for a coupe, and room rear seats for a coupe.  The keyless entry and start up are quite a novelty item.

My only complaint is the limited choice of interior colors to match up with the available exterior colors.

During normal driving mid 30s fuel economy. If I baby it, I've gotton close to 40 mpg. Gauges are easy to read day or night. Standard halogen lamps, push start, all standard. I love the fact that I never have to pull the keys out of my pocket. The 4cyl Altima easily beats 4 cyl Accord and Camry of the line and passes better as well. All for a car that is in the low 20s.","Push start, very bright dash and guages, really awesome looks, fantastic fuel economy, lots of power for a 4 cyl.",Car is a little light at high speed and a windy day.

I live in the country where the roads are hilly and expect the mpg to be down a bit but can't see how I would ever get 25-27. The CVT is so intrusive at times, everytime the car goes downhill or around a corner with a downgrade it downshifts. At times this seems great but not all the time. Leaves you wondering. However I think if you live in less hilly areas performance would be better.",No keys.,Get rid of CVT!

The engine is very strong at all speeds, exhaust has a muted but otherwise nice growl.  Does not handle like a BMW or Saab Aero, but will walk away from most with its 270 hp.  Car has a solid feel and fresh design.  Big enough to actually carry normal sized people!

4.5,Great car but ,Rich ,04/07/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,4,4,4,"Everything is great but I am disappointed with MPG. I average 26 and do mostly highway driving. Thought I would get 30 mpg. Also, the nav system is bad compared to garmin or others.  It is stupid how to save a point, forcing you to go out and around and back it to name it. Also can not access your saved points while the car is moving.  I feel stopping on a highway is FAR more dangerous than accessing your saved points as you get near your destination. Stay away from remote start, 3 tries and they still can not get it right with the push button start. My suggestion is NOT to go for the technology package. Voice command does not work either. Other than that I recommend the car.","Keyless system. Push button start. Outside style Interior design Power and acceleration for a 4 cyl.

I had planned to get the Accord after trading in my Toyota Corolla since cutting my commuting distance.  After researching and driving many different cars, I went for the base 3.5 SE for looks, features and I was impressed with the engine and CVT.  After about 1000 miles, I can say the car is great, and I have no regrets.  I would buy the same car again.","The look is distinctive and the car is fast, smooth and handles very well.  Good MPG for this performance and V6, I am getting 23-24 with city-highway mix.",Seats are too firm!  I think the wheels don't live up to the car's styling.

The look of the car and its uniqueness on the road alone sold me. It is very fun to drive and responsive for me. The seats are perfect and the basic package brought what I needed and not the extras I honestly see as unnecessary. The 4 liters saves gas and since I am a penny pincher with little money, this helps a lot and trust me, it can keep up on the highway. While you may find some gripe with the car, such as small trunk space and no existent back seat, honestly, this car is perfect for me as a teenage driver. Honestly, with 4 liters, I get the power I need and my parents do not have to worry like a V6.",The size of the car on the exterior is perfect for safety. Mileage is awesome compared to my mom! The sportiness is perfect and the car is powerful for a 4 liter. The look of the car is what truly draws in the crowd. Also the uniqueness on the road helps a lot too.,"A larger back seat and trunk space would be nice. The grille of the car does look a little ugly compared to its sister, the 4dr Altima.

Really appreciate the standard iPod jack (some other manufacturers charge extra) though I hate its location - the cable runs down the console to the IiPod. The 2.5 S base model is a bargain for the money when bought right. The CVT is far superior to conventional automatic transmission. Keyless entry is great!

I love the CVT except when going down hills.  The transmission makes a humming noise.  The dealer said this was normal and there was nothing to worry about.  I like the keyless remote except I have to keep my windows and trunk locked, because they were opening.  The dealer said that if the button hit something, that they could open your window and trunk.

The 3.5 engine is so powerful, and the CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) is very smart and seems to read your mind.  If you just cruise around town, the CVT keeps the engine revs low to save gas, but if you give it more throttle, it quickly lets the engine spin up (no shift lag) and it MOVES.  When shifted ""manually"" the CVT shifts very quickly through the preset 6 speeds.  Can feel bumps with the SE vs SL (luxury) version, but it's a reasonable trade-off for larger wheels, better shocks and stiffer anti-roll (sway) bars.  Steering a bit numb, but sticks well in curves.  I love it!","Sporty handling. Engine torque.  Well programmed CVT. Bose radio is strong, bluetooth is nice. Large interior and trunk space. Contrary to many other reviews, you can fold the rear seats into the trunk from the inside.  There's a hidden button above the right rear seat for fold-down.","Very pricey option packages, I think Technology Package is not worth the money.  Nissan needs to un-bundle options.

4.625,I love the car; however...,katydid ,02/16/2008,,,5,5,3,5,,5,5,4,5,"The car drives wonderfully with great pickup. Around town driving got 20 mpg on the first two tanks and 21.8 on the third. Lots of well-designed storage space. The basic radio/cd player sounds great and picks up far-away stations.  I love the fold-down back seats. Here's the however: My car's taillights leaked when I got the car.  The sensor on the passenger side airbag turns the bag off sporadically when a 160-190 lb adult sits on that side. The dealer can't find the problem.  There is no manual override to force the airbag to function, so my passengers are sometimes in danger. The ""you've left your key in the car"" alarm sounds when my key is in my pocket outside the car.","Lots of storage space! Fold-down back seats. Great pickup. Comfortable quiet ride. Good basic sound system with an mp3 plug-in. Beautiful exterior styling, and the Metallic Jade color is lovely.  Airbags on all sides.","Collapsible side mirrors. A manual override to the passenger airbag controller. I'd rather have a regular key with a chip than the fragile intelligent key which can't be dropped, gotten wet, or be near a cell phone.

Just tapping the accelerator makes the car want to dash right off the starting line. CVT is wonderful as well. Had an old automatic Mazda Protege and I could feel each and every gear change. Now, I just drive, smoothly too.  Interior is roomy. I can fill each seat and all the passengers are comfy with enough leg room. A lot of compartments to store stuff. Glove box is cavernous. Doors give a nice solid thunk when closing.",Intellikey system is great. Not having to fumble for keys is the best thing since sliced bread. Gas mileage is better than expected. Takes me about 2 1/2 weeks for the fuel to run to empty (about 125mi per week). The Alty's (2.5S) fuel tank takes about 510mi to go from F to E.,Seats (fabric) are a bit stiff. Interior ceiling is quite lower than I expected and it seems to be made of very hard cardboard (my best guess). I can only assume its for safety and the ease of deployment for the side airbags. The 4 banger is a bit noisy too. Cargo net is the smallest ever seen.

I noticed a vibration in the front end, on the drive home, between 63 and 70 mph (approx 20 miles). Took it to a tire shop to check the balancing, that helped, but didn't solve it. I'm on my third trip to the Nissan shop. If this doesn't fix the problem, I will have to consider another vehicle.  The vibration and what I would consider a hard ride, has soured me.

So in December 2007 I decided to try the Nissan Altima (2008).  I was very surprised at the pickup that this car had for a 4 cyl. (the Honda had a 4 cyl. too but was not as peppy).  So after spending a couple hours at the dealership working out the details, I drove out being the proud owner of a 2008 Nissan Altima 2.5 S.  Right off the bat my mileage around town is 25 mpg.  There aren't any sedans in this class that really come close to 25 mpg.  I really love this car.  It handles like a dream and is very sporty.

The car has excellent handling capabilities despite the front drive setup and the 3.5 V6 is as sweet as they come!

I previously owned a 2004 Camry and it also was solid but it lacked style and power.You won't be disappointed. I bought mine in Georgia while on vacation and drove it back to Chicago.

Much quieter, sportier, better features.  Drives like a dream around corners and on fwy. Got MSRP out the door inc. Phantom recovery system.  Added 6-yr. full extended warranty for $850.

Voice recognition system is TERRIBLE for both navigating and trying to phone someone. Went to the dealer twice now with no help. It is about 40-50 % accurate, which is not acceptable to me.

I always wanted an Infiniti but couldn't justify the price, mpg, and rwd. The 2.5 is fine performance wise, the SL, connection, and nav packages give you everything you could need. Things I miss are memory seats, power pass seat, and folding mirrors. The 3.5 folding mirrors with turn signals will swap out for less than $300.

I'm usually interested in the next class up in cars - saab, volvo, audi, infiniti, but for affordability and performance I had to have the new Altima.  Its features beat out many of the Infiniti G35, which I was seriously looking at buying.  With a family on the way, we needed something with a big backseat this has it.  Its sporty styling is a great match for the sporty and responsive drive experience.  I can't wait to get past the recommended 1200 mile break in period so I can drive this car like it want to be driven - FAST.  I'm proud to say I'm a Nissan owner and love driving my Altima any chance I get. I also like there aren't many of these on the road yet.","CVT is an awesome ride experience with a ""gearless"" feel.

4.625,What a car!,Neil ,11/15/2007,,,5,5,4,4,,5,5,4,5,"I traded my '99 A6 for this Altima and have ZERO regrets.  Handling is similar.  The Altima with the 2.5 4-banger eats the Audi for lunch. Amazing power for a 4 cyl. The suspension is just stiff enough to feel sporty, yet does not sacrifice comfort.  I've been actively trying to find something to find fault with, but have no complaints.  Excellent value for the price.  The fit and finish are top notch.  Even the stock sound system was good enough that I didn't go for the Bose.","Handling, ride quality, CVT, power, fuel economy, styling both inside and out.",I'll let you know when I think of something :)

I was looking at the Camry as well as the Accord, but the Altima stood up ahead of the other two. The CVT is awesome. For a 4 cylinder, it drives like a 6 cylinder. My only problem is that there is a rattling noise when I turn up the Bose speakers to volume 15 of 32. It sounds like something is loose in either the dash or the passenger door.

It needs a smoother ride and the driver's side blind spot to be fixed, in addition at 5'10"" I feel as though I am too short for the car and as if I am below the sweet spot looking out. All told it's a great car and with a few minor adjustments it would be great, I'm very satisfied with it.","I didn't think it was a big deal until I went to test drive the car on a cold November night - get the premium package which includes the heated seats, you'll love them. I also like the CVT engine and Bose radio system.","The car rides very ""hard"", you're going to feel every little bump in the road. This car is great but it needs to absorb more of the billion little pot-holes and bumps out there more smoothly.

I test drove a Lexus IS 250 the same day and there was no comparison.

I haven't even let my wife drive it yet and I've had it a week!","Bose sound system is awesome, the exterior styling is very sporty and clearly draws from the Z and G35/37 Coupes.

I've been driving a Toyota Solara for 5 years and was looking for something sporter.  I purchased a ""Code Red"" coupe and I love it.  Heads turn as I whiz by.

I also considered a Mazda3, the new Honda CRV and the Camry and Accord.  The Altima was the perfect combination for me.  It is a roomy car with great amenities, but also has styling that I like. It looks a little sportier than some of the competitors.","Heated seats, Bluetooth phone feature, keyless ignition.",Side view mirrors seem small to me.  I would prefer if they were a bit bigger.

I recommend this vehicle to everyone who wants great value for the money.,"Vehicle style and handling, engine performance, interior convenience package and comfort are excellent.

I've been carefully breaking it in over the past few weeks and I like it more each time I drive it. My dogs can get in the back seat easy and seem to enjoy the view when they go for a cruise. All instruments are laid out to use easily. I'm going easy the 1st few thousand miles so I'm doing things in stages. I like the keyless starting and all the displays. The a/c works fine and the std radio is good. I didn't get the 3 high $$ options but I did get the cheap 3 and the new homelink/compass option mirror - a great deal! Only 3 other cars in 38 years have had me so excited.,"CVT, all the displays, the cloth seats with the dark slate outside color - only one in 5 states I could find online. The rear design is 'money'. The std equip. leaves little else to want for me. Could have opted for more expensive car but I doubt it would be any more fun to own and drive.","Add option for rear deck spoiler. Come on - who designed the cargo net, an elf? Get a bigger one! It needs a chunk of rubber to protect the doors from others in the parking lots. But these are all minor suggestions."
5,Awesome Car!,solace ,10/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Nissan cars have always been very reliable and good cars. The new Altimas are also one of the coolest looking cars on the road.

I purchased my 08 Altima on 10/19 and it has been a thrill! I love to CVT.  I was going to going to get the 3.5 but my pockets wouldn't allow me. I happened to approach a 2.5 S that had leather seats put in along with the woodgrain kit so i went with it. I love the overall design and feel of the car. Great gas mileage.

My last car was a 2004 Camry and when it came time to trade I headed back thinking I was going to like the new Camry's & was very disappointed. My husband & I decided to try Nissan again and fell in love with a 2008 Altima. Even though it's a 4cyl. with the CVT it's perfect. The price, style and options were amazing for the price. It definitely beat Toyota's line up. If you want something sporty, economical and fun to drive, this is it.

The interior is very roomy with a lot of head and leg room and a great amount of places to stash your extra belongings (wallet, mp3, cell phone). Even though the power is not comparable to a 6.0L v8 GTO, it was way more then I ever expected from a 3.5L V6. My first vehicle was an old Maxima and Nissan really makes some reliable cars.

The Altima was the best ride, quite with sufficent power.  I purchased the Altima Sedan 2.5S automatic with CVT.  The exterior is sporty but not overdone.  The interior is spacious even for myself at 6ft. 3in.  The car is great on gas, city and highway, 25-34.  I did not get any extra packages, since the car is already pretty equipped.  Well worth the price.  I liked it better all around than the other vehicles I mentioned previously.","The AC worked great, even at lowest setting it cooled the car a great deal and quickly as well.  The stereo is loud and clear, the standard 6 speaker cd. The push button start is both good and bad, remember to shut the car off and take key with you.  Trunk area very spacious.  Nice interior - roomy.",Outside mirrors do not fold in.  The aux audio jack is near the stereo so attachment of iPod will have to be done via a wire which then shows in the car.  Should have put the jack inside center console in order to hide device and wires.  Head lights are very bright will get flashed at night sometimes.
4.625,Don't See the Issues,Dan ,10/14/2007,,,4,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"Compared to the Toyota Solara (4 cyl) I've driven for the past four years (disliking it more every day) the Altima Coupe 2.5 S is an exhilarating experience.  The Altima accelerates quickly, the Solara hesitates; the Altima gives you a feel for the road, the Solara drives like a big luxury car.  If you're looking for something that drives like a ""land yacht"", buy the Solara.  If you're looking for something that's just fun to drive, the Altima is a good choice.","Continuously variable transmission (CVT) - an innovative pleasure that delivers smooth acceleration, bluetooth w/o the navigation system I don't need, HomeLink, XM radio, keyless ignition.","More interior color options (black leather and hot weather do not mix), better interior materials, improved gas mileage (a hybrid?)."

We drove all three and the lowest model of the Nissan had a smoother ride then the Accord or Camry.  I have always loved Hondas and have owned one but the Nissan's ride and look was much nicer.  The Camry and Altima both have a great style but you get more for the money with the Nissan and the ride was better also.  If you are thinking about the Altima you cant go wrong.  One warning, if you want the 3.5, get your insurance quote first, the 2.5 was not that bad.  ",The display that tells you MPG you are getting and the gauge that tells you if you have a lead foot or not; dual climate control; the controls on the steering wheel; the keyless feature; and of course the blue tooth.,I ready dont have any.

4.875,Nissan got it right,Tobyboy ,10/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Let me start off by saying I love cars and have many, many cars.  My favorite vehicle prior to this purchase was my GS 300 Lexus.   This Altima is now is my favorite car. It has it all, interior and exterior style, comfort, technology and gas economy.  Nissan got it right! I started out wanting a 4 cylinder car that is not a crap box.  Most manufacturers will make the 4 cylinder the stripped down model, with no leather, limited options, etc.  Nissan approaches this market differently.  They take the same vehicle that is available in the more pricey 6 cylinder and simply put a 4 cylinder in its place. This car is near perfect.  Accelaration with the 4 is more than adequate.","Keyless entry, push start, bose stereo, technology, exterior styling, interior styling, CVT, MPG gauge.","I do not recommend the factory navigation. It is by far inferior to aftermarket units like the garmin. It has some quirky features, it is not intuitive to use and I believe it is more dangerous to have to stop to make entries, risking being rearended. Power passenger seat, memory driver's seat."
5,Fun to drive and looks great,Charlie Zarzour ,10/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I had been shopping for a small sports car, but when I saw the 2 door coupe my mind changed. The 3.5 270 hp engine is very fast. Price point on the car is tough to beat for the horsepower, features and looks. I would recommend the Premium package and also the 3.5 over the 2.5. The 2.5 is better on gas mileage, but the 3.5 will put a smile on your face when you push down on it. This is my third Nissan. Had a Stanza with 180,000 and Frontier with 145,000. You can not beat Nissan quality. I do a lot of interstate driving and the gas mileage is good. On 2 lane roads the car passes other cars with a lot of confidence.","3.5 270 hp engine, XM radio, smooth shifting transmission the overall look of the car. Too me it looks like a G35.

It's beyond great. But the problems are there, I can't ignore it.  After a couple days of driving it, I found the suspension noise to be very loud and found it to be annoying (sounds like it's rusted metal, a ""squeak"" sound).  Two, the build material or overall finish of the interior was made with cheap material. The 2 front side of the door also made a ""squeak"" noise when you pressed upon it or when the car turned and your leg/thigh leaned against it. ","Plenty of power! 270 hp, suspension and overall ride comfort is great. multi-function steering wheel is a plus. Smooth CVT is more than great. The rear seat space is big enough to fit 6ft tall guy. Good mpg for v-6.","Gotta fix all the squeaking parts and improve the build material/quality. All the parts that I have fussed about is the noise (sunroof, suspension, door panel). If those parts were fixed, it would be a hell of a ride! "

Camry is bland, boring, and dealers wouldnt haggle with me.  G35x was my dream car that never came true (lotta bread for that car).  My friend bought an Altima and I was taken away by the tranny.  Felt like a 6 cylinder to me and the smoothness and pickup was impressive. ","CVT, keyless feature, storage compartments are huge, dual climate controls, and the wiper blades.  Not bad on gas either.  Barely hits 2000 rpm at 65 mph.  Big gas tank.","Folding mirrors only on the 3.5 blows. I would have designed a better looking rim for the 2.5s.

After sitting in the coupe and seeing that I probably couldn't get my golf bag to fit in that trunk, I made the decision to go with the sedan instead. Best decision! The Altima 3.5 SL sedan is absolutely amazing. It's loaded with every possible option under the sun. The ride is quiet, and the transmission is an engineering marvel. Extremely powerful and fuel efficient, and best of all it has a very sporty look. I like the blonde leather, and it spells class with just enough touch of the wood trim. This car lives up to the hype, and then some.","The quiet ride, the bluetooth with touch screen nav, fuel economy and the sporty and classy look inside and out.","Offer bigger wheel package options, increase the trial subscription to XM/traffic."

Car feels as if it's floating at certain speeds, mainly under 40 mph. Brakes a bit touchy but seem powerful. Visibility is very good except for backing up. Big blind spot. Need to be very good at using mirrors. Great looking color in the Azure Blue, but very, very hard to keep clean. Curious to see how it handles the snow, I live in the northeast. MPG is OK.","Comfort, CVT, one touch up and down windows, intelligent key and push button start.","Firm up suspension. Make traction control standard. Have side mirrors retractable. Why have it on the 3.5 and not on the 2.5 really seems foolish. But many manufactures do this. Just can't understand this idea. Add some sound to the car, acceleration is boring."
4.875,Don't judge a book by its cover.,nwryuber ,09/12/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've got to say that this is an absolutely incredible car and I would definitely say it is the best in its class. I looked at all of the coupes at this price point including Tiburon, Eclipse, Solara, etc., and this by far is the nicest.  The only thing that would be nice, would be a nicer interior. The interior isn't that bad as compared to the sedan in my opinion, but could definitely use work. But other than that, I've had no problems and absolutely love this car!",,
5,Great little car.,jim ,09/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Recently bought the car for my wife.  Have taken it on a few short road trips.  Car is fun to drive, fuel economy was out of this world, powerful beyond belief.",,
5,The Best car ever!,I love my altima ,09/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I absolutely love my Nissan Altima sedan. It is absolutely the most fun thing I have ever driven. It is also very spacious,and very quiet! The Interior is absolutely beautiful as well as the exterior. The keyless entry and push button start is so convenient, I never take my keys out of my purse.",Keyless entry and push button start and the meter that tells you if you have a lead foot or not.,"I wish GPS was standard in all models because i would love to have one, but other than that i would not change a thing!"
3.625,Be Careful!,Regretting Purchase ,08/31/2007,,,4,5,1,1,,4,5,4,5,"First hour off the lot, I already had problems.  I looked up at the pillar on the driver's side (the spot where the headliner meets above the window), and I see a wet spot.  Had to take it back to the dealer. Apparently there was a blockage in the drain hose from the sunroof.  Next day, I get a call. The front of the car is soaking wet.  The evaporator has also malfunctioned.  So I bought the car Wednesday, drove for a total of 40 miles (20 miles home, and then 20 miles to the dealership), and will finally be able to drive it again Friday afternoon.",I love the exterior.  The Scion tc/G35 appearance combination is excellent. ,"Should come standard with MP3 cd player. Convenience package should include power seats for both driver and passenger, not just driver.  Brakes too hard.  Factory upholstery on headliner (a beige color) does not come close to matching Charcoal interior.  And of course, the leak problem."
4.125,I like my new Altima,Guruno ,08/28/2007,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,3,5,"Have only owned a week, and came from owning a '97 Jeep Wrangler for the past 10 years, so my auto experience is rather limited. Needless to say, I love my new Altima. Very roomy - am 6' and have plenty of leg/head room. The back seats have comfortable space as well. The clutch is shorter than my old Wrangler's and the response is worlds better. The 270 HP is nice on the highway. Steering feels good at high speeds. The fuel economy is OK, but wasn't expecting much with the engine size. I like the layout of the internal controls, very intuitive. ","Keyless entry, button to start. Radio controls on steering wheel. Display readouts for MPG and outside temperature. Sunroof. Power seats, windows. Cup holders in the door and in the middle (can't have too many!).","Would like to have a hidden 1/8"" audio cable hookup in the front/bottom storage space for my iPod so I can close the door, run my IiPod, and not have any cables visible. Would like back windows to be able to go all the way down. "
4.625,Best of both worlds,mike ,08/25/2007,,,5,5,4,5,,4,4,5,5,"I had no plans to buy this car. I was looking to replace my 1996 300zx tt, which I sold a few years ago.  My wife was complaining about having 3 cars to deal with in the driveway. My daily driver is a 2003 altima. I pulled up next to one and it really caught my eye. The next day I went to the dealership and took a test drive. I knew I would be taking it home. Although, not a 300zx tt, it is sporty quick, fits the 5y/o in the back seat and is only one car in the driveway. Drive it and you'll buy it! ","Hard to pick, but i would say overall styling and engine performance! Push button start is very nice!","Upgraded interior materials, especially center console cup holders. More horsepower would never hurt. Offer factory remote start"
5,You won't be disappointed!,username ,08/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Red, premium package, technology package, just fully loaded. I had saved up and was ready to get a new 2008 Infiniti G37. I wanted to drive this car before purchasing it however. Wow great choice! Great Bose system, amazing comfort, awesome power, fantastic handling. This car just blew me away. 2 things differ from the G37 and this car. This car is front wheel drive which in the winter is going to be a big plus. However off the blocks the G does a bit better (glad I am not racing anyone). This car however has much more room inside, and the comfort is what sold me. Every feature you could want is offered on this car. For 28k out the door it's a no brainer between this and the G37. ","Bose sound system, CVT, engine, push button start and the way it drives. I mostly do city driving and I always average 24 MPG (much better then expected). Oh yeah having my dad (who just bought an 07 BMW 550 with 360 HP) going on and on about how great my car drives and handles!","Trunk is a bit small. Find a way to give it more horsepower, better gas mileage and drop the price by 5k. Yeah it's just wishful thinking :)"
4.875,This car rocks!,KurtinPA ,08/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"The engine is powerful and the CVT is smooth. I can pass cars with incredible swiftness, and the handling is tight and responsive. Mine is dark slate with black leather interior. Many people have approached me to ask about the car, especially after tinting the windows. Not that I look around too often, but this car is a head-turner! The Bose stereo is great, and I love the XM satellite radio package. It is also nice to have the bluetooth hands-free phone system. I researched a lot of new cars, and for the price, this one is the best!",Most everything about this car! Solid performance and great style. I love the driver's side one-touch window controls that work both windows up and down. ,"I also would rather have 18"" wheels as standard or as an option. Would like to have a ""seek"" button on the steering wheel for the stereo as opposed to the ""source"" button."
5,What a sweet ride!,brandir ,08/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,All I can say is wow! What a sweet ride! I just bought my coupe this week and was planning on test driving a few other vehicles in the same category.  The Altima coupe was my first test drive and I knew as soon as I took off in it there was no reason to test drive anything else.  The ride is so smooth and what a kick it has for a 4 cylinder.  I love the body style and the dual exhausts.  I don't feel like I'm sitting real low to the ground and the car feels solid.  I can't say enough great things about this car! ,"Intelligent key with push button ignition, dual exhausts, back seat is a good size for being a coupe, great gas mileage, the pick up that it has, the body style is sharp, the controls on the steering wheel, the huge glove box, I just love everything about this vehicle!!","17"" wheels, aux plug in a lower position."
5,Absolutely LOVE it!,Chardoi ,08/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My occupation requires me to drive hundreds of miles a week and I wanted a reliable and economical ""work tool.""  Stepping down from an 8-cyl BMW X5 for fuel economy, I must say that I am very pleased with the pep and gas mileage of my 2.5 S.  As an audiophile, it is very out of character for me to settle for the factory (base) stereo.  In doing so, I am pleasantly surprised at how nice is sounds.  I'm sure the Bose may be a little better, but I doubt it's worth the extra moola.  The car is quick for a 4-banger, agile, quiet at interstate speeds, and comfy.  My wife is telling her friends ""It's a miracle that he likes a 4-cyl car!""     In a nutshell, I absolutely love it!","I love that at 6'2"" and 225 pounds I fit in it comfortably.  I love the standard stereo, smooth and quiet ride, and pep of the 4-cyl engine.  The push button entry/start is fun and easy.  I even like the ""whhrrrr"" as the CVT shuts down. My absolute favorite part is the money saved at the pump!","Move the aux input down into the console so I can close the door and hide my iPod and not have the wire sticking out of the dash. A rear wiper, 17"" tires, and the upgraded side mirrors would be nice to have on my 2.5 S.  I also wish it locked automatically. But love it even without the extras. "
5,I Love My Coupe!!!!,stevesbabe ,08/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I first saw this car in a magazine and I told my husband that I had to have this car. That was at the end of May. By the 2nd week of July, I had purchased my new Altima coupe. I am so happy that I bought my coupe. It was the best decision. This is my first Nissan, and I will buy another and another. I love my car and I would not trade it for anything. People stop and ask me, ""Is that a Nissan?"" I of course say yes it is and it is mine. I have to see another coupe around here and I am glad that I was one of the first to buy it. Thanks Nissan for one awesome coupe. ","The CVT, the design of the whole car. It rocks!!","The only things that I can think of, it that the radio controls should come standard on the steering wheel and I wish that the tail light were like the ones on the 4 door. "
5,I'm in Love!,kerry ,08/02/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought my coupe a week ago, black with charcoal leather interior. I got the premium package as well. This is the first new car I have ever bought and I think it was a great decision! There is nothing about the car that I don't like. I love everything about it, inside and out. I use the bluetooth phone system a lot. The dual climate control is great. And the Bose... well its BOSE! The ride is sooo smooth! I haven't seen anyone out on the road with one yet. I would suggest this car to anyone!","Heated seats, dual climate control, bluetooth phone system, Bose sound system... ok, EVERYTHING!","I checked my gas mileage today, and it was 13! I have made many short trips showing it off, so hopefully this number will increase."
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it!!!",Vicious ,07/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had my car for about two months and it's been nothing but fun.  I've driven it around the city and taken it for a trip from Virginia Beach, VA to Pittsburgh, PA and back.  The car's got zip and is so much fun to drive.  For awhile during my trip back to VA Beach, I was getting 41 mpg, that is until I got stuck for 3.5 hours in DC for rush hour.  I still ended up with 34 mpg overall.  I'm very happy with my investment and being a Nissan, I'm sure it will last me for quite some time.","Push button start and keyless everything, my moonroof, the zip, and the exterior looks.","Gas mileage could be a little better in the city, but it's still pretty good so I can't really complain."
4.875,Awesome,Andy in Indy ,07/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,I didn't get a chance to test-drive the 3.5 until I picked it up and wow can you tell the difference.  So quick and very smooth acceleration.  Really love the car and can't beat it for the price.  Everyone who's seen it comments on how great it looks.,Outside appearance.  Power.  Handling.  Bluetooth. Steering wheel controls for stereo. Lots of cabin storage.,I can't imagine two people fitting comfortably in the back seats.  It really is a two seater unless both front seats are all the way forward. Also a small trunk but thats to be expected.
5,I LOVE my COUPE!!!,JessInFL ,07/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I bought my Azure Blue premium package coupe on Friday and I am in love with this car.  I went from a V6 down to the 4 cylinder but this car has plenty of power.  The ride is so smooth.  I haven't seen one in my area yet but I know a few have been sold.  I was actually looking at my car at the same time as 2 other people.  There are so few on the lots you can get into a war trying to get yours.  At this point I love everything about this car.  The features in the premium package are great.  The dual air conditioners work well since I am always cold when my husband is burning up.  The stereo (Bose) has great sound quality.  The seats are very comfortable.  ,"Bose stereo, dual climate control.","My hubby's only drawback is that he is 6'5"" and weighs about 280 and he would have liked a few more inches in headroom.  Not my problem, I am only 5'2"" so it is perfect for me."
5,Coupe de Grace,Coupe de Grace ,07/23/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I wanted to buy the 2007 Altima SL sedan, but the coupe caught my eye and my imagination. I test drove it and I knew I had to have this car! The leather seats are very comfortable and the sound system is excellent. Handing at all speeds is precise without being overly sensitive, and the 2.5L engine is powerful (and economical) enough for me, having had a S 2004 2.5S Altima sedan. I cannot say enough about the Continental tires - they grip tenaciously in wet weather and are quiet. Trunk space is very limited so you may need to put stuff in the rear seat. Smaller folk should be able to access the rear seat, but adults will find it difficult to enter and exit. The rear visibility is limited.","Excellent handling and steering, CVT transmission, interior and exterior styling, sound system with Bose speakers, and fuel economy. ","When the ""keyless"" fob is not in the vicinity of the vehicle, the doors should lock automatically. Trunk could be larger. Movable exterior heated mirrors on the 2.5L would have been nice.  "
4.875,Great car at an affordable price,Kaya ,07/19/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Very happy w/ the purchase. Looking at a G35 but went w/ a loaded Altima Coupe 3.5 SE and saved 8K. Not one that needs to have the status of owning a G35. Heard the Altima Coupe is a ""poor mans"" G35, I say it's a wise mans for those not into status symbols and for those whom aren't professional drivers. Great car for the driver who wants to have a little driving fun at great price.",Every feature but (see below),"Front end design could be more sporty. Not sold on the chrome pieces on the front grill, however IMO, looks best on the darker colors. We got Slate so not too bad. Wished the wheels came 18"" stock on the 3.5 or at least offer wheel options.   "
5,Where has this car been???,rosborn ,07/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I recently purchased the Altima Coupe after going to my dealership to look at the Altima 4door. I saw the brochure and was smitten. I decided to wait until the sedan was released and I'm so glad I did. I added the Nav and Premium pkg. It rides like a dream. It's excellent on gas and has turned heads everywhere I go. I usually hear it looks like the GS but looks even better. This was the best car purchase I've ever made and I've made plenty.,"Navigation system, Bluetooth and leather seats. I also love the CVT. I got the 2.5 liter who needs the 3.5?? It picks up speed just as fast and you can only go so fast living in the big city like I do. ","Trunk space is very sparse, not many options as of yet. Would love to get an optional grille, but none are available as of yet. Not many colors available at dealership, if you see one you like, pick it up!! Trust me, if you wait, it won't be there when you get back. "
4.875,The coupe,thegooddr ,07/08/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I got 2.5 with CVT and convenience pkg. Great power, excellent ride, handles well, and gorgeous. The car is better than I expected. I got it for style, but it is also a great ride. Economy, according to the computer is 23 around the city, and will go over 400 miles on a tank. Only an economy car will do that.","CVT, looks, ride, performance.","Automatic locking of doors, climate control standard."
4.875,Performance + Features + Looks = Awesome,Scott in SF ,07/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've had the car for two weeks and couldn't be happier. The V6 CVT engine is quite the performer and it's great not having the ""shifting gears"" feel on conventional automatics.  The turning is phenomenal. The car both looks and feels sporty. I got the performance and tech package and the quality of the interior feels like a upper end luxury car.  The fuel economy for a 270hp 3.5L is rather decent (who needs a hybrid). The best part about the looks of the car is the back of it (have to see it in person). I like having all of the accessories put into two packages instead of 20+ add ons. Anyone in the market for a two door coupe should definitely test drive an Altima coupe.",Remote keyless entry and push button start.  Auxiliary audio jack (works great with the iPod.  Steering wheel mounted controls.  Navigation system and rear view mounted camera.  Auto dimming mirror.  Bluetooth for mobile phone.  The fold down seats make decent cargo capacity an easy possibility.,I would have liked a bigger cargo net for the trunk instead of the small one that came with it (not that big of a deal though).
5,Great,altimacpe08 ,07/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is definitely the best car I test drove and finally bought. There is nothing I don't like about the car. Comparing this car to the Mazda6, Dodge Avenger/Charger and Audi4, this car blows them away with style and performance. Even though I have the V4 for CVT, I feel more power driving this than in any Acura or just any car I have driven. Easily said, Nissan has made a car that will be a collectors item in the years ahead.",I think everything about this car is perfect.,There should be 16 inch wheels standard and not just wheel covers. And there should be running lights instead of the plastic indents. Also the Bose stereo system should not require the SE package.
5,Nissan's Best Kept Secret,bighat ,07/01/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We test drove it a few weeks ago, and that set the high water mark. Almost bought a Lexus IS 250 for $4k more, but the Altima coupe is much more fun to drive, plus has more rear legroom!",Power. Handling. Styling. Price. Comfort. Features.  Build quality. Torque steer virtually non-existent! CVT is way cool. 6spd is almost as fast as the previous 350Z! Altima coupe comes dangerously close to eclipsing the Infiniti coupe. (Oops! better keep my mouth shut.),"Offer beige leather with exterior colors other than electro blue and arrestme red. If you're preoccupied with fuel economy, get the 4cyl. Wheels are too narrow, and styling isn't flattering. Too much gap between tires and fender lips. Obnoxious grill emblem."
4.875,It looks like a high performance car. ,rambosky ,06/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I was taken by the sporty looks of the coupe.  I thought it looked better than the 350Z.  I got the premium package which included leather seats, sun roof, alloy wheels and Bose sound system.  It handles better than other sports cars I've driven which cost $10K more. The shiftless CVT is awesome.   Can't wait til I drive it again.",Automatic dual zone climate control. Keyless entry. CVT.

4.625,First Nissan Altima Coupe in Western WA,Kelly in Tacoma ,06/12/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,4,4,5,5,"I have had my 2008 Altima Coupe for 1 1/2 weeks now and I LOVE IT! It's my first brand new car and it handles perfect! I have driven 280+ miles (it had 20 when I left the lot. I bought it the day after the dealer received it) and I feel like it was made for me. I haven't had that feeling of ""oops I'm going around that corner too fast"" like I did in my other cars/SUVs. It's such a smooth ride, and doesn't have that small compact feel like most sports cars, but it is soooo nice to look at. The backseat is roomy, and there is lots of leg room up front. It has lots of power and get-up-and-go for only 4 cylinders.","I love the push button starter, along with the electronic push button entry with the sensor. There are lots of cubby holes for storage. It has 20"" rims and that in combination with the sleek sexy look makes heads turn and I can feel the envy!","The only improvement I can see (this early) is to have the trunk be a little bigger. If we have to pack more than a few duffel bags, I'm not sure if it will fit. It's pretty deep from front to back, but from top to bottom, it's pretty shallow."
5,I think I'm in love with this thing.,russellusm ,05/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I love the overall feel of the car, inside and out.  I owned an 03 Altima and I must say that Nissan has stepped it up a notch the the design of this car.  The interior is very plush and the control are nice and simple.  The instrument cluster is nicly laid out (not too busy).  The acceleration is pretty good for a grocery getter.  I have gotten a lot of looks.  This car turns heads.  Good job Nissan.",The glove box is surprisingly large.  You can fit 2 shoe boxes in it.  The sheer look of the car is what was the selling point for me.,"I would have the push-button start removed and replaced with a conventional key start.  I'm paranoid that the FOB will get wet, damaged or have the battery die and I will be stuck in a parking lot somwhere."
