I've only replaced tires at $900 twice, changed the oil regularly, and so far I've never had to put it in the shop for repairs. We change the battery and brake pads, just maintenance. It's going to get a tune up tomorrow, and I hope it improves the gas mileage. For now city 19, and highway 21 to 23.  Also, pulling the boat it gets 16 mpg, but it pulls very well. I hope it keeps up with reliability because I have yet to find anything else I like as well as my Highlander.","Favorite feature how the car handles on ice and sand. When I push the snow button it feels like it drops slightly and grips the road very well.

Rear window wiper motor, sunroof, NAV system had to be replaced. The lugs nuts are two piece shells and loose it's cap each time you remove a lug nut. I forced the dealer to replace them at his cost every time he rotated the wheels. The tires cost about $1400 (poor choice and expensive) and regardless of the warranty they last only a mere 19K. The tire size is limited to two manufactures and thus the high price. Got stuck in snow and had to reverse the SUV to get out. Embarrassing to say the least for an SUV. Lastly, the traction control truly does not work, it slides everywhere. ","Automatic hatch, under carriage lights, keyless entry, hitch, and spacious interior.",Hopefully the NAV system has been improved due to the lack of POI and functionality. It does not justify the 2K extra in the GPS features as I can buy at the time a GPS for only $200 and will have loads of other features that are essential while traveling. Never again purchase an auto with GPS! They need to choose good gripping and long lasting tires for this or any of their vehicles that are made by many manufacturers to keep the costs down. Must have been some sort of business deal with Toyo and Bridgestone to get the suckers who like to spend their money. Not a sucker any more.

One thing to be careful with on this vehicle- it's very easy to lose track of how fast you're going. The smooth, quiet ride doesn't communicate the fact that you're going 25 over very well :D That being said, I would own one of these.

The car is great, the problem is with the original tires (toyo open country A20) wore out at 18000 miles.  Replaced them with four brand new Bridgestone Duelers HL 400. ($900.00).  These tires are equally as bad and down right dangerous in snow/wet conditions.  I am now purchasing a set of winter tires for the car (bridgestone Blizzak DM-V1 (another $900.00).  Sure the car is great. Good luck finding a tire for the car that works in the ice and snow. This is too bad for such a highly rated car. Is it the fault of the tires or Toyotas fault for choosing such an odd size tire/tire design fault.

I have sailed through three intersections; did a 360 spin in a roundabout doing 20mph with an inch of snow on the ground; came within  a hair of hitting a utility truck in a snow filled parking lot; and have spun around while turning a corner. I live in the northeast with snow from November to March. On 1/14/10 my dealer said, ""Can't find a problem and -no- snow tires are not the answer.""

Yes, there are some issues in the snow with sliding, but this issue is not the vehicle, but rather the tires available for the Limited model's 19 inch wheels.  Only 2 manufacturers make good tires for this vehicle, and with a lower profile tire, you won't have the traction you would have from a 17 inch or smaller wheel.  The ride and gas mileage (23mpg avg.) are great.  Some rattling noises from the dashboard in the cold when hitting bumps.  Overall I'm very pleased with this vehicle.

Problem is worsened by availability of only 1 other factory sized alternative, a Bridgestone with an equally bad snow rating. Out of actual fear of factory tire snow traction during past two winters, I switched to 235-55x19 Yokohamas (at only 16,000 miles) with much better snow results thus far. Treadwear on factory tire was also very poor, and I drive in suburban traffic at 35-45 miles per hour  I may be forced to full snows if Yokos prove no better than Toyos after mileage accumulates.

I got this truck in June of '08 when nobody was making any kind of deals, and finding a reasonable lease was impossible from any manufacturer. I'm amazed by this truck. It has plenty of power, a ton of room in the back for gear. The third row seat is a little small, but its great for my small kid (Girl 6yrs, Boy 2yrs).

There is something really wrong with the AWD transmission on these cars.  It hesitates about 5 seconds when you need it to accelerate, stopped on a hill, gave a loud ""clump"" then went up hill.  Transmission cannot keep up with computer is my thinking.  Toyota will not admit any problems, been to shop twice.  Car lurches while trying (slowly) to change gears, can be dangerous while trying to enter a freeway, hope no one gets killed due to this problem.  Also, knobs, rubber is falling off, radio bad.

The steering wheel is very tight and turns in a small circle, I love it.  Thank you to everyone else who wrote a review, it really helped my decision to buy a highlander. I would recommend a highlander, my husband is now looking at the Tundra. I guess we'll be a Toyota Family. ","I love how much power it has, I was very surprised.  The back seats have a ton of leg room.  My husband is 6'2 and drives with the seat fully back and the passenger still has plenty of leg room.  Also we got the Toyota Certified with 7 years 100,000 miles and roadside for the same amount of time! ",A little more room for cargo would be nice.

I was skeptical of the Highlander's 5000lbs tow rating. Now after 11000 miles and several months of towing our 4000lbs 21 ft ski boat I am the Highlander's biggest fan. It pulls and stops our boat better than my Grand Cherokee ever did. Plus this is the most comfortable and solidly built car I have ever owned.

It's very irritating.  My Toyota dealership said it is a gas saving computer thing and the only way to correct it is to drive more aggressively around corners.

The captains chair option with stowaway middle seat is truly novel and well executed.  I have two toddlers so the other vehicles in the category that would force you to take out one of the car seats from the second row to get access to the 3rd row just didn't work for me.  It has all the bells and whistles I wanted like the rear camera, nav system and heated seats and is super well though out inside.  It looks good outside too.

The Highlander is very roomy and the second row is great. The captains chairs are awesome. XM have the dealer do it or if you want to save $100 bucks buy the parts from the dealer, then take the parts to a stereo shop for installation.

I am very pleased with all of the vehicles functions. My only real complaint is that in very cold weather the vehicle needs to be warmed up before driving otherwise it makes a lot of noise and has a major loss of power.  My Subaru Outback that I traded in never did that in any temperature weather.

After one year, I couldn't be happier. The ride is quiet and comfortable with plenty of room, visibility is great, plenty of power, and fuel economy for a midsize SUV is fantastic, we got 26 mpg on a trip to Florida last year.

With the exception of the Blue Ridge Parkway, I am impressed with the highway mileage. At one particular stretch of 80 miles, I averaged 29.4 MPG. Unbelievable!

Also tested '09 RAV4, which is a great little brother...","Tri-zone climate control, Backup camera, folding second row seats that stow from tailgate area, Bluetooth, decent stereo, large, bright controls, so much room in the second row--sat back there and had 4-5 inches between knees and the front seat (and I'm 6'2""), second row reclines",Make mud guards/running boards standard; tone down wheels just a little bit; Michelin tires should come standard on this vehicle... mine had Bridgestone Duelers. Don't let any of these stop you from buying. This is an awesome vehicle that deserves a look... can't beat Toyota quality.
5,Very Impressed!,new highlander owner ,12/02/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We bought the 2008 Highlander - upsizing from a 1999 Honda CRV.  Needed more space with new baby and 2 dogs.  It is great!  Very comfortable, gas mileage is decent - about the same as my Honda but this is a larger vehicle and a V6.  The V6 is impressive.  We took the Highlander to the mountains for the first time and hit a patch of ice unexpectedly and started to slide.  It reacted quickly and self stabilized, with the added kinda distracting feature of warning noises.     ",Surprisingly good turning radius.  Very comfortable drive and ride.  Thoughtful interior lighting that automatically turns on.  Self-stabilizing and AWD.,The Honda CRV had many thoughtful storage compartments.  I wish the Highlander had them as well.  The headrests could be redesigned and for the $$$ I'd like to have an exterior temp thermometer.  Better gas mileage is always appreciated.
5,Great car!,Tracey ,11/27/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The power is great! The car is very roomy, with great features, with the back seat able to be turned in to bucket seats.

4.875,Great vehicle to own and drive,BillU ,11/24/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I have owned this vehicle for about a year and replaced an 05 Pathfinder. This has more power, handles better and gets better fuel economy. The only thing I don't like is the hesitation on acceleration. I didnt notice it much at first but now I realize that when I round a corner and push on the gas, it takes awhile before it responds. You need to be aware of this before you purchase. The other strange part was adding a towing package but not getting the hitch. I found an aftermarket that works great. This is one of the best all around vehicles I have ever owned.","Engine power, leather seats, power liftgate, interior room.","Remove hesitation from drive by wire, split 3rd row seat, memory seat on limited, standard tow hitch with package."
4.75,Very Happy and the right size,Bryan ,11/21/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Owned the Limited AWD for about 3 months. Gas mileage low 18.1 high 27.2. Average since purchase is 21.5. Excellent mileage on long trips. Like the size, not too big or too small and the step-in height is also very comfortable. Reminds me of the size of my old 1998 Explorer but nicer in every way. Engine louder during warmup, very quiet thereafter.  Smooth ride, quiet interior, and good gas mileage for its size (mid-sized) were my top 3 requirements and it has lived up to my expectations thus far.  ","Push button start, Bluetooth, reclining back seats. Body side moldings, somehow it makes the vehicle much better looking. Dual entry rear door very useful. (Hard to find on vehicles these days.)","Illuminate the lock/unlocks and all window controls not just driver window. Memory seats. More control over the daylight running lights.

5,Very Happy With Purchase,Jim S ,11/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've only been driving the Highlander for about a month, but so far I'm very happy with it. I'm amazed at how good the gas mileage is, especially considering how much power it has. Even better gas mileage than the 05 Highlander that I traded. I bought the 2 wheel drive model not only to save money, but also because its better on gas, and requires less maintenance than the 4 wheel drive model. My only real complaint is the 55 series 19"" tires that come standard on the Limited model. The 19"" wheels look great, but one good look at the Bridgestones tell you that they're not well suited for snow or ice. I've already purchased 4 Blizzaks and alloy wheels for the winter months.",Much more leg room than the old model. Great engine and smooth shifting transmission. Quiet ride. Very good gas mileage. Bluetooth. Back-up camera. JBL sound system. Power lift gate. Push button start. Three way climate control. Heated front seats. ,"Make 19"" wheels optional on all models due to the fact that the 245-55-19 Bridgestones aren't well suited for snow and ice even on the 4 wheel drive model.

4.875,No Buyer Remorse,Dave ,11/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded in 2007 Toyota Prius with 24,000 miles and purchased new 2008 Base Highlander with max out options. We got great gas mileage on Prius avg on 24,000 miles was 45 MPG. Great car just not the car I wanted to drive in the winter in CO.  We have driven the Highlander only 3,279 miles 80% city 20% highway. Average 19.9 MPG. High of 25.6 in the mountains and highway and low of 17.7 in city. This a average 16 tanks of gas. That is 165 gal of gas on 3,279 miles driven or 19.9 MPG.  I'm happy having much more extensive comfort and control on snow covered roads in the winter. (No Buyers Remorse.)

Needing 5000lb towing for smaller farm duties, grinding out daily one-hour commutes with speed and good gas mileage (18.8-21.0 depending on driving style) and great 2nd row passenger leg and head room (I'm 6-2) no one in the family is complaining. Bought the Base AWD. Added leather and tow hitch. Still almost too nice for utility work. Toyotas should hold up quality-wise. If it does, this one will be with me until one of us take a rest!","Passing-power, 5000lbs tow capacity, interior space 2nd row, usable 3rd row for light traveling, new body-style compared to 4-Runner, gas mileage (you will get at least 17mpg if you really pound it). Low cost of maintenance.",Add exterior thermo gauge inside the instrument cluster. Get rid of the film that builds fairly quickly on the inside of the front windshield (as is the case for other Toyotas I've owned).

4.875,Drive it for yourself and see,Happy Toyota Owner ,10/16/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"It took a while for us to drive a bunch of the SUVs closely resembling the Highlander.  Before test driving several vehicles I had already sold myself on an Acadia.  After the test drive the obvious winners were the 2009 Pilot and Toyota Highlander.  We had looked at the Highlander a couple of years back but it was smaller and the dash was just plain ugly.  The new redesign and the plush drive just did us both in.  The Pilot would have offered a little more room but the dash looks like its made out of cheap plastic, and unless you get the all black interior the two tone effect was not very appealing to us.  We have a family of 4 so we can leave the third row down and use when needed.","Look and feel of dash (not a fan of wood so we opted for the Sport model), actual usable 3rd row, MPG in HWY is actually as advertised or higher - got 27-28 on 1300 Mile drive back home from the state where I picked it up, Power Lift Gate, rear view camera.  Overall it exceeds our expectations.","Nicer Xenon headlights, make it a little wider so that you can lay a 4x8 sheet flat in the rear like you can on the Pilot, automatic folding mirrors, split 3rd row."

We are retired, so don't drive to work or school, & have very low mileage since we bought it after Thanksgiving 2007. It is so quiet you get up to speed fast! Response is great and shifting is very smooth. We got the Sport with 2-row seating, and love the generous cargo space in back with storage compartments below and tonneau cover above. Had no trouble getting a 37"" LCD TV box into it with one 2nd row split seat down, and the other seat propping the TV upright for transporting.","Very smooth shifting. Very large glove compartment. Lots of cup holders! A/C & heater work very well. Backup camera handy, except in bright sunlight when it's hard to see the screen.",The 2007 model front console had storage room underneath for a purse.

4.875,Excellent SUV,AGB ,09/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I've had the truck for about a month & am very satisfied. I traded in a Lexus ES 350 because I needed something bigger with 4 wheel drive.

Very quiet easy driving, but view out the back is much worse than my 2004.  See comment below about the miserable head rests.","Quiet soft ride, quiet powerful engine.  Made in Japan","Better fuel economy.  Change head rest design.  My 09 Corolla & this Highlander both have very uncomfortable headrests, making your head tilt forward all the time no matter the adjustments you make.  I miss my 2004's head rests."
5,An Awesome SUV!,Daniel K ,08/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Well, I really liked our 2005 Highlander, but, this 2008 Highlander is simply awesome - really.  The exceptionally smooth and quiet ride, powerful engine, and very good gas mileage for the size of the vehicle is without question class best!  A recent 1500 mile road trip was the easiest and most relaxing trip I have ever experienced in over 40 years of driving.  The sport package handles well, not too stiff, adding to the driving pleasure.  This vehicle is the best looking SUV on the planet, lots of ""stares"" from other drivers.  The cabin is very comfortable, controls properly positioned, adding to the driving experience.  Toyota cleverly combined features of a sedan, SUV, and minivan!  ","The sport package provides superior ride and handling.  The exterior appearance-simply the best!  The 440 watt JBL stereo system sounds great.  The dual climate control systems (front and rear seats) works wonderful.  The 19"" wheels look great.  Multi-function display provides handy information.    ",The only thing I would suggest is to better design the satellite radio antenna (presently mounted on the dash in front of the driver) and relocate it outside (on top) of the vehicle for better appearance and reception quality.

Sport suspension stiffer than base and Limited. I prefer stiffer. Able to select transmission gearing, a plus for towing. Second seats can be moved forward and aft as well as folded flat. Rear auto door is a real plus for convenience. ","Steering wheel controls for  stereo, AC and display. Rear auto door, back up camera and mileage displays.

4.25,Met Expectations,Jim ,08/19/2008,,,4,5,3,5,,4,5,4,4,"This vehicle was purchased because of the towing package option - allowing for a 5,000 lb towing capacity which exceeded most other crossover vehicles of similar size.  The vehicle has performed well in the first 9 months.  However, initial electrical wiring problems required the vehicle to be returned to the dealer for repairs early on.","Navigation system, heated seats, back- up camera","Add drivers seat memory.

4.75,Great vehicle.,Patrick ,08/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I traded my '02 Ford Windstar for a 2008 4WD Base Highlander.  I have driven the Highlander about 1,000 miles so far.  The Highlander is much nicer to drive, has more power, and gets better MPG (around 21 MPG in mixed city/urban interstate driving).  The only downside is less space behind the 3rd row seats.

Took it in a month later to service dept. and they were really nice but say nothing is wrong. I've been thru this kind of song and dance with another manufacturer before so I know that the consumer has to stay on top of it.  Another concern is lag on acceleration - shifting from 1 to 2 gear. It's like the car has to think about what it wants to do so it pauses. Steering radius (turning into parking spaces) is not great, while driving on highway steering squishy. ","Sport has just enough niceties for me without overcharge, auto close tailgate, 6 disc cd, auto light system, 3rd row seat, glove box is the best rm i have ever had in any vehicle. Roomy.

The Highlander rides like a high end luxury sedan but offers much more room in the interior and a very comfortable ride.  I like the new exterior design that just came out. We never gave the Highlander a second look until the new 2008 style. The Highlander is my first Toyota purchase and I will likely buy another again. ,"The Highlander provides you with a smooth ride much like a sedan, very roomy!  Lots of storage in rear for large items.","Rear hatch back door very heavy and hard to close.  The rear door should also have access with a key.

At 6'3""+ it just wasn't happening so we decided to step up a level and are we ever glad we did. As soon as I stepped in and sat down I knew it was just a matter of convincing my wife.  That didn't take long either because I let her drive it first. In the short period of time we have had it we have shuttled up to 7 people around, surprisingly comfortably and they have all commented about both the ride and the quiet. I suffer from back problems and the driver's seat seems to sense that, allowing multiple adjustments and the relaxation of variable heat. What a wonderful addition to the family! Try it!","Interior space, smooth and quiet ride, mix of power and decent mileage (20-25 mpg so far), ability to easily change seating configuration.

Note this is not a sports car however. Seats are very comfortable. This is going to be fabulous family trip car.  Can't wait for our first big trip. I wanted this car be be everything and it is: the comfy ride of a sedan, cargo space of a van, and style.  Toyota has done it again.  On my first gas up I got 22.5 MPG in mixed driving. Not bad.

Traded in a Honda Minivan as the kids are a bit older.  This is a very comfortable ride with respectable power for what it is.  The ride is a little soft but expected for what we were considering which is a vehicle to drive around town on surface roads doing errands.  Very nice interior with many features that are in higher end vehicles.  Front seats are very roomy and there is a ton of room in the 2nd row both in the large seats and large amount of legroom. Third seat is similar to other vehicles in this class.  Cargo room with the third seat up is small as a large grocery trip will tax the space. ",High end features of the car.  Walk through capability to 3rd row (and stow away seat)  Very roomy 2nd row.  Well laid out dash and audio/air controls.  You do not have to search around the controls and they are very intuitive,"As said above, no split third row seat and no power in center console.

Our previous car was a Chevy Tahoe which sat in our driveway most of the time being such a gas guzzler.  We tried the Honda Pilot 2008 (we have a 2000 civic) & found it didn't compare with the Highlander.  We needed the towing capacity plus smooth traveling ride & storage. We have the lighted running boards which are wonderful.  I have short legs & love the lighting at nite to get into the car.  The console in front & the lighted panel have all the bells & whistles you need when on the road.  WE JUST LOVE THE CAR!,The roominess of the interior. Lots of leg room for tall people.  Lighted control panel.  Seats are very comfortable.  Front seat console a dream. Gas mileage is a real plus.,"There is a blind spot by the left rear view mirror which is really a problem for me since I am only 5'3"".  When turning left I seem to come to close to the medians.

5,Another great Toyota!,Chicagoland area ,07/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Spent 3 months researching all the SUVs. Don't know why I bothered when Toyota builds the best out there!  No complaints, not even about the 3rd row head rest or the lack of memory seats. 3rd row head rest are always down and my wife is the only one that drives the car.  I love the European style shifting. It adds a lot of fun to the drive when you want to drive the back roads.  I didn't expect any luggage space with a 3rd row for this size of SUV but you have some.  Engine and handling remind me of my 99 Lexus ES300.  My 5th Toyota and not my last one!",The European style shifting.

No regrets - two thumbs up!",Most comfortable seat of about a dozen different brands I tried.  Gas mileage is very competitive for size vehicle.,My only complaint is the transmission does not down-shift smoothly unless you come to a complete or near complete stop.

4.25,2008 Toyota Highlander Base FWD,Toyota Joe ,06/28/2008,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"I went looking for a sensible SUV and found it. I didn't need 4WD in the area I live in nor do I have kids, let alone 5, so I opted out of the 3rd row seat. The V6 has all the power I need though torque steer is somewhat noticeable. I'm 6 foot, yet there's plenty of room. The center dash/console is so well laid out, I felt as if it was made for me. Steering position is good, feel is a little soft though. Braking is OK, a bit soft as well. Transmission is super smooth, but an extra gear would be nice for a bump up in fuel economy. You may have noticed my 8 rating for economy, I'll explain below.","The Snow button. I haven't a clue what it does, but I use it all the time. It feels likes it simply cuts power down. With a very light foot, tire pressure at 38, and Snow mode on, I get 22/28. The 28 was received after a 900 mile round trip at 65 MPH.  At 55 MPH, I could get 30 MPG. Hybrid who? ","The ""S-Mode"" shift feature is basically useless. You can't start out in second which would be great combined with snow mode, and while accelerating in higher gears, it just down-shifts like any other transmission. What's the point!?

The only thing that we have problem is that this model is equipped with Toyo Open Country A 20 P245/55R19 103S tires which are almost impossible to find.  We got two flat tires while parked at a garage a few weeks ago - one tire is repairable and the other one isn't since the nail is near the sidewall.  No tire center has this specific tire in stock.

I researched for 6 months before deciding that the Highlander was the best crossover SUV.  I chose the Highlander over the Subaru Tribeca, my second choice SUV, because of gas mileage and the larger gas tank in the Highlander.  I've been driving the Highlander for over a week and must say that the ride is smooth and quiet and it is very comfortable.  So far I have absolutely no complaints.

I always liked Toyotas but did not like the prevous Highlander.  When the redesigned Highlander came out I figured the time was right to get one.  My biggest disappointment was the navigation system.  First the way it is packaged becomes an expensive option as you have to get the rear seat entertainment system with it.  Second, you can only put information in it when the car is stopped which really makes using it aggravating.  Third, it is a complicated system and fails to find a number of streets that it should.  The system in my wife's Honda is much better.","Interior design, roominess inside, quality of materials, relative fuel economy.",Navigation system.

That was the summer of 2007 and all has been fine till the car turned 8 months old. Now the radio doesn't change volume or doesn't turn on at all in 60% of the cases.

Pleased with the design and drivability - comfort is excellent as I am 6 ft, 3 in.  Very much like the smart key system and the functionality.  Very displeased with the electronics.  Satellite radio requires a very expensive and labor intensive installation - I obviously didn't read carefully enough or I would have likely purchased a different vehicle.  In order to install satellite radio the dealer indicates that the headliner has to be removed - even a seat removed.  WHAT WAS TOYOTA THINKING?  The GPS mapping system lacks detail - I live in a city of 40,000 and most of the side streets aren't noted.

I now have over 4200 miles on the vehicle and MPG for around town driving averages 21.5.  I recently took a 1500 mile road trip (mostly interstate) and got 27.65 mpg.  Although I miss having cruise and radio/CD controls on the steering wheel and a trip mileage meter these are minor inconveniences.  My Highlander handles extremely well and the 3.5L 6cyl flat out gets up and goes when you need a little extra power.  A minor irritant is the rear hatch is difficult to handle without using both arms (hopefully I won't require shoulder replacement surgery).  Excellent value all around.,"Overall style, comfort and roominess.  Front seats were very comfortable for my wife and I on our recent road trip.

I am 5-10 and my husband is 6-2 and we do not feel cramped at all.  My husband was skeptical because it looks smaller on the outside than it really is.

4.625,My 2 Cents,Brian ,05/04/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I purchased a Highlander Limited about 3 months ago.  My wife is the primary driver and she is satisfied with the purchase but does not enjoy the Highlander as much as her previous Nissan Murano.  We needed a 3rd row so we were forced to get something new.  Her main complaint is how close she must sit to the steering wheel to reach the pedals.  She is about 5' 5"" and she sits about 5 inches away from the steering wheel, the Murano had adjusted pedals which allowed her to sit back more.  Her only other complaint is how loose feeling the steering is, I personally like the effortless steering, but she prefers a little more feedback from the car.  Other then that we are happy with the purchase.","Push button start, if you have not had a car with it, you don't know what you are missing. The key fob never leaves your pocket!  Bluetooth is a nice and the rest of the interior feel luxurious. ",Adjustable pedals and memory seats.

My average in town is 21 mpg (only 10% hwy). We live in Houston so we did not need or want AWD and did not choose the third row seat.

First, the acceleration is not what I'd expect from a 270-hp engine, even given the vehicle's weight. Second, the transmission makes me crazy. From a rolling start, the transmission doesn't upshift quickly enough from first to second, resulting in an awkward ""pull.""

It's a little too touchy/boosted.  I'd rater have a little more road feel.  But it does turn on a dime.

Unfortunately, it did not live up to the high expectations. My gas mileage has been well below the posted 17/22. It has been 11/18 (18 after the car was repaired).  Last month, the car would not start. It took five tries and pushing the gas to finally get it started. There was smoke and a burnt smell coming out my engine area. It took the dealership almost three day to figure out the problem, that being a faulty injector. Very frustrating process, poor service from both the selling dealership and Toyota's 800 customer satisfaction line. I find it ironic that our Chevy Silverado, now 6 years old has never needed a repair.","The aesthetics. Beautiful Blizzard Pearl color. Nice roomy interior. Control panel, easy to navigate.

Did 4 months of research (Edmunds, Cars.com, Vehix, CR) all rated the car well despite new design. Choice between Pilot & Highlander.  Pilot was a little too utilitarian and mpg ratings fr: blogs dissuaded me.  I made the right choice.

In addition, the highlander can move the seats and contains much more room inside. ","I think that the 3rd row is the best. You can actually put it up or down, without having to have it split.

We were looking at 4-runners, Honda Pilots and Suburu Outbacks. I originally felt that the Highlander looked too much like a van (from the inside) and did not even want to test drive it, but after a week of looking around I agreed to try it. Needless to say it was a fabulous test drive and I could not be happy with the ride of the 4-runner or the Honda Pilot. The Outback is a great drive as well but for the money you get a lot more vehicle with the Highlander. I have had it for a week now and my husband and I both love it.

I was surprised by the amount of power I get from the V6 engine.  Loaded with 5 adults and 2 children it didn't hesitate on hills at all. Very comfortable inside. Love the automatic rear door. Mileage has been about 21-22 MPG in mixed 70% freeway and 30% city driving.  Interior cargo room is adequate with the third row folded though I have a Yakima roof box for long trips or when using all three rows.  That was my trade off for not getting a Suburban for the few times I really needed the extra space inside.  Ride is a little soft but that may be because I was used to a truck and 15 MPG.,Versitility of the second row seating: Captain chairs with tilt or bench seat. Power rear door.

4.75,New '08 Highlander FWD,Dale ,01/21/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,5,4," Purchased the '08 Highlander FWD on Thursday. Very solid and well built vehicle, with a powerful V-6 engine and well matched 5 speed automatic. The interior is upscale and flawless. I also have a leased '05 Sienna van, and the ride is very similar. I noticed the power steering is slightly overboosted, and could give a little more effort and road feel, but that is the nature of the electrically assisted steering, as opposed to the older hydraulic power steering. As noted by others, the liftgate is on the heavy side, and requires some effort to close. My Sienna has never been back to the dealer, I do my own oil changes and brake pads (very easy), and I expect this Toyota to be as reliable. "," The seating position is very good, there are no blind spots, and the interior is very well put together. This crossover SUV is quiet and solid.

The Chevy lacked many refined details available in the toyota. Rear back up camera, well designed interior, and overall attention to detail compelled us to buy Toyota.  I am not complaining about the gas mileage, overall it's right at 21 MPG. The automatic rear hatch door is just fantastic.

It's been many years since I've driven a car with a noteciably poor transmission but when starting off going down hill (which is how our drive is situated) this transmission is rough. You can see the RPMs reving then hear and feel the transmission catch up. I took it into the dealership but they claim that is the way it is supposed to be. I've never had a problem with a car until I bought this Highlander and really wouldn't recommend it,The exterior styling is pleasing. I must sound like a grumpy person but that's not the case. This is the first time I've been displeased with a car purchase and I'm finding that it is deeply disappointing and constantly annoying.,"Make the rear door easier to close. Improve the transmission.

I started with the ever reliable Corolla that I had for 12 years and 120,000 miles until I passed it on to my niece. Then in 2001, I was one of the first to buy the newly introduced Highlander. It was an instant love affair. I've had it for 6.5 years and it just hit 96,000 miles. It has had very minor problems or issues. I decided to upgrade to the 2008 even though the new design hasn't grown on me as quickly. I am also finding the ""electronic"" steering is taking some getting used to and I can really feel the changing of gears in this vehicle much more than my old highlander. I am not totally in love with my new highlander but I am hoping it's just the transition.","More room, smoother ride and the pretty, periwinkle color known as bluewave pearl or something to that effect. Love all the cup holder spaces.",I am really having a hard time with the back door latch and the closing of the hatch door. It is a heavier door than my last highlander. They should offer that automatic assist in all models like they have in the 4Runner. I just liked the hatch door opener so much better on my 2001 highlander
4.875,So Far a winner!,Bruce ,12/13/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"A month and 1800 miles + and we love our new Highlander. The wide luxury ride took a little getting used to after a 95 GMC Jimmy and an 89 Pathfinder but it is a pleasure to drive especially on longer trips. I do not find any discomfort in the seats. Controls are well placed, interior design is good. Features seem to be well thought out and well placed. This is the first ""luxury"" vehicle I have ever owned and I think I have spoiled myself. Not an off road vehicle but I expect it to be good in bad weather. Love the nav, rear dvd for the kids, and aux input on the stereo for the ipod. The visibility seems excellent and  I am expecting same Toyota quality I had in my Fav 84 Celica. Very happy!","Keyless entry, rear camera, plenty of head/legroom. Lots of cargo room with third row stowed. Nav seems to be very accurate. Rear power gate. Programmable buttons for garage doors plenty of storage space/cup holders.  Like the small display information especially fuel economy info.","Better manual. Some features had to be played with to discover how they work especially voice controls. Mileage, althought good for suv, could be better. Override to keep audio system screen display on longer in some modes. More availability of accesories (cargo mat, rain guards)"
4.875,The best third row SUV so far,Edward ,12/13/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The 2008 model is largely improved in size, horse power and gas mileage. 4x4 runs very smooth. Three-zone AC is better than Lexus I have. To really enjoy the car, youd better have new technologies such as voice controlled GPS, blue tooth and MP3 build-in. That means you must have navigation option. I think it cannot be called GPS option. It is a command center. With the screen, you will edit your phone book, select music from MP3 list, or check who is calling when your cell phone is ring. The new device let me thinking to sell my wife's 2004 Lexus and get a new car with similar device.",Comfortable seating; 4x4; Backward video camera; voice controlled GPS; voice controlled blue tooth and audio devices; steeling wheel with many easy control buttons; three-zone AC.,Second and third row design can be improved with removable seats.  
4.75,We love it,Kevin ,12/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"We wanted to graduate out of our wagon. Our decision came down to Mazda CX-9, Hyunda Veracruz, and the Highlander. The Veracruz seemed a little more luxurious, but we were hesitant about reliability/resale. The best part about the Highlander is that there was nothing in the ""con"" list except maybe initial price. But take into account resale, and that goes away.",Stowable middle seat / captains chairs. Very easy steering. Push button start. Backup camera without Nav system. HUGE back seat. Looks great inside and out.,The upgraded JBL radio is HORRIBLE. FM sounds like AM. The third row seat should be split. Very little room behind third row seat.
4.75,LOVE our new Highlander!!,Paul & Mary ,12/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,We have had our new Highlander for 1 week now and we LOVE it.  It is a blast to drive and I feel safe inside it.

4.875,"So far, so GREAT",Flash ,12/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Bought this as the wife's new vehicle. It replaced her '00 Impala. What an upgrade!!! It is comfortable, quiet, and for a vehicle of it's considerable size and power, gets really good fuel mileage. We got every option except for the nav, and the rear seat DVD. We have portables of both, and didn't see the need to spend an extra $4k on just those 2 options. Excellent up front storage capability with a glove box almost big enough to fit a desktop computer.  Comfortable, versatile, and economical, everything we wanted, combined with Toyota's bulletproof reliability reputation. Our first Toyota, and we're hooked.","Backup camera, pushbutton start, electroluminescent gauges a la Lexus, power rear door, innovative second row seating that supports muptiple configurations, usable third seat, driver's seat thigh bolster. MP3 jack.","I suppose if I have to come up with a complaint, it would be that there is no programmable driver's seat memory that allows different drivers to set memories based on thier most comfortable positions.

4.75,Happy with 2nd Highlander & recommend,RWNJ ,12/04/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I traded my 2005 Highlander for a Classic Silver Metallic 2008.  Love the new looks!  Very happy with the improved braking, steering and overall power. Love the convenience of opening the rear hatch window. The ride and suspension are not quite as smoothe as my 2005 Limited was, but this is a sport suspension and the car now has 19 inch tires and larger base.  The new Limited felt about the same to me, so I went with the sporty look and happy with it.  I love the layout of the new controls, large and easy to find everything.  I miss the armrest.  Even the door side is too low to rest an arm on - I am 5'5"". Rear backup screen & the sensors I added are nice to have. Overall, thumbs up!","Homelink, appearance, comfortable seats, great breaks, controls on steering wheel, third row. ",Add armrests or raise the padded console and move a bit forward.  Availability of auto rear door lift and navigation without DVD in NJ region (my kids have their own cars!). Compass on rear view mirror in all versions.  Wish the MPG had improved with this model.
4.625,Very pleased,Dave ,12/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"I've been very happy with this vehicle.  It has many nice options and is quite comfortable.  The ride is very smooth and I like the overall design.  I'm not quite as happy with the gas mileage as I had expected in my stop and go trip to work, I'm lucky to get 17 or at best 18 mpg.  I'm very pleased with the interior upgrades that come with the limited, the materials are as nice as my Navigator and nicer than my former 4Runner.  I'm not thrilled with the steering, a bit soft.  And heavy accelerations isn't well accepted by this transmission...over-revs and down shifts too hard.  In regard to the steering and acceleration, I'd take the 4Runner any day, but overall other features make it even.","My absolute favorite features are the smart key, the configurable 2nd row, quality leather and woodgrain and jbl sound system. The Limited version is worth every penny.","Don't like, no let me say, despise the nav system. Not at all intuitive and impossible to figure out even with the manual and expensive.  Just bought a Garmen 660 for my wife's car, far superior in all regards at 25% the price. No good radio interface if you have the nav, makes me crazy"
5,Toyota Fan For Life!,S. Clemmons ,11/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have always driven Toyotas, and traded in my Avalon for this SUV.  To think that I was considering another SUV - really crazy.  I'm a single lady, and wasn't too crazy about the styling of the 2007 Highlander; looked like a family car.  But once I saw the 2008, I was totally surprised.  I have owned this car for 1 week and 1 day, and anticipate keeping it for a long time.  Great comfort, great gas mileage, and a fun car to drive.  The 2008 is indeed larger, and carries on the Toyota legacy of being a top quality vehicle.  And once you drive it, you won't need to test drive anything else.  Worth every penny I spent.",The wide seats and the overall space in this vehicle.  It's wonderful.  Great looking car also.  It handles beautifully.  The dashboard lights are night provide for good visibility.  And the small blue light that highlights the gear shift in the middle is a nice surprise.,I can't think of anything else I need.  I love my new Highlander!
4.25,Love It!,NHMountains ,11/22/2007,,,5,3,5,5,,4,4,4,4,We love our new 2008 Highlander. We were looking at the Honda Pilot but are very glad we went with the Highlander. Gas mileage is what you would expect for an SUV of this size but better than stated by Toyota. Living in the mountains I have used the downhill assist and it worked great. We also like the ability to switch to manual shift. It will come in handy this winter. Haven't used the snow button yet but will probably use it quite frequently this winter. We went with the base because the price of the additional features wasn't worth the extra money for us.,2nd row captain chairs & convertible bench seat. Audio jack for iPod or MP3 player. Plenty of cup holders. Lots of cargo space with 3rd row down.,Split 3rd row. Cloth heated seats. Rear lift gate too heavy.
4.75,A Great SUV,Pleased With HLNDR ,11/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I gave up my sports car for this SUV and have few regrets.  I sacrificed tight steering and handling and quick start off the light for a quieter, smoother, roomier car for me and my family.  In retrospect, I should have done this a long time ago.  The cargo space with easy fold seating is great for hauling away moderate cargo.  Even though it is higher off the ground, it's so much easier to put the baby seat in the second row.  The leather bucket seats in my old car were difficult to get in and out of.  The AWD is great. My RWD car was slipping all over the place.  Looked at Tribeca, Pathfinder, Enclave and Tahoe, but this one felt right for me.  Good price and good size.",Much quieter than my sports car.  Smooth ride.  Versatile cargo space.  AWD.  19 inch wheels look great.,"Improve gas mileage, but that's about it."
5,The Best Vehicle Available for 2008,Lyn ,11/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my first Toyota and what a wonderful experience.  I am a 48 year old grandmother who still needs a little fun in her life.  This vehicle fits the bill of not too large and not too small.  Perfect  for taking my children to college, loading groceries and simply a blast to drive.  Would highly recommend this car-based vehicle to everyone.  Past loves have been Expeditions, minivans and a sport car.  Best value and so much more.  I appreciate the car more each day.  Even my honda loving husband of 24 years enjoys driving it!  I love the stares when I drive it!!",Favorite feature is hard to pin down. This car is just so darn smartly designed.  I love the four cup holder up front.  Tons of room for extras.,I miss my overhead garage button programmed in my last vehicle. I hate going back to an opener.  This is my only disappointment.
4.875,SUV to seriously consider,Jim Burdette ,11/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Great car! Fuel economy is above average, I was hoping for terrific fuel economy. Fun to drive, power when needed, comfortable for longer trips. Many standard features are optional on other comparable SUVs. I am looking forward to winter driving to test the performance in snow.

5,CoachP's Highlander,CoachP ,11/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"As a man who has had 5 hip replacements and two knees, and was very happy with his two Odysseys, I was interested to look at the '08 Highlander.  What scared me off the CX-9 was no Mazda store in town, and questionable reliability.  I cannot be happier with the Toyota, nor with the way I was treated at the store (which I had never previously been in).  The styling is outstanding, everyone knows Toyota's quality, and the mileage has been good.","Service by dealer; fit and finish; loads of techno goodies; comfort for a person of my size (6'2"", 270) with my bad legs.","Bluetooth would have been nice, as would power tailgate (couldn't go the extra for the Limited)."
4.75,2008 Sport AWD,Max ,11/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"I have been looking for cars and reading their specs for 8 months.  I decided to wait for the 2008 Highlander and the Nissan Rogue. Although I loved the Rogue my husband complained that his knees/legs hit the center console!  I needed these things in a car: comfort, good economy for the vehicle size, takes regular unleaded gas, enough instant pickup to get on the freeway, decent warranty. The V-6 offers as much power as did my V-8 Mountaineer.  I am averaging 21 mpg so far. The comfort is not the best but better than most short seated cars in this price range.","Big car feel but still quick to handle. I like the heavy looking style. Great brakes. Good driver visibility. Heated seats, back up camera are great features. Display screen offers current MPG and miles left on the tank. Full sized spare. You can ""shift"" this automatic for great mountain driving.",Passenger seat (4-way) needs to be fully adjustable like the driver's side. Seats need more padding for longer trips. Body side molding should be standard.
5,Bigger is Better,JMcKayPA ,11/04/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I had an 05 Rav 4 which was a great little SUV, but the 08 Highlander that I've had for 3 weeks now is a lot more fun and a lot less cramped.  Very quiet on the highway, quick to accelerate and a very comfortable interior.  Took some getting used to with the bigger front. Love the radio with the 'sound adjustment' feature.  When the road gets loud, the radio goes up!","Comfortable, big seats. Good sound system. Seat ground height allows for easy entrance. Heated wiper area on windshield.",Would like to be able to control the auto open and lock functions myself. Need the dealer to do it.
5,Great Vehicle,Kurt ,11/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I were looking for a new crossover SUV and it came down to the Ford Explorer and the Toyota Highlander.  We just bought it last weekend.  I chose the Toyota because my previous experiences with their vehicles have been very positive, and I perceived the Toyota to be a better value.  The looks are stunning, it rides like a Lexus, and the build quality is superior to the Ford's.  If you drive her easy, you can easily get 25 mpg city/highway (not bad for a 270 hp, 5000 lb vehicle).  We also needed something that would last us 10 years or more, so I gravitated towards the Toyota.  ","Exterior design, interior design, navigation system, backup camera, digital monitors, car-like ride w/SUV capability, build quality.","JBL stereo could use a little more ooomph; not as nice as my Mercedes Bose system.  Overall though, a great value.  Toyota set the bar high on this one."
5,Worth It,Bigchief ,10/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I only have owned for 2 weeks, but this vehicle has surpassed my expectations.  I researched and tested Acadia and Mazda CX9, however, based on the features and looks of the Highlander, this was my choice. I am hoping the maintenance and cost of ownership of the Toyota reputation is valid with this vehicle. I have received many ""thumbs-up"" gestures from older Highlander drivers. I chose the Sport with a lot of extras. Would have been easier to deside if a greater selection of Highlanders were on the lot, but I am thrilled with the color and vehicle I ordered.","Stow and go was one of this big interior features that sold me.  Love the Bluetooth (sometimes has been a little too difficult to make calls), rear camera, and cockpit design.",Not sure if I will get frustrated with Bluetooth voice recognition or callers saying they can't understand me. Very good design and performance otherwise.
4.625,Love my new 08 Sport!,Peter ,10/22/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"I traded my 2004 Sequoia since I have decided to go a litle more green in my life.  I still need the ability to drive around 2 small children and was not going to get a minivan.  The new Highlander fits the bill perfectly.  Drives like a Camry not a truck, and is so quiet and comfortable.  I got the factory tow hitch and running boards, Option A package.  I will be adding the body side moldings when they get reintroduced with the proper adhesive.  I have all weather floor and cargo mats, door edge guards and a few oil filters being shipped to me.

We got just under 28 mpg on the way back. So far we seem to be averaging 20 mpg around town. Kids love the room and the third row seat. Great ride, quiet and comfortable. We're glad this vehicle came with the back up camera without having to get the nav. system. We looked for a long time and at lots of different cars, this easily was the best car for us.","My wife loves the smart key best, but the second row captains chairs and the third row seat for the kids are great. Auto air and the rear air system truly make for a comfortable cabin.  Back up camera is a nice safety feature for our neighborhood.",A seat memory option would be great.  The DVD system with the screen down severely blocks the rear view.

We traded in our Honda Odyssey, because the kids are getting their own licenses now and we wanted something for mostly us. However, we were reluctant to give up the roominess of the Odyssey. Our Highlander still maintains the feeling of spaciousness, fits the kids comfortably, when needed and just feels good to drive.","The backup camera is a great feature. Easy to see how much back-up room you have in tight parking situations.Also love the 2nd row bucket seats with plenty of leg-room.Toyota has also made the task of putting seats down flat easy, with a quick lever pull. Love the moonroof & the JBL system rocks!","I miss my heated seats, which are available with the leather seat package. Also wish that they had left/right turn signals on the side mirrors."
5,The best of the best,Kyle Ginder ,10/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Excellent vehicle all around. I have the sport model and love the looks of it, and it handles great. Toyota has really outdone themselves w/the highlander. The only negative things I have to say about it is that I don't care for the headlights when switched to brights but dims work great and head rests are just a little to far forward.","V6 3.5 engines shifts smooth, bluetooth, backup camera, sharp turn radius.","Brights arent the best, head rest are too far forward."

I love the extra room our kids now have (compared to 07 Rav4).  The engine is also well suited to this vehicle as it was way too much for the Rav4.  The storage area is also large with 3rd row seats down.  Overall pleased with the purchase and love the car!","Comfortable seats, powerful engine, AWD.","The design team overlooked one detail, making the 3rd row a 50/50 split like the Rav4.

4.5,Excellent for big guys,Sagray ,10/09/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"I've had this for 5 days now, and I took it on a weekend trip already. It's wonderful to drive. Not super duper quiet, but much better than most non-luxury cars.  I searched for an upper-tier vehicle that would fit my 6'4"", 300 lb frame. None of the luxury vehicles fit me, and I almost gave up before I read that Toyota made the Highlander bigger for 2008. All I can say is EUREKA! They did a great job, because it's a great vehicle, and it fits me quite nicely.  Everything seems designed quite well. Since I got all the bells and whistles, I'm still learning my way around but I haven't found anything to really disappoint me. ","I'm a button-pushing gadget fiend, and I love playing with the navigation system! The big 19"" wheels and great suspension give it an excellent ride. And the roomy interior does the trick for me!","The JBL premium audio is nice, but I was expecting a little more. It's a nice car system, but nothing like what I could put together aftermarket."

I knew I wanted a Toyota but didn't like the 4Runner look.  Was going to get the RAV4 until I saw the re-designed Highlander.  I had to have one - love the look!  Not crazy about the black 2-tone interior, but that is a minor thing.  Also, wish the Bluetooth capability was standard.  Not worth the additional $ in the higher end package.

It's the same car as the much more expensive version without the overpriced dvd player, blue tooth and GPS (we have our own for that one time a month we need it). This car is clearly superior in features to the 2008 Honda Pilot which drives like a truck to both me and my wife. It replaced a Honda Odyssey but still has the ability to seat 7 people comfortably (and looks way cooler!). We love it!!","It's so quiet.

I wanted to  try something different and found the 08 Highlander to be that vehicle.  It rides nice and has all the bells and whistles.  I like the push button start and the power rear door.  The rear door is great when shopping, just push the button and the rear hatch opens.  I love the look of the 19 inch wheels also.

The base has the standard features but when you are used to a loaded Toyota you do not realize how many options you are missing until you leave the dealership.  No power lift gate. Takes two men and a small boy to pull it down.  No outside temp gauge.  Manual cloth base seats are not all that comfortable on trips.  No blue tooth, no hitch, though you pay standard for the prep. I guess they drilled some holes in the frame for you. You cannot buy a hitch yet.   No body side molding. I see numerous door dings in the future.  Multiple blind spots.

Ride is great, drives and handles like a Camry more so than a truck/SUV.  Great on gas, a powerful and efficient V6 vs. a gas guzzling V8.  A lot roomier than we thought as we needed a 3rd row, bigger than the new 4Runners with 3rd rows (looks better too).  Very stylish, lots of complements.  In a nutshell - Toyota quality!","Autostick!

Maybe packaging options."

Seat comfort on long trips is an issue. There is much more road noise than I have been used to. Would undercoating possibly diminish the noise factor? I attempted to get tires that might be quieter. Due to the size, the tire store owner could not locate options for me with three of the main manufacturers and he did not pursue it any further. Other than that I love not needing to fumble in my purse for the keys all the time.  That's great when your hands are full.",I love the smart key option for entry and exit with the quick lock on the outside. I like how the dash is arranged - reasonably easy to use without taking your eyes off the road to an uncomfortable extent.,"A little more plush seats for long trips.

I'm over 6 foot and have plenty of room in 1st and 2nd rows. Suspension and steering could be slightly more firm, however neither is anywhere near as bad as some say.

It came with nav, Bluetooth that connected my cell phone in 2 steps, 4 CD changers that can play MP3 and WMA so you could burn about 130 songs in each CD. It also came with full screen back up camera and a stereo input for iPod or MP3 player.  The ride is very quiet compared to my 2001 4Runner.

4.25,Some Reservations After 300 Miles,paktype ,09/18/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"I took delivery of my silver '08 Highlander Sport with 4wd in August. After three weeks and 300 miles, I have the following, admittedly small, reservations.  1) The steering is too light and doesn't offer enough ""feel"" of the road.  2) The interior uses some cheap-looking and cheap-feeling plastic (probably to keep the Highlander from usurping Lexus buyers).  3) Handling is surprisingly squirrely on the highway (a lot of little course corrections needed) despite the 4wd. This could be a problem inherent with the 19 inch wheels and tires.  4) Driver's side power window switches are blocked slightly by inside door pull handle. Not bad, but enough to be annoying.",Toyota reliability; gated shifter; very expensive looking 19 inch wheels; exterior design; rear-view camera and trip computer; tight turning circle for an SUV. ,More steering feel; better interior materials on the dashboard; standard wheel locks to protect wheels from theft.
4.5,"Not perfect, but pretty nice",Rexlion ,09/17/2007,,,5,3,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"This basic AWD model is almost identical in size to our 2000 Merc Mountaineer, but a little wider and way better ride.  Interior fan so much quieter.  Headlights much better illumination.  Not as good looking or as much fun to drive as the Rav4 in my opinion, but we want to tow a 4000 lb travel trailer and the Rav won't quite do it.  This Highlander has plenty of goodies as standard equipment.  And 8"" ground clearance, yet it's easier to get in and out of than the old Mountaineer.  My 5'2"" wife is happy about that.","Cool dash display at night, headlights work great, quiet fan, quiet ride, good acceleration.","Get rid of those ugly hood ridges!  Outer styling not the greatest IMO. Headrest is too close to back of head, distracting to be bumping my head against it while driving but I think some models have an optional adjustable-tilt headrest."

New one is larger, has more power and is quieter, but gets around the same gas mileage so far, which should improve after break-in and start using Mobil 1.  More room for 3rd row passengers.  Some nice added features from previous models, like the 19"" wheels, fully adjustable steering wheel and automatic rear passenger AC.",Rear window opens.  Most wanted safety features are standard now.  Quieter. More power.  Bucket rear seats. Adjustable temp heated seats.,"The standard (non navigator screen) rear view TV is of limited value, tough to see and judge distances; some flickering noticed.  Maybe the larger screen that comes with the GPS may be better.  Roof rack comes with rails, but no crossbars; they're an extra cost option."

However, we worked a deal to get black leather installed.   The dealership did an outstanding job with the leather seats, and the end product is phenomenal.  The black leather on top of the light gray seat base is a perfect complement to the black dashboard with the light gray lower dash.   We recently purchased the 19"" wheels found on the Limited and Sport models off of eBay (lucky lucky) significantly cheaper than we would have paid through the dealer.  It has such a custom feel now. We just love it.  ","New design, interior features are smooth and organized, smooth engine, 19"" wheels,  bench seat in the back easily transforms into captain seats.","The only issue we have is the rear door/hatch.  It is very heavy, especially for a pregnant woman.  I would recommend getting the auto door opener and closer, if possible. Trust us."

5,Exceeds my expectations!!,Bullet ,09/07/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The new Highlander is a must see/must drive vehicle if you are in the market for a new SUV.  While a crossover by design, it can still tow 5,000 lbs.  Yet rides and handles as well as a car. It's a super quiet vehicle and leans to the luxury side of the market.  Feels like you're driving a Lexus.  More gadgetry than you can learn in a week. I've had it a week now and am still learning.  I think the gas mileage is good considering it's an SUV.  I get as good as my old 1996 Isuzu Oasis which was a 4 cyl. and there is no comparison as to power.  This thing really moves! Quality materials and build.  This vehicle is a real winner for Toyota!","I love how the dash is designed. Everything functional is easy to find and easy to use.  I also love the ride and the comfortable seats.  For an SUV with this power, I think the gas mileage is great!",I sat here for five minutes trying to think how I would improve this vehicle and I'm stumped.  So I'll go along with the others and say they should put a more attractive headliner even though I don't care.  Looks fine to me.

Very comfortable, very spacious.  Very happy!  We were thinking Rav4, Pilot, Outlook, and Highlander and it was a no brainer after a test drive.  Limited rode nice, but the Sport is much more controlled, less floaty.  Make sure you test drive both before you buy!

I was planning to buy a full size SUV but after driving the Highlander, I felt it was the better car for me.  So far I have no complaints.  The car runs flawlessly and rides very comfortably.  I am particularly impressed with the mileage.  I am getting between 19 and 21 mpg.  I drive a combination of city and hwy.  My trips usually exceed 10 miles.  This car is especially quiet, I hate a noisy car!!  This factor along with Toyota quality and reliability played heavily in my purchasing decision.

The roomy interior, the versatility of the stow-n-go center seat/console, the flip down third row when we need it and the large cargo area in the back when we don't. It has the rear back-up cam which is very cool, the built-in antenna in the windshield  and the pop-up rear window. We test drove the 2007 and this 2008 is so much bigger, inside and out.

We purchased one shortly afterward.  Very nice turning radius. The engine has significant power for only being a V-6.  The interior of the Limited is very nice.
