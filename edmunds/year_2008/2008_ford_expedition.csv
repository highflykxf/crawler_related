1,"2nd engine going with less than 90,000 miles",Patrick ,12/14/2015,1,1,4,,,1,1,1,4,,,"Bought our 2008 limited Expedition in 2011 with 36,000 miles.  First engine blew up at 40,000 miles.  I will give our dealer and Ford a lot of credit as they replaced it free of cost to us with a supposed 100,000 mile warranty on the new motor.  Well come to find out, our ""new"" motor was actually a rebuilt one.  Who knows how many miles are actually one it.  And now with our Expedition just coming up on 87.000 miles (only 47,000 on the ""new"" motor) we are having serious issue.  Had it in to the dealer a couple of weeks ago and the replaced coils, plugs, fuel filters, etc... saying that they took all of that off the old motor and put on the new one so it was simply time to replace.  Now a couple of weeks later wife notices check engine light on and takes it back to the dealer.  Now it is all the sensors on the engine going out.  Dealer wants another $1000 to fix that stating its not covered under the warranty on the ""new"" motor because they are parts you put on the engine.  Now keep in mind this dealership has done all recommended regular maintenance like clockwork because i didn't want them to ever have any excuse not to cover the warranty.  A lot of good that seems to have done.  I also have to mention that at this point i have replace the air compressor for the air ride not once but twice at about $1200 each time.  Cant' forget the driver side window and passenger side too, at about $500 each.  Have always been a Ford guy but this is getting crazy.  I have the same paint issue too that have seen multiple complaints about too.  Bubbling paint on the front of the hood and tailgate.  We bought the expedition because of all the great reviews we saw and the amount of miles people were getting out of them but apparently we didn't look hard enough.  Now that i have done a lot of research specifically about engine issue I see it is a very common problem that these motors blow on people.  Ours went earlier than most, but still far to common of a problem for Ford to ignore.  Wish I could recommend this vehicle to others but if i had to do it again I would run from it.",,
4.125,2008 Expedition,adams_w ,06/07/2013,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,5,4,Bought this used Expy with 48K. Driven additional 50K in the last 16 mos. Beautiful! Quiet interstate cruiser that is safe and fun to drive. One of few vehicles you can drive 500-600 miles in a day and still feel decent. Gas mileage @ 65 mph has been a consistent 20-21. Highway cruising range is great at 500 miles. ,"Favorite features is... safety. And...leg room. At 6'4"" I can stretch out my long legs and not feel cramped. Thank you, Ford! Appreciate the quiet ""Beep"" sensor when backing and getting close to an object. And...love the power third row folding seat. Push a button -done! And when not needed - they disappear. Leather seats are very supportive. Love the layout design in the central console. ",Had trouble with the 6-changer CD player. Not good. Plays only when it's in the mood. 
4,Better real world MPG than our Tahoe,rustinn ,04/07/2012,,,4,4,2,5,,4,5,5,3,"We own an '07 Tahoe alongside an '08 Expedition. I don't know how the EPA got their MPG figures but in the similar driving, I am getting slightly better MPG in the Expedition and I believe it is because of its 6 speed transmission as opposed to the Tahoe's abysmal 4 speed. The Tahoe has better off the line torque but its 4 speed logic makes downshifting a ""forget about it"" scenario. The transmission in this car is beautiful, upshifts/downshifts at precisely the right times and it doesn't quarrel with the driver. This car rockets along at higher speeds but lacks the punch of the Tahoe at low speeds. Interior noise is pin-drop quite at low speeds but picks up a lot of wind noise on the highway","Buttery smooth ""crown-vic"" like handling makes road imperfections go unnoticed, cooled seats, the perforated leather on the leather seats, good light offroad capability, although visibility is excellent in this car, the backup camera is a very welcome option","Brakes are less reliable than that of the Tahoe's but are easier to modulate, low end torque, steering feel could be better, seats aren't as comfortable as the Tahoe's, wind noise needs better insulation on the highway, mediocre paint job, door sills are too heavy and don't have that holding feature that is executed perfectly on the Tahoe"

Nice ride, good mileage for a big SUV, no major mechanical problems the past 3 years. Interior comfort is just O.K., the seats were a bit firm at first and took a while to break in (not like the ""lazyboys"" that go into Suburbans and Yukons). The one niggling complaint I've had with this vehicle is the power windows.  All the window motors turned anemic just months after my purchase.  No amount of shop adjustments/solutions ever helped this condition.  Hit the window buttons and take a nap until they fully open/close. They also are prone to sticking in cold weather.","Steering continues to stay tight, even after 3 years; nice highway ride. I like having the shifter on the console.  The 3rd row power fold-down is clever, although it takes away some ""headroom"" inches for stowage back there.","My Expedition gets worked hard every day; Ford needs to beef it up (or add packages) to take more of a pounding - not everyone who buys this vehicle is a soccer mom driving 50 lb. urchans around town.

Overall Average 16-18 mpg.  DVD keeps the twins entertained, while the NAV gets us where we go. No complaints, no regrets.

We have almost 50k on the truck now and I have to say it's one of my favorite cars I've ever owned.  For the most part there have been no problems until recently.  If you know Ford - you know they have electrical issues.  My GPS system broke, but I had the extended warranty so it cost me $100 deductible.  Also had problems with the gears on the windows (they would move up/down really slow or not at all in extreme heat/cold.  Overall though it's been an amazing truck and when compared to the Tahoe it was an easy decision.  Especially with the auto fold flat seats in the 3rd row.  I would highly recommend this truck.","GPS, Rear DVD.  Auto running boards are nice, but gotta warn people who aren't aware they're coming.  Incredibly comfortable seats.  Went with the captains chairs in the back to allow for a bit more room for road trips, if you travel a lot it's much easier to put items in between the captains seats",Ford needs to fix their electrical issues.

After doing price comparisons, and vehicle qualities, I went with Ford. What really sold me was the flat folding rear seats, the amount of room in the rear seats for adults, heated and cooled front seats, along with the wood trim, plus the unimaginable smooth ride, for a large SUV. Having a backup camera with back up sensors is a big sell also. I got lucky and found a King Ranch model in my area. Everyone who has seen my SUV, loves it and wants one of their own. Don't have a problem with its size, as I drove buses and motorcoaches. I love my little luxury coach.....

I've owned 3 different Japanese vehicles in the past, but given this massive Ford's decent-for- class mileage and quality, I sure am glad I resisted the inclination to get a Sequoia and pocketed the extra $9,000. This SUV is the hidden gem in the field. Just compare its third row to the equivalent regular wheelbase GM, Rover, Infiniti, and Toyota, and you'll know that Ford's engineers have slaved as hard as their accountants to produce untouchable SUV value.

This review almost makes it sound like I work for Ford! I don't.","The ride, general comfort, and the sound system. Almost forgot the power rear seats and liftgate, great for when you have your hands full.",Can't think of any right now. 
4.125,"So far, so good",Kayemtee ,03/20/2008,,,4,5,4,5,,4,5,3,3,"In the first month of ownership, I have no regrets about my choice. I traded a 2003 Explorer with many problems at 55k miles so I am leasing this one. I enjoy the room (at 6 feet 2, I have lots of head room and extra seat travel both of which the Explorer lacked. The ride quality is excellent, much better than the 2008 Toyota Sequoia I tested, particulary over less than perfect pavement. Power is adaquate although I haven't towed my boat yet. Turning circle is fine for such a large truck. Gas usage is not terrible given it's  5625 lb. As per the trip computer, I an averaging 15.2 on mostly highway compared to 16 on the Explorer. 6 speed transmission very smooth and low revving.",Power rear liftgate very convenient at the supermarket. Rear view camera in the mirror is great (no need to order expensive navigation system in order to get rear camera unlike competitors). Heated and cooled seats work well. Sirius radio reasonably priced option. Oil and volt gauges.,Interior looks cheap in many places; lots of hard plastic.  Shortage of interior storage compartments in rear (where do I keep my trailer hitch?)  Dash instruments look like they come from a '62 Mercury. Toyota dash is much nicer.
5,2008 Ford Exp Eddie Bauer,Guitar Kev ,03/15/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I gave my Expedition ""10"" scores throughout for a reason; For a large SUV, one cannot expect to get 25 MPG. I drive the posted speed limit at all times and my average up till now, (only 2100 miles) is 15.6. Considering that I came back to an Expedition from a Honda Pilot, I am thrilled with the gas mileage. Comparing my Pilot which averaged around 19 MPG, I didn't give up that much gas mileage, given the much larger vehicle that the Expedition is. The comfort and ride spells luxury in my book. So far no problems and the dealer is the best I've ever dealt with.","Heated and cooled leather seats, theater lighting, climate control system, smooth ride.","My only minor nitpick is that the 6 speed tranny does get a bit ""busy"" in hilly terrain. I have the 3.31 rear end. But, had I opted for the 3.7, I'm sure I'd have given up some economy."
4.75,First Ford,John H. ,01/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,This is my first Ford and so far I like it.  Out of all other large SUV's this one is best bang for the buck in my opionion.  Nice design both inside and out.  Lost of room!,Cooled seats...very cool.  NAV system is awesome and very easy to use.  Figured it out by messing with it for about 15 mins.  Interior design is very nice and cozy...tons of room for the family.  Extremely soft ride and very quiet.  Power lift gate comes in handy. Power fold mirrors.,I was disappointed to find out the rims are crome clad wheels...they look nice but they are plastic covers.  Should have the option for remote start. Door panels are made of cheap plastic. Acceleration is satisfactory. Ford should attempt to improve on fuel acconomy.
4.375,"Style, Safety  and Quality Great ",Jeff ,01/07/2008,,,3,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"Our Limited looks great, gets a lot of compliments and is a very nice vehicle to drive. Big vehicle and you feel very safe but pay in gas mileage, but nothing unexpected, avg for us is about 14.7.  Major disappointment has been useable storage space.  The front of the vehicle is largely taken up by the center console. There is just one big hole in the armrest and little else. If two people up front you will have stuff tucked under your legs, on your lap etc. especially if you have kids.  Back seats not much better, seem like always stuff all over the floor boards. Coming from a T&C minivan the space has been a real issue. Power could be slightly better, but did not expect to drag race!","DVD system, rear view camera, large sunroof, easy to drive, great stereo, power liftgate, heated and cooled seats, great styling with 20"" wheels, power folding third row","Nav system is not all that intuitive, our $300 portable Garmin is much easier to use. Need more usable interior storage space.  Should have way more upfront for a vehicle this size. More power and better gas mileage a pretty standard request!"
4.875,Amazing Vehicle/SUV,Kacy Schloop ,11/28/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Amazing handling and comfort for a large SUV. The design is very sharp with the 20"" wheels. Get comments on it regularly. The navigation system, stereo, etc are top of the line. Nice twist on the back up camera.  All that while hauling three kids in car seats, 2 dogs and a 5,000lb boat. Very nice looking, functional and solid vehicle. ","Navigation system, power liftgate, power third row fold down seats, back- up camera and sound system.  ","It is a large SUV, so better gas mileage would nice.  "
4.875,Love it!,socalstone ,11/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Have liked this new design since it came out for 07. Finally got one early this month. Wish I had done it sooner. 20"" wheels really set it off- perfect size in proportion to the size of the vehicle. Truck feels very solid & tight. Very quiet inside. Very comfortable. Heated seats warm lower back in addition to seat bottom. (that was a pleasant surprise!) Brakes feel very strong. Engine feels strong as well. My wife drives it more than me. She absolutely loves it.  I'm looking forward to trying out the air conditioned seats next summer as well as the 9200lb towing capacity. -Have a 5200lb boat (8000lbs with trailer, fuel and gear) My old Tahoe was only rated to pull 7000lbs. ","Fold flat 3rd row seat, reverse camera, exterior design. heated/cooled seats, Rear DVD, satellite radio, keyless entry. 20"" wheels & Pirelli tires.","None... other than gas mileage, but what can you expect with a full size truck?  Actually, on a recent road trip we got 17mpg on the highway. That is better than my Tahoe, which as I recall got about 15 or so."
4.875,Our 3rd generation Expedition!,fordguy ,11/22/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This Expy makes our 3rd. A gold XLT witht he 4.6 V-8, an black XLT with the bigger V* and this white 08 XLT. The progression and evolution of these vehicles is remarkable. The 08 is a s good as anything from any other manufacturer, including GMC, Chevy, Toyota, Nissan and Honda...and in fact better than them in many ways. The quality is great, features for the price remarkable, ride and handling not at all what we expected, very smooth, quiet and controlled. The V8, as typical for the Expedition, does not feel as peppy as the sound and horsepower would indicate, but it's a trailer pulling mule!  Big and barn like inside, comfortable seats, leg room and head room great. Love it!","All of the above, and the price on sale was great, $26,999.00 on ad pretty well equipped. Great stereo CD system, lots of amenites and features.","Come on Ford, take a clue from GM on the engine. Needs to perform better, less drama under acceleration and better fuel mileage. Transmission is wonderful, the engine needs to catch up! "
4.625,XLT 4WD,Alan ,11/15/2007,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"Everything you'd expect in an American full sized SUV.  Solidly built, exceptional comfort, surprisingly nimble (especially in parking lots)all at a decent price. Our first choice would have been a Mercedes GL 450 at $64,000. Almost $30,000 more than the XLT, and the XLT was far more comfortable. The only problem with the XLT is the poor MPG.  13.5 MPG for an average is not unexpected, just getting to be expensive.  19 MPG on the highway is OK, but not good enough. With that said, overall our family loves this truck.  Comfort, safety and quality sums it up.","Comfort, and solid build quality, easy to park. Good price.  Assembled in Michigan. ",Ford has got to put more into improving fuel economy.
4.625,Going in eyes wide open,wvgasguy ,11/10/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,4,"Seriously, how do you rate this as ""fun to drive""? It's as big as a boat. That's why I bought it though. It gets lously mileage. I knew that up front. You'll not get more than 14 with the 4wd. But no other SUV (other than the new Sequoia) will have as much leg room and be as comfortable. The specs on the Tahoe look comparable but if you actually sit in one you'll wonder what kind of ruler they were using. The 3rd row is useless and the 2nd row is still tight. I wanted room. Besides the Expo has absolutely the most non-truck looking interior of them all (at least in the under $50K line) I tried not to go back but saw no compariable options out there for ride, comfort and usability.",The Ford Leasing sold me! I can lease it and later buy it for less than buying it now due to the low lease rate. If gas prices are high I can walk away from it in two years. GM's rate was not comparable. Air Conditioned seats rule. Flat folding 3rd row makes this the king of large SUV's!,Fuel economy. There has to be a way to make this thing get at least 18mpg on a long highway trip. I'm leasing in hopes that 2 years down the road there is a diesel version or even a hybrid model.
5,Best Vehicle Yet,Burt ,10/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is by far the best vehicle I have owned to date.  While it is a large SUV, it handles and rides more like a car and the interior is as luxurious as my wife's Lexus.  I've had so many comments already on the styling and the interior.","The Chapparal leather, power lift gate, power running boards, back up camera, and the climate controlled seats set this car apart from any other I have had or any other I have seen on the market.  I also love the space in the back when all the seats are laid down.","While 300 horses is probably enough, a little more would make this the perfect vehicle."
5,Excursion Limited,Diran K. ,10/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is a hot truck. It is really quiet inside compare to the last Expedition I traded in. Handles really well, great stereo, good power. I have received a lot of compliments already on the interior.","Back up camera displays images on the rear view mirror, Very cool. All gauges and functions are with in reach and easy to use. Love the running boards.",
5,The Best Expedition Ever,Iqbaldhillon2 ,09/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just recently bought a brand new '08 Expedition Eddie Bauer. It is my best SUV so far. The back-up camera and GPS systems are excellent. The new 6-speed tranny is also smooth and powerful. I used to own a '05 Expedition and was about to buy a Tahoe until I noticed that the Tahoe had absolutely no legroom, and used a '90s 4-speed tranny. Then I saw the new Expedition and fell in love with it. Not only does the new Expedition feel good, but it's fun to drive. The fuel economy has also improved from the previous generation. It is my new favorite in my driveway.","The 6-speed automatic transmission, backup camera, GPS navigation system, and auto-lift tailgate.","None, this is what I call the perfect Full-size SUV."
5,First time Ford SUV owner,Scott ,08/31/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We switched after two Tahoe's and 2 Pathfinders.  The final decision after reviewing MB GL, Chevy Tahoe, GMC, Range Rover Sport, Nissan and Infiniti, and Toyota was this loaded Expedition Limited.  The big factors:  Design, navigation nystem, folding 3rd row, interior finish, tow package,...  At a lower price than anything the competition could offer.  My wife is the primary driver and loves it already!","Navigation, GPS, interior finish",None yet - watch for future post.  I gave it a nine for fuel economy because we always hope for more.  We will see after a winter of driving.
5,Are you serious?,1oFaKiND ,08/29/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,Over the last couple of months I've had so much fun offroading the Expedition taking it to long distance trips it cannot get any more comfortable it already is it feels as if they used Nasa cushion in the chairs any ways i'm happy with my Expedition and I'm planning to keep it for a long time. I'm also going to keep the cheap black plastic :) ,I really like how they made the Expedition bulkier which gave me more room to fit alot of things in,I think the Ford expedition would be better if you would add about 40-50 more hp
