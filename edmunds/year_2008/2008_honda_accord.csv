I've tried so hard to love it but I will never buy another. I'm the second owner and driven it to 108,000 miles and will drive another 100K. Problems are: oil consumption, power steering pump noise, oil consumption, VTC actuator noise (severe) and did I mentioned oil consumption. I'm mad tired of the oil consumption. Have to refill every 500 miles even though I have cleaned throttle body, changed spark plugs, air filter, PCV valve...I've tried Lucas, STP, full synthetic, semi synthetic, nothing works (except Lucas helped but that thing is not oil, it's freaking grease and don't use it)! Tired of oil consumption! Call Honda headquarters, called local Honda...nothing will work.",,

I think that's a lot of oil for every oil change. I've called a several Honda dealerships about my concern but since I'm out of the warranty extension by 400 miles and by 3 months I'm not elegible for the repair with the piston the rings. Now I'm stuck so with a great car that burns a lot of oil and will end up paying more money to fix or replace the engine then what the car is worth. I definitely don't recommend the 4 cylinder 2008 Honda Accord unless your willing  to carry at least 2 quarts of oil in your vehicle like I do.

I bought it with 83000 miles and we just hit 120000 and it runs as strong as a new accord.  I plan to drive this car to the ground and I think it might stop running when it hits 500000 miles.

I blast the radio every time I drive it.- the car nudges when acceleration like the car not getting enough gas. Does have good power over 3500 rpm.  - the seats are hard. Back hurts after long drives. Feels like you are sitting on a blanket with a piece of plywood on top. I thought when I brought it the seats would break in over time. Not this car. The seats are as hard as the day I got it. Now has 80000 miles on it. - chrome paint on grill is flaking off. Paint on hood started comming off. Looked like it was bubbling underneath the paint then every time I washed it I loosed paint. Has the hood painted at 50000 miles. I still can't get over the hood getting painted. I mean every time you get in the car and look out the window you always see the hood. - overall I still own the car. I wish I sold it to a couple who wanted it more than I did. I've had Hondas in the past. But this one has the be the least one I like. The others were a 1986 crx. That was the most fun Honda I ever drove. It was fast good on gas everything. Next was a 1996 accord. It ran and drive fine when I sold it. Nothing went wrong with it.  All said and done. For new honda owners test driving a car does not tell you everything. I know a lot of cars have the good things and the bad things about them. I brought my honda because at the time were the best selling cars. It looked cool sporty and in my price range.

I replaced the rear brakes twice during the first 30,000 miles of ownership.  The front brakes are the original brakes (hard to believe).  The rear brakes have not been replaced since the redesign (70,000 miles on the rear pads).  The only other problems I've had are the sway bar bushings and the SRS module.  The SRS module was replaced by the dealer free of charge even though the car had over 100,000 miles (Thank you Fisher Honda, Harry Snyder is the best service representative I have ever encountered).  The car has never burned a drop of oil and handles all elements well here in Colorado with Nokian WRG3 tires.  It's been a very comfortable car overall, however the road noise is high compared to other vehicles in it's class.  In fact, my only significant complaint is the road noise.  I've considered replacing it, but it just drives too well to replace.  It drives almost the same as when I drove it off the lot, I'll probably keep it 2-3 more years as long as it remains trouble free.  Just a great car.",,
1,Honda reliability reputation-A thing of the past,Jim ,11/14/2015,1,3,1,,,1,3,4,3,,,"I bought this car brand new and had problems shortly after with fit and finish - the carpet would continually pull up on the passenger size. The dealer failed 3 times to re-attach it and after a stern talking to, agreed to replace the carpet with one that fit. In the meantime, the dealer would perform unnecessary maintenance at their convenience until I gave the service manager an F-bomb laden speech about who gets to decide what gets done to my car on my money (they threw out my 15$ old filter and mobile 1 synthetic change that was less than a month old to replace it with shop-quality replacements that time).I had the usual problems with brakes and rotor replacements and I thought it was all over.Then I get a notice about oil burning and the 2.4L engine. They extended the warranty in a way that seems to suggest they will try to weasel out of paying out. This is done by limiting mileage and date and specifying a redemption process which is a PIA. I did have to add a quart between changes, but I try to take care of this car as if I would keep it forever - this is why I spend the extra money to get high-quality fluids and filters and yet keep to the mgr's maintenance schedule. I have just sent some used oil out for analysis and if it shows oil burning at 73K miles, I will trade the car in.The transmission went out at 72k and required a full replacement. Since I had no faith in the abilities of the dealership, I had the work done at an independent shop I trust. I inquired about a ""honda good faith"" program and the gentlemen basically tried to hang up on me when I told him I wasn't working with a dealer. I asked him how long a transmission should last and the answer in a nutshell was 5 years/50K miles. This lifetime on a modern car is, quite frankly - unacceptable.I've had 3 Hondas in the past and they were boring and reliable. This one is just boring. So no more Hondas for me. Ever.",,

4.125,Great Car Overall ,chiney_whale ,06/16/2015,,,4,5,4,3,,4,4,4,5,"I purchased my Honda as a more affordable alternative to an Audi A5 and BMW 3 (now 4)Series coupe.  The exterior of this car is sharp (especially in the Belize Blue Pearl). The exterior design has aged very well.  The interior design has aged very well and I find the button layout to be very logical.  I was surprised to see so much hard plastic on the dash at this price range ($30k +), but visually it looks good.  The car has way too much road noise however.  The car has a taunt but comfortable ride, which gives it a sporty premium feel I like.  The engine has tons of power once your hit 3000 rpm, but below that its pretty gutless.  Fuel economy is right in line with EPA estimates.       ","The cylinder deactivation is pretty cool.  The auto V6 can cut off 2 or 3 of its cylinders when cruising to save gas.  An ECO light illuminates whenever its activated; however, it doesn't tell you whether your running on 4 or 3 cylinders.  I love the v6!  Its powerful once you get over 3000 rpm and sounds great.  The car has a spacious trunk and a surprising amount of legroom for rear passengers.  The rear seats fold down (only as one piece) which allows it to be pretty handy for the fun to Home Depot or Lowes.","My reliability on this car hasn't been up to the standards I expected of Honda.  The car has very weak brakes, which causes premature wear and warping of the pads and rotors.  There is a TSB out for this.  Also, my cylinder 3 spark plug needed to be replaced three times in less than 100k miles b/c of a defect in the cylinder deactivation system that causes oil to get on the spark plug.  There is a TSB out for this, which requires the ECU to be re-flashed to change the way the deactivation system works.  Other than reliability, Honda needs to invest in more sound deadening and increase cabin technology (the infotainment graphics are severely dated).  "

Size/Comfort - It is the perfect size car to me, big enough to fit five full size adults, without feeling like a limo.
Features - This car is welled optioned with leather interior, sunroof, upgraded stereo, and still has a manual transmission! The double click and hold feature on the unlock button of the key remote opening all the windows and sunroof is great in the summer. The courtesy light is a great feature at night as well, lighting the interior of the car.
It has to be the best sounding four cylinder on the road.","Transmission - Good gate feel but doesn't like to be rushed between gears. First to second under hard acceleration almost requires a double clutch to get it to shift.
The ultimate sin, the gears are to spread out to keep the engine in its top power band.
Build Quality and Reliability - Hard to believe this car wears a Honda badge.
VTC failed first, then I noticed the car would use a quart of oil every 700 miles.
I had to replace the engine due to a known piston ring issue that Honda would not fix.
Add rattles, hanging trim, and fading switches and my daughter's 2007 Jeep Compass with same size engine has proven to be a much better built car.
I can't believe it."

In November 2013 it was missing when I would stop so I took it to be looked at the local garage. They mentioned that Honda has had a lot of trouble with these V6's & that they don't even suggest buying a Honda anymore when someone asks for a reliable car. They had checked it out & replaced the #3 plug which from the posts on line, this is a common problem. So after getting home I looked online as to the problem with these & find that they start burning oil. This seemed total crazy, a car burning oil before, say 100K? In the old days yes but newer cars?Some had said they were putting","Continuation- a quart of oil in every 1K. So I thought this can't be right so I checked the oil in the Accord. Sure enough it was a quart low 4K after an oil change. Other problems are terrible noise in the interior, steering wheel shaking really bad when braking hard & it went though the first set of brake pads in no time. Favorite feature? GETTING rid of it! The only other thing I liked was XM radio but the stereo you had a hard time hearing over the noises & rattle anyway. ","Honda needs to reengineer the engine if they haven't for the latest model. I believe since it's a variable displacement motor is that #3 cylinder burns the plug out maybe from turning on & off. then fuel continues to go in the cylinder washing the oil off the piston rings which then ruins the rings & sleeve causing oil to pass the rings & burn. The other major defects are the rattles in the car (Many people complain about this). The back deck in the cabin is the worst! The other is brake problems. Mine shook so bad when braking hard you really had to hold on to the wheel.

Be prepared for an additional couple hundred dollars in repairs every few months if you are considering buying. Interior noise is MISERABLE. Road noise is insanely loud as is wind noise.

The brakes had to be totally replaced at 22,000 miles that nobody can explain why this happened.

Certainly a lot bigger than my 2004 but still a nice & sporty driving experience.  The exterior styling was a winner for me.  Overall comfort for me is above average (but I think I have the right body type). Only failing so far is the Rear Brake pads prematurely wearing at 22,000.  Did not expect it!!  So I got them replaced and called Honda to file a compliant. That's why my reliability rating is lower.","The handling and power of the car (4 cylinder) is all there; no need for a V6 with this model.  Visibility is great and sitting is comfortable.

The inside and outside pads should ALWAYS wear evenly (IF ONE PAD IS WEARING TOO FAST SOMETHING IS WRONG) 3) Always had stiff ride and seats.  ,"MP3, interior room, power, handling.",1) More sound insulation. 2) Different wheel/tire options.

There is also a lag on acceleration, likely due to the VEM.  2008 models have many problem areas; rear brake premature wear at 20,000, improperly installed headlights and taillights causing paint chipping around the lights.  Seats are too firm and leather is quite ""hard"" in character and feel.  Lots of room, especially for the driver and passenger.  Radio works great.  Gas mileage not quite as good as advertised.  Quality does not seem to be up to par as previous Hondas.  Resale value for the V6 is unacceptably low.  Rear window should have a rear wiper.","Design, black color, roominess, layout of instrument panel in general, although unnecessarily too many buttons","Should have blue tooth phone without navigation upgrade, NO VEM, engine should be tuned to match stick version, better quality and fit and finish, softer seats with better quality leather, better resale value, better acceleration, sport shifting in automatic mode as even the most basic cars have now"

I change the oil and perform the scheduled maintenance. I find the interior comfortable for short and long trips. My wife does say the vehicle is not as comfortable for long trips as other cars we've owned. A couple of downsides. The headlights aren't as bright as I would like. This should be fixed.

And at the end of a long trip your ears are still buzzing with the sounds of road noise.... Honda designed a beautiful car, too bad the mechanics aren't on par with the design. I have had others before with no such problem. This one is a joke. I am getting rid of this car as soon as I can. Stay away from this one.

The new exterior design and ACE engineering really sold me on the car, as well as the standard features on the EX-L. I needed a smart looking, roomy, reliable family car that still made me enjoy my commute when the kids weren't on board. This car fits the bill. I opted for the EX-L as opposed to the EX-L V6 because at the time of purchase I wasn't sure what the future held for gas prices and a 190hp 4-cylinder seemed more than adequate for me. My only gripes with the car stem around the heated seat switches and the XM Radio.","Very good power w. a decent return on gas, huge trunk, roomy interior, nice list of  standard features including above par stereo w.

The inside is a total different matter. Rattles and noises showed up after a few days and it has been downhill ever since. I am not talking about expected noise levels, I wish! Sounds like the very structure in the inside has so many imperfections that you get a concert of annoying noises. I am losing money for I will change this car very soon.    ","The VCM, perhaps, for it saves gas when engaged. No problems so far. The engine seems sound but will not have this vehicle for much longer to be able to endorse that. The power being better than previous models and that is it.","Rattles, noises that appeared without warning and so far impossible to correct.

Retracted,jt007 ,01/17/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,5,5,"When I bought this car a year ago, I initially wrote a review stating I may have buyer's remorse due to extremely uncomfortable driver's seat.

I have gotten as high as 31 on long trips, no air, driving 79 mph. Besides oil changes and tires, no unexpected problems. Cracked grille was replaced by dealer at no charge. Factory fog lights cracked, were replaced at cost. This car is very reliable, and driving it in Michigan's ""blustery"" winters has been nothing but sheer confidence. Overall driving experience A+. ",Adequate power/mpg of 190HP. Navigation system and stereo are technological marvels. VSA in winter outstanding. Car is big without feeling it.

The heated seat button on the driver side is obstructed by the hand brake and the mode button to change the heating and cooling is at the farthest reach of the control panel.  Additionally, it is puzzling that despite the purchase of an EX-L you need to get a v6 just to get something as simple as a universal garage door opener.

Great acceleration for a 4 cylinder automatic, and excellent gas mileage for a large car, which it is. I am averaging about 28.5 mpg, combo highway and city, and I have a lead foot.","I think Honda could've done a better job on the seats and cushioning.

So far, I am a definite fan, though I feel there areas that can be improved. Fuel economy is excellent on the highway, about 26-28 mph. Combined driving is in the low 20s. The VCM definitely helps the mileage - it was very noticeable when it activated in the beginning, but is barely detectable now, except for the dash indicator. At highway speeds, the interior remains quiet, with little to no wind or road noise. ","Exterior looks on red coupe, ride, handling. Excellent traction and handling in snow. Fuel economy is impressive for a 270 HP vehicle, and I have a heavy foot on the gas.","HID headlamps, sport shift, memory seats, T/S in mirror, detailed trip computer.

However, there are a couple of things that kill it for me 1) terrible driver seat comfort, kills my back 2) lack luster interior design, my Acadia has much better comfort 3) the VCM drives me crazy because the constant change in cylinder use is perceptible enough to be an annoyance. I will be trading this car in for a BMW 3-series in the spring. ","Acceleration, handling, fuel economy, space. ","Needs a better sound system, VCM transition, road noise, media interface/control layout, seat comfort. When a tire gets low the indicator light comes on but does not tell you which tire!

My wife has been mad at me ever since.  The EPA mileage ratings and what the dealer bragged about mileage wise are a joke.  Supposed to be 19/29 for the V6 but it's been more like 17/23.  We now have 15,000 miles and the best that we ever got on a road trip was 24.  The brakes have squeaked from early on and after twice having the dealer tell us they couldn't recreate the sound we gave up.  I've owned 5 Toyotas, 3 Infinitis, and 2 Nissans and I would gladly take any of them back over this car.  There is a great deal of road noise in the cabin and the seats are very low quality.

More room. 2 big suitcases + 3 small ones when taking family from airport (we were 5). I can't even believe it can fit them all. Concerning some issues: road noise. I'm quite sensitive to noise and of course the noise canceling system is helping. Good point: it happens only time to time. The seat is slightly hard.

I found the Accord to handle better than the Camry. I test drove them back to back. I commute 25 miles to work, 90% highway, and average 24 to 27mpg depending how I drive. I recently drove 300 miles one way with my wife and 2 kids. The trunk was packed full of luggage. The cruise was set at 70 mph and got 31.3 mpg. I did not do as well on the way back because of Wisconsin cold weather and wind, but averaged 28 mpg over 600 miles including 50 miles driving around Milwaukee. The VCM works best with no hills, and I find it to be nearly seamless.","I like the pass-through from the back seat into the trunk for hauling ski's. I find the instrument panel has nice big buttons and is very intuitive. The steering just feels great, and the visibility looking out is good. The VCM cruises great with no hills.","I would have liked better mpg as I have only been able to do better than 29 mpg once, however I'm at 8000 miles and hope the mileage gets better.

No shiftronic/manumatic mode. This is a nice feature for sporty driving and saving wear and tear on your brakes, Honda does not offer it on the 08 Accord. I had a 2007 Altima V6 for a few months and it was faster, more fun to drive and smoother than the Accord. 3.) no cargo nets in the trunk? 4.)

The test drive was great and I loved the car until I drove it out of town (trip lasted 2 hours) and developed back pain.  Thought I was just getting old but it never improved and I was amazed to see all the other drivers who had the same problem.  I've already been through 2 set of wiper blades after 6 months and had the weatherstripping around the back doors replaced once.  And my headlights blink too!

This car rattles on the dash, passenger side, and rear deck.  I brought this back to the dealer twice, but they couldn't help me.  Honda of America is a big letdown on this one.  I had to drive around with the glove box open to stop the squeaking since it was sitting in wrong.  After the dealer couldn't fix things, I decided to fix it myself by breaking the weld on the latch, moving it then re-welding it myself.

The v6 is smooth and unlike some articles I have seen about the V6 with variable displacement technology I have not experienced any surging.  Engine is most smooth.  In this weak economy you should be able to buy an Accord for no more than dealer invoice.  That is exactly what I paid for my 2008 in Dec 2007.

Has lots of features, is comfortable, everything works.  The downside:  Although the engine is quiet, there are quite noticeable surges from the transmission even with cruise control on. The surges are very noticeable also in heavy stop and go traffic. My old Buicks had far smoother shifts at far higher mileage.  Bumpy roads have too much of an effect on the steering and braking.  I am surprised they would design the exterior so that rain always comes in the windows unless they are completely shut.  Sometimes I need to activate the remote more than once to open the doors.",,I would like to see a minor design change in the steering wheel radio controls.

I do have to agree with other reviews in several areas, excessive road noise and the VCM is very noticeable. If I could turn off the VCM I would and sacrifice the 1 mpg. Come on Honda...would installing a little insulation for the road noise hurt your bottom line that much. ",New front end styling and overall size increase. ,Honda needs to come out with a fix for the VCM. It needs improvement. Provide more adjustment for the front seat head rest so it is not so intrusive. Restyle the rear end. It looks too much like a cheap old Saturn. Gas mileage should be better. I got better mileage with 2001 Bonneville 3.8 V6.

Took two hours trip to the mountain. This car has two problems. Has horrible road noise coming into the car and headlights is NOT bright enough. I don't recommend this car for the price. Nissan Altima is better car.,Aux input for iPod & audio on Steering wheel.,Design and road noise and oil filter location. Why put under exhaust system? Look at Toyota Camry oil filter location.

It has attention grabbing styling from most angles and is yet still a fairly modest car! The front driver seat's lumbar support seemed very uncomfortable at first.   The dashboard angles out to much at the perimeter and ""invites"" you to bump your leg or knee when entering or exiting in a trade off between style and practicality. Perhaps even more annoying is the side windows curve inward too much in accommodating a narrower roof line resulting rain pouring into the vehicle unless are windows virtually shut.         ",Powerful 4 cylinder which gets excellent mileage for a spacious family economy car with decent curb weight for safety,"Improve audio system speakers, use more sound insulation including lining trunk. Make roof line wider so rain does not pour into passenger department. Redesign dashboard so legs and knees don't get whacked upon entry and exit.

My car gives me 450 km with full tank (70 liters). Almost half the mileage as compared to advertisement. I have 2000 Toyota sienna, with 67 liters of fuel it goes more than 500 km. Bigger size, big engine and better fuel efficient than brand new 2008 Honda Accord ex-l (2.4l). I realize that I made a mistake, I should have bought the Toyota Camry instead.",,

As the weeks passed the noise became louder. Took it to get serviced and they replace the starter. Two days after picking up the vehicle from being serviced the same noise started to occur again. It's back at the shop and waiting to see what happens next. It may just be bad luck. Another issue I have is the acceleration. There is a 1 sec delay when accelerating. If your trying to move on the highway give yourself some time. The 4 cycl is sufficient but I'm sure a 6 cycl would provide better acceleration response. ,"The body style provides a flare except for the rear. The rear looks like a Hyundai.

The blinking headlights at night are extremely dangerous.  It causes my eyes to get out of focus for a moment and get strained. It happens around every 20 seconds.  It brings on my migraines because the lights flash so frequently.  Many times people have flashed their brights on me because they think I'm flashing mine at them.

Bad Mistake!,I have heard the blinking headlights is common for this vehicle. Headlights need to be fixed-Dangerous!!! There should be a recall on these vehicles to make them safe.

4,My First Accord,Geoff ,09/10/2008,,,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,"This is my first Accord. I chose it over the Civic. I prefer a car with 4 wheel disc brakes and after dressing up the Civic the price was very close to the Accord LX. I am 6'4"" in height and I fit better in the Accord.  The car drives well. Highway I am getting 35 mpg. City mileage is at 25 mpg.  The paint is good quality. I always hand wax a new car the day I get it to look for flaws or scratches and found the finish to be fine.  It drives very well and has a solid feel on the road at freeway speeds.  I wanted an inexpensive car with good mileage, and strong resale. This car meets my expectations.",4 cylinder engine provides enough power to do the job. Smooth shifting transmission. Leg room and head room is great. Quite and solid. For a 20K car it is excellent value.,Headrests need to tilt. Engine surges 200-300 rpm. I am riding the brakes and turning the steering wheel to park the car in a tight space.

The interior quality is OK, my 1999 Accord EX had a better comfort level on the seats. The dashboard is very well lit, but the stereo system is horrible, it seems to have too much bass when set at zero. Road noise is also bad, my Accord does not have a noise damper on the hood like my old Accord had. Whenever the car is cold, the brakes always make noise, after it has warmed up, it goes away. For some reason, when I use the  windshield defroster, I hear the Air conditioner motor on (Don't think that's normal at all). As with other threads I've read, yes, the Accord should come with a semi auto and projector lights.","Well proportioned big buttons on the dash, smooth 5-speed auto, roomy and a high ceiling.

I did my homework and test drove many cars including the Nissan Altima 2.5S and Toyota Camry SE and LE. First off the paint finish on the silver Accord was by far the best. The interior design was much nicer. The Altima had the best transmission and extras like intelligent key but the dashboard was ugly and the paint seemed thin and had bigger blind spots. The Camry was a close second but I really liked the Accord's look better I got the Accord for $600 under invoice with the help of edmunds.com.

The ride is somewhat rough and very noisy.  My Toyota Tacoma truck is quieter than this Honda when traveling at high speed.

I now have 5,000 miles and the situation is getting worse. You don't notice it until you reach cruising speed between 65-70 MPH.

It has nice styling resembling that of a BMW, with the hofmeister kinked window line, uncurved rear door outline, and bold lines.  It's a comfortable ride and is very high quality.  However, right after I bought it, my brakes were making a rumbling sound/feel, so I took it to the dealer and they installed new rear rotors under warranty.  That just didn't seem right to me for a new car to have such an issue.  Overall it's a great buy for a family or individual who needs the space.  The car is pretty large and bulky, though That's not necessarily a bad thing.","Radio and clock display, A/C controls (A/C is nice and cold), build quality, style, and space","Less road noise, Projector headlamps (at least), and Power passenger seat to accompany the power driver's seat in the LX-P model"

However, I cannot get better than 23 miles to the gallon, even on the highway!  I drive the same way I did in my 2004 Accord that got 33 MPG.  I expect much more from Honda.  The dealership said everything checks out, so it is just the way they built the car.  Too bad.

I currently need new brakes (front & back) which i've never had to get brakes before 30k miles. I do not have a heavy foot for braking. The vibration between 60-70 MPH still exists.  Acceleration seems to be getting weaker and weaker.

Once I test drove this car I was hooked.  For a 4 cylinder car I am surprised at the comfortable and peppy drive.  Recently went to Cape Cod and averaged 34mpg.  Overall, I've been averaging about 25 mpg.  For the money, I do not think you can find a better value.  The nav system is great.  Also test drove the Altima.  It was a tough decision, but the Accord is a better looking car and slightly bigger. ","Looks, fun to drive and nav system.",Front seats take a while to get used to.

I don't really feel the VCM kicking in for the most part, so I really don't mind it.  Gas mileage has been a bit disappointing, but it has been improving.  I've averaged about 23.5 mpg, but was expecting much better with the VCM technology.  Ride and handling are great.  I'm still getting use to the ""bigness"" of this vehicle as I still sometimes feel like it is just too big for a coupe.

Traded in my 99 Mustang GT convertible as I changed jobs and needed a more practical commuter car.  This a good choice if (like me) you need an affordable and comfortable commuting vehicle but hate the idea of a boring boxy sedan.  The Accord Coupe is stylish and sporty.

2.75,2008 Honda Accord,Douglas ,08/17/2008,,,5,5,1,2,,2,3,2,2,"The 2008 Honda Accord V6 is one of the most annoying cars to drive between the vibration in the steering at speeds above 50 mph and the engine constantly changing the number of cylinders that are firing.  In 3 cylinder mode it feels and sounds as if the engine is misfiring.  The gas tank sloshes if the tank is above 3/4 full (the baffles do not extend to the top of the inside of the tank to prevent the gas from sloshing around).  The XM satellite radio frequently loses signal as you drive down the road.  Round noise prevents the radio from being heard well on the highway.  If you stop and then turn going uphill, the transmission down shifts violently throwing everyone in the car.  ",Interior and exterior design is great.  ,Fix the engine and the vibration in the steering.  Could use a little more padding in the front seats.

I enjoy driving the car each and every day (even to work).  The 4 cylinder engine is just right for quick acceleration and highway cruising.  I get 25 MPG in mixed driving and 31 MPG on the highway.  The ownership experience has been excellent.  Dealer service is done with a smile.,"The smooth 5-speed manual keeps me connected with the car. XM radio is great for adults and teenage sons.

5,Overall a big plus with a few nits,Ed C. ,08/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Reading the reviews has me puzzled; either people love the car or hate it. Honda always made cars that were more sporty than American cars and Camry. Had a 1994 Honda Accord with almost 120,000 miles on it and will miss it. Overall the car is great: more room, more power, just as sporty as always (firm seats/ride). ","1) good compromise of firm ride and comfort (bias to sporty of course). 2) 190 HP 3) interior space 4) mileage is good, got 18 MPG (mostly city).",1) Headlights dim when A/C cycles on. From the blogs I have read its probably a too small battery (too few amp/hr) to carry the load. This is only on the 4cyl. 2) It is a noisy car due to fat tires and a free flow exhaust.

4.875,Gas Complaints?,jillybilly ,08/11/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Lots of the reviews are complaining about the MPG - it states clearly at Honda that the 4 cyl only gets 2 MPG better than the 6cyl, which is why I went with the 6cyl. If I need some power, I want it available. If you want 40 MPG, buy a little tin-can eco compact car (which = death in an accident). It's not a Chevy Tahoe, it's an accord! The MPG for this type of vehicle is great, so lets just get real people. I just bought this car, only 200 miles on it, so i haven't settled in enough to have a great review on it as far as ride quality. I've been a BMW driver for the past 10 yrs, and I like feeling stuck to the ground, this car feels very sturdy and weighted, which I like.

I doubted that the 4 cylinder would be enough power, but I test drove it and it's quick. It's no 8 cylinder GT, but it also gets double the gas mileage and so far, no problems. The major factor in my decision was that it's also recommended in Consumer Reports. I didn't want another pile of car crap that was going to give me issues, and Honda has an excellent reputation.

The headlights and taillights flicker every 30 or so seconds when the A/C kicks in at all speeds. Not only is this very annoying but also dangerous due possible road rage from drivers thinking you are flashing them or from a trucker passing you thinking that it's clear by the flicker from the headlights not to mention problems associated with the taillights flickering.

Which is about 5 thousand less for a comparable new Passat. The cabin of the Honda is roomy for two adults and three kids. The seats are comfortable, and there is ample leg room in the front and rear. I also dig the lumbar support on the drivers seat. The ride quality is smooth and quiet.

Although the Altima has the Accord beat on styling, the Accord is the better value and will hold it's value throughout the years better than the Altima.  The Camry seemed a little too much like an old lady's car!  I love almost everything about this car other than the fuel economy.  I was expecting better than 25 MPG.

A big disappointment was that the brake rotors were warped with only 125 miles on it.  The dealer turned the rotors and all is OK now, but it makes me wonder if Honda's quality is slipping.  These are my thoughts: Pros: Fun to drive, fairly roomy, looks good, gas mileage is OK (28 MPG combined), but not as good as Honda advertises. Cons: Most uncomfortable seats in any vehicle I have ever owned.  Even though the seat is powered, it will not adjust low enough in the front to keep pressure off the back of my thighs.

Haven't taken a road trip yet, but am pretty sure it would be even better on the highway. The VCM is obviously working. It is very comfortable, easy to drive and park. LOADS of trunk space, too. Plenty of room for backseat passengers, as well. I have owned 3 other Accords before this one and this is my fav, by far. Only 2 things could make it better; memory seats and a smoother shifting transmission. I can really feel it shift gears and wasn't expecting that. Not horrible, just takes a little getting used to. ","Great fuel mileage and love the XM radio. I picked this one because I could get it in White Diamond Pearl. It is a gorgeous paint color. Dealer added fine pin strips, really catches people's eyes. Also like the ECO light that will come on to let you know when it is getting the best fuel economy. ","Would really have liked memory seats.

4.75,Our Latest Accord - Replaced Acura TL,Sundance ,07/03/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"We have been Accord owners since 1982 and ventured outside only once for a 2004 Acura TL.  After 4 years of harsh ride in the TL, we traded for an 08 Accord EXL V6 and are happy.  The nice ride and handling are back, but miss the compact car the Accord once was.  However, the 08 Accord is well designed, handles well for its size and the comfort level is so much better than the TL.  Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable.  We are getting 23 in town and 27 on the road.  Honda missed the boat in not installing Bluetooth unless you spend $2000+ for NAV.  Also, the headlights of the TL, which were HID, were far superior to the halogen's on the Accord. ",Great ride comfort.,Put Bluetooth in the EX models standard

Roomy, handles very well, good acceleration for a 4 cylinder automatic. Not a single problem with it yet, and don't expect to have many either. While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade-off. I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration. This won't be so bad once people trade in their SUVs and start driving less aggressively.

I returned the car to the dealer and all they did was drive the car around the block and tell me there is no rattle. My guess is they don't have a clue on how to go about fixing it.  Also driving over 70 mph produces loud wind noise.

I spend a lot of time with it.  So here it is:  The 2.4L in the EX is the nosiest engine I have ever had. Although it has good power the refinement sucks. I originally thought it was the PS pump but 2 of those later the thing is still whirring and whining. My neighbor has a Ford Fusion 4 and its significantly quieter than this engine. It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater.,Nice fit and finish. Looks more expensive that it is.

But ""whistling noise"" on acceleration (turbo charged sound kind of) too annoying.  I am worry about vacuum leak. So went to dealer 3 times but no one found out its problem. 

Really loud outside noise compare to Camry. And sm trunk.

The '92 was the best car I've owned in 24 years of driving.  I test drove several models from Toyota, Honda, Acura, VW and Nissan. The Accord was the best in my book with the Camry running a close 2nd. We wanted a safe, functional, affordable & reliable family 4-door to haul adults and kids for a variety of activities.  So far we're very satisfied. Safety ratings are very good. Ride, comfort, visibility, braking, steering and acceleration are excellent for a car of its size and price. MPG are decent for this size car.","Visibility is great. Good steering and braking for a mid-large sedan that's not a BMW or Audi. Great ride comfort, solid acceleration for a 4-cylinder (EX). Gas mileage is as advertised. Excellent rear seat room. Several family members, including my wife & I, are 6 ft & taller. Solid controls, audio.",None really.

5,Very impressive car,4262 ,06/17/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I came from a loaded Chevy Tahoe to the Accord.  This is my second Honda and I am impressed by it.  I bought it with splash guards and rear wing spoiler installed.  The first 1/2 tank of gas yielded 25 mpg (city & hwy).  Gas mileage is still getting better though.  Hopefully I'll be able to consistently stay in the high 20's.  It sure beats the 15.5mpg I was getting with my Tahoe.  Build quality is excellent and everything is intuitive.  Sure there are a lot of buttons at first but you learn to focus on what you want to change and it becomes easier with time.  I don't even have to look at them much anymore, I just know which area to go to in order to change functions.  Very happy with it!",Exterior styling:Very sleek and looks so much better than the previous generations that I considered to be vanilla in styling.  Lots of information and toys for the money.  Navigation is fun and the sound system is nice as well.  Good imaging and decent sound quality for a factory system.,"Have an anti-glare screen for the navi screen.  Need cup holders and rear air for the back.  Heated seats for the bottom and back would be nice, that's one of the nice features of the Tahoe.  Cooled seats would be nice as well but then again, it's only a $30K vehicle."

The 3.5 in the Honda is very similar to the 3.0 I had. I loved that engine and it was easy to work on so my choice was easy. So far, I love this engine too although it's different with VCM. Honda says the VCM works seamlessly but my experience is a little different. When it goes to 4 cylinders, you can't feel it. When it goes to 3, you can. When it goes back to 6, you can't feel it unless you're pulling a grade. It's not objectionable and the increase in mpg is worth it (22-23 city, 28-30 hwy). Watch out for a blind spot on the passenger side.","I like the radio because of good but not ""boomey"" bass. The engine compartment is laid out well with room to work. With 268 HP, the acceleration is there when you need or want it. I like the way you can choose gears, it's more intuitive and you know which gear you're in. ",I would have liked more exterior colors to choose from. I like a firm ride but this could be a tad softer. The low profile tires are probably the main reason.

The 2008 model acceleration from standing start is about the same as the 2006. However, the '08 has better high speed acceleration. The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models. We average between 31 and 34 on highway trips with both cars. Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased. The '08 is more comfortable and handles quite a bit better than the very good experience we had with the '06's. All three of these recent Accords have been totally satisfactory cars.",The crisp handling of this car is a notable first impression and it continues as we have driven it for over 5000 miles. The interior space and ride comfort have been a nice improvement over earlier Accords.,"Our overall 27 mpg combined city, suburban and highway driving is good, but with current and expected future gas costs, it might be unacceptable in the future.

We have looked at everything and we made the right decision with the Accord. IT could have a little bit more power, but over all its great. The Navigation is amazing. Its better than the one in our Z06, and that car is $60,000 more. It has all the features of a BMW and a lot less. I would recommend this car to anyone.

This car feels big inside, accommodates four large adults with ease. The trim package with the chrome looks so classy, I have received many compliments already.  Door closure is solid, leather seats are very comfortable.  I got 25 mpg around town with first tank.  No Highway travel yet.  I love the variable cylinder engine feature of the V6, I do notice it change but it is really not a big deal.  Every control placement is well thought out, although the radio controls are somewhat redundant.  I think Honda has really done well here and the added expense compared to the others in the same class is well worth it.","Smooth driving experience, handling, intuitive controls, exterior styling comparable to higher end luxury automobiles, deck lid spoiler.","Agree with others that the road noise is more than expected.  Also too many buttons for radio, it is almost if Honda was trying to ""fill the space"" in the center console.  This just takes some getting used to.

The engine has very good pick up, especially from a start, and outstanding passing power from 30 mph up, gets 25 mpg.  But the suspension is stiff, the car does not sway in tight turns, but you feel every bump.  The interior is really noisy unless the road surface is smooth. The driver's seat is nice but restrictive, holds you in one place.  The tilt steering lock is stiff and hard to set, sometimes it takes two hands to lock it in place.

Ride is very good, but seats are just a little firm.  A power passenger's seat would be a nice addition.  It's larger overall this year, so size-wise compares with an E- Class Mercedes, 5-series BMW, or A6 Audi.  Price-wise it's HALF the money, with historically outstanding value- retention.

Its build quality is at least equal to our last three Audi's (A6's, avant=wagon) and superior to our Subaru Outback.

This isn't the sticker MPG, it's from careful recording and calc. after filling up. Your break-in period for the first 600 miles is crucial - don't gun your engine during that time.

This car has excellent build quality that is unmatched by any of the competition, and along with the best Navi system of the bunch, clinched the decision for me.  The V6, while not as well-rounded as the competition, is very competent and has a satisfying growl to it.

I think the mileage would be even better with a 6-speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph.,1) Seating comfort and driving position 2) Stick shift performance 3) Availability of stick shift with high-end interior trim & options 4) Good mileage for a large car,1) 6-speed transmission 2) split-folding rear seat 3) improve trunk shape for larger boxes 4) trip computer for real-time mileage readings 5) improve turning radius

It isn't a old man's car like the Camry, has better features for less money than the Altima, and isn't a rental car like the Malibu.

I appreciate the iPod jack, but it would be nice if it were more conveniently placed, and had more interaction capabilities. I would like to be able to get Bluetooth without buying the nav system.

The seems are very tight. As far as handling, the best was I can put it is that it is very confident. The braking and acceleration are excellent. The interior design is roomy and very comfortable. The control counsel and sound system do a very solid job. You could pay $20K more for a luxury sedan. But why?","Styling, handling, acceleration, comfort,fuel economy, price.

3.75,08 Accord EX-L  V6 Rocker Arm Problems,smathes ,03/29/2008,,,4,5,4,2,,3,5,3,4,Bought car last month fully loaded without Nav.  Took it back to the dealer after a week due to a loud knocking noise when driving.  Dealer did not know what the problem was until after 3 business days.  Service bulletin out for inadequate torquing of the rocker arm bolts. Loaner car provided by Dealer but still in shop waiting for the balance parts. It has been in the shop for 1 1/2 weeks.  Very disappointed with this issue.  I did also notice poor shifting in first gear and surging between cylinder changes.  I also had wind noise coming through the moon roof while driving.

There seems to be no way to shut it off and mileage is about 26/27 highway. It can be shut- off in cold or cool weather with the voice command ""air conditioning off"".

Trunk space while is similar seems a little less usable, especially with the nav DVD box in the trunk. Mileage looks like it will be a little less than the older V6 Hondas",Stereo system is awesome.

The car is fabulous, except for one thing, it is a GAS HOG!  For a 4 cylinder honda engine we expected to get better than 23 mpg, especially since my wife drives about 90% freeway miles at 65.  The sticker said to expect up to 31, boy was that a lie!  Our 6 cylinder BMW averaged 26 mpg on the same drive!","Bold new exterior, interior as well, very comfortable seats, great for a long drive, smooth ride, ABS works great in the snow.",Gas mileage!  There is no way that a 4 cylinder should be getting such poor mileage.  I'm about ready to take it back to the dealer to see if something is wrong with it!

Plenty of room in the back for our 14 year old daughter and her two friends. Based on first two weeks everyone should buy one. Wanted a 6 speed, but impossible to find.

Have owned the Accord LX since November '07. 1400 miles. Over 60. Three months and I still can't get comfortable in the LX. In my opinion: hard seats, hard ride, more road noise than expected, disappointing gas mileage. For test drive(s), I wish I had removed the hard plastic from the driver's seat;  tried harder to get comfortable in the non-electric seat; spent more time on rough roads. I did several back to back test drives with Accord/Camry. I admit I was caught up (a bit) in the new styling of the Accord... but I do miss the more comfortable ride of my '05 & '96 Camry's.             ",Nice styling inside and out.

The advertised 21 city/31 hwy is way off.  I've put 1000 miles on mine and I'm averaging about 19 MPG.  Living in Los Angeles I do a lot of city driving, but my previous car ('03 Toyota Highlander w/ V6) got the same fuel economy.  Not good for a 4 cyl sedan.  The ride is also hard.  Again, my SUV felt softer.  Otherwise the car is comfortable, stylish, spacious and it handles well. The navi, Bluetooth, XM radio features are great.

The Honda Accord EX-L V6 with sat nav won because it was just as luxurious as the TL for a lot less money.,The V6 engine is a lot of fun to drive as I love to go fast. The interior is exactly what I was looking for... all of the modern comforts. The bluetooth and sat nav are so much for this techno geek. The heated seats are so nice to have.

My previous Honda Accord was a 1996 and it is still going strong. I hope to have the same success out of the 2008 model. I was looking for a new sedan that would have plenty of leg room for my two sons and so far I have been pleased.  I compared it to the Nissan Altima which came in a close second but the Accord had better safety features and the insurance is cheaper. I have been disappointed with fuel economy.  75% of my driving is state highways and I only get about 26-27 miles/gal. which is less than my previous 12 yr. old Accord.,"I have really enjoyed the comfort, power, alloy wheels, handling, and extra leg room for my boys.","Wider back seat to accomodate three booster seats, interior that is more resistent to dirt (I have the med gray and have to vacuum my car weekly), interior plastic scratches and scuffs easily, better gas mileage to compare to previous Honda Accords, and push button ignition"

So I traded in my 06 and got this one.  Best buy ever!!  I mean, it handles so well, turn radius actually got smaller, and not to mention how sexy this car looks.  The V6 manual transmission is still fairly new to me and having to readjust from driving a V4.  The coupe responds so well to acceleration, even at low rpms.  Gears are a bit tricky but I've only had the car for a week, so im still learning her.  But major complaints, it's definitely a very fun car to drive and handles smoothly.

We enjoyed our new Accord for about 200 miles when the rear brakes started to squeal (radio would not even drown the sound out) during braking. We took the car into the dealership (10/30/07) and they replaced the pads and scuffed the rotors. Again on 11/30/07 we took our car in for the same issue and they replaced the rear pads and rotors. Again on 12/6/07 we took the car in for the same issue and they replaced the front rotors, pads and calipers. Since then we have taken the car in 2 more times for the same squealing brakes (they still have not fixed them).",We really enjoy the navi and hands free system. The car rides well and has a roomy interior. It is easy to get a baby set in and out of the back seat compared to our loaner 2007 Accord.,Stop my brakes from squealing and I would love the car. Having to take a new car in multiple times for the same issue is getting very old (I know this is not only an issue with my car). I expected more from Honda and their customer service side.

For years, I've resisted 4 cylinder vehicles because I like to have good power while driving for quick takeoffs in the city and good speed for passing on the highway.  So far this car is a prime example of having my cake and eating it too.  The interior is luxurious and large.  I have long legs and the Accord EX-L sedan has more than enough room for me.","Great horsepower.  For a 4 cylinder vehicle, this car has great pick-up when you punch the accelerator.  I love all the interior gadgets from the XM radio to the Ipod dock to the doo- hickey that senses when I'm going fast and turns up the sound on the radio to compensate for road noise.",The BIG button on the audio console should be the power on/off and volume switch.

The few areas where I have been a little disappointed is in the fuel economy.  I have been babying the gas pedal for the first 1000 miles, but I'm still averaging about 21-22 mpg.  Some of that is likely atributed to warming the car up for about 4 to 5 minutes on cold mornings.  Also, about 60% of my driving is on local roads.  However, my old Audi A4(4cyl turbo) would average 26-27mpg driving the same routes (but driving a bit more agressively).

If this car was any faster, it would be scary!  I traded a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse GTS V6 5-speed manual, and there is no comparison.

I couldn't have asked for a better car. Although it lacks the power and acceleration that luxury cars offer, it is still an amazing vehicle. The handling is real tight and going from 50 MPH to 70 MPH is where the fun begins. When stopping at a red light, other motorist stare at the car probably trying to guess what kind of car it is.

Few problems the inside door handle holder is loose. It pops out when you pull the door handle. Also if you have the dealer installed tire pressure tire valve caps, take them off as some of them were leaking air from the tires and this car already has tire pressure monitoring so you dont need it.

The 2008 is getting anywhere from 18 to 23 mpg in town (a big difference at $3 per gallon) but I'm still seeing about 31 mpg on the highway.  The reason? Simple physics.  The car is heavier and there's 30 more horses to feed. Still, I think Honda should have considered MPG efficiency although I am a bit spoiled by the 2003.  The 2008 is a work of art. Driving is magnificent. The trade-off is a bit lower mileage but still better than most out there.","Heated mirrors and the sound system. The design is a shape-shifter. It looks like a different car in different lights. Remarkable, elevated  styling.  Nice job folks.","Get the city driving MPG to a solid 27+.

When stepping on the accelerator, it would take a moment to actually shift into gear. I also dislike the way the car down shifts when you take your foot off the pedal.  It's very noticable...moves you forward in your seat. And when shifting from one gear to the next...well it's rough. I took my car into the dealer and they said it was normal for the Accord. We even test drove another car just like mine and it did the same thing. I'm in the process of trying to give it back and filing a complaint. Who makes a car that has a delay when shifting into drive? Normal?..whatever!","The MP3 port is great for taking along the iPod. Lots of room for a ""tall"" family.","Speed sensitive volume control doesn't turn the radio down enough without having to manual control the volume, shifting issues, windshield sprayer doesn't cover the window properly to remove dirt, seats are uncomfortable after a long ride....don't purchase-- doesn't live up to Honda reputation."

Was looking for something fun, fast, comfortable and practical and got it all with this car.  Honda has stepped the Accord Coupe into a new market.  I was torn between this car and the 350Z but chose the Honda for cheaper ownership costs and better practicality.  I could not be happier with the performance and ride of this car.  I'm worried I'm going to put too many miles on it but I just want to drive it all the time!!!  Did I mention is looks absolutely beautiful in Belize Blue!  I told my friends I bought an Accord, when the saw it first time none of them believed that it was an Accord.  You'll love it!","Power!

Audio system could be better, but I'm used to really high end after-market systems.  Also, as you can imagine 268hp and front wheel drive make for some traction problems.

The passenger space is very roomy.  However, the trunk is not as big as you would like in a large- size car. Additionally, the standard seats are not my favorite.  I did try the CR-V and it felt better to drive, but my wife demanded elegance and luxury so we went with the Accord. It is such a beautiful car that I've only put 400 miles in three weeks.

From the overall exterior styling, the leather interior, dashboard, moon roof, engine, wheels, tires, and even the trunk you get nothing less than quality.

In typical Honda fashion, it likes to rev and gets downright entertaining at 4000- 7100 redline.  My last two cars were ""fast"" (WRX, TL) and I got this because my family got larger. On occasion, I do miss the power of the aforementioned vehicles, but the transmission is up to the task.  I like the grade logic control and it seems like a very intuitive transmission (knows what I want to do).  Overall, I am very satisfied on all fronts.  I prefer the nav joystick over a touchscreen for cleanliness.  Additionally, the set back nav screen is nice, and within a quick glance of my sightline.  ","Nav system.  Honda/Acura does truly provide the best nav system.  Audio system is very solid.  Came from Acura TL ELS system, and I am not feeling left out.  Gauges - very nice.  I like the high tech look of the center stack.  Back seat is HUGE.  Suspension is firm and compliant.         ","ALL MINOR, GREAT CAR - Some rattle(s) from the subwoofer area in the rear.

The Accord does everything well. Yes, the lux sedans are a bit quieter at highway speeds, but overall none can justify such a steep premium over the Accord.

4.875,This One's the Fun Accord,Linebacker68 ,12/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I had been looking seriously at getting a slightly-used (2005) 3-Series BMW for my next car.  I wanted a nice, sporty every-day driver for under $30K.  When my wife and I stopped by the Honda dealer to look at an SUV for her, I saw that they had an '08 blue Accord coupe V6, 6MT.    I'm not a fan of the previous Accord coupes, but when I took the '08 for a test drive, I was quite impressed with the nice balance of handling, ride and, of course, the power of that V6 coupled with the manual tranny.  After doing some comparison test-drives of other brands, I came back to that 6spd Accord coupe.  Honda now has a real mid-size ""driver's car.""","It's quite comfortable for my 6'2"" frame.  Shift throw seems shorter than previous models.  The Blue Pearl Metallic is gorgeous.  The body styling is a great improvement over previous Accords.  Acceleration is brisk with nice low-end power.  Nice sound on the premium stereo.","Location of MP3 plug-in (within the console) is somewhat awkward.  I could do without the XM.  6spd gearing is a bit short and takes some getting used to vs. my previous 5spd cars.   Gas mileage not good so far, but I don't have the break-in miles on it yet to know for sure."

The windshield wash barely hits the windshield but I am mostly disappointed in the gas mileage. I'm lucky if I get 23 MPG and 98% of my driving is highway. Aren't we supposed to be making improvements in this area? My 2004 was getting 28- 30MPG. Unfortunately, I regret buying this car.

4.75,Made a believer out of me,Gator 19 ,12/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,I was not intially interested in looking at the 08 Honda Accord.

I have owned a Mustang, BMW and other sports cars and really they were no more fun to drive than this car.  It's engine pulls hard and the disk brakes work smooth too.  I love the Bluetood feature.  It helps to stay connected to friends and family on the phone without having to give up the fun of the stick shift.  This is the third Honda I have owned with the Navi and I do like this version with the knob better then the touch screen.  It is easier to make minor adjustments without fiddling with the screen.

Please note that the EXL models are much more fun than the non-EXL and the V-6 with navigation is downright fun.  I thought the non-EXL and the 4cyl, were a bit boring and actually felt like a Buick.  Sorry, if you purchased one, just my opinion.  I love the EXL-V6 with the navigation package.  It is really worth the extra money.  Fuel economy is not great, but not terrible.  Driver's door is too far out at the top to serve as a left arm rest, becomes a problem on longer trips.  Seats are a bit too firm for me.  Some days the ride is excellent and others the bumps are felt right to the spine!   ","Heated seats, navigation, voice prompt, stereo, V6 power and response, interior and exterior looks, dash lighting.  Just overall a fun car to be in.","Memory seats so I don't have to adjust the power seats before I get in the car after my wife drives it.  Better door top design to serve as a left arm rest.  A bit softer ride, perhaps a soft/sport switch to go from soft to firm ride for conditions.    "
3.625,Rattles,Josh ,12/16/2007,,,3,5,2,4,,4,4,3,4,I love the car except for the rattles from the passenger side.  I noticed the compartment under the glove box was not snapped shut properly so fixed that but it still rattles worse than my 2001 Nissan Sentra on certain road surfaces.  Great handling and acceleration though.,Dash layout is great.  Seats are very comfortable.,Needs higher quality inspections prior to delivery and better finishing to stop road noice and rattles.
5,Best Honda I have ever owned.,"John of Columbus, NC ",12/16/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Have owned several Honda Accords before and the new design was really interesting. One test drive convinced us it was a superb car for us, I am 6'1"" and it has lots of leg room. Traded in a 2007 Hyundai Azera Limited that depreciated too fast for my comfort zone. The 2008 Accord EX-L with 190 hp 4 cyl is a powerful driving experience. It gave me 25.3 mpg on the 3rd tank of fuel over both city and highway driving. Leather seats are very comfortable. My car is silver with black leather. Exterior design is handsome and a decided change from previous years. Added color matching body side molding for extra protection from careless door openers. A really super vehicle.","My favorite features are the comfort of the leather seats, the XM radio, the dash design both in front of the driver and the center controls. The quietness of the engine makes driving a pleasure. I am really impressed with the great mpg. This really a fun car to drive.",Absolutely none.

No. new coupe styling is outstanding. Must see in person to really appreciate. pictures don't do it justice.  Radio isn't to bad just make sure you set the EQ to fit your music or it can get washed out. 6 cd changer is a nice treat, but the aux ","Jack is where it's really at (ipod). of course would be nice to work it through the console but not going to shed tears over it.  very quiet, smooth ride - no squeaks, rattles, or any other noise that shouldn't be there.  Trunk is a tad small but hey it's coupe - you want space get a wagon. Handling","Is what you expect. quick, tight, and responsive.  Back seat is roomy and quite comfortable for two people.

I did however like the looks of this car as it has nice clean lines and looks really sharp but I could not believe how bad the new accord drove and how cheap the car felt. I think for 25,000 you are better off looking into the Camry, Sonata or Altima. Honda take note your flagship Accord has been surpassed by Toyota, Nissan, and even Hyundai has you beat.

I currently have about 3700 miles on my new car and have had numerous problems with it.  The transmission whines in low gears, the headlights flicker while driving, the visor lights do not work, and gas mileage is on average about 25 (all my driving is on the highway).  I cannot describe how disappointed I am with this new car.  When taken to the dealer for service, they tell me most of the problems are normal.  Normal? What happened to Honda quality?

But after seeing the new Accord in the flesh it was too good to pass up. It was bigger, got better MPG, still offered a stickshift, and was cheaper.  Even our ""base"" LX has all the amenities, all the safety items we demanded, and a ton of passenger space.  The exterior, which looked so odd in pictures, is quite appealing in person. We got the black cloth interior and the polished metal exterior.  It handles flatly in corners yet doesn't punish you with a harsh ride. The shifter is typical Honda-perfect.  With a set of snow tires it's handling VT winter like a champ. ","Front seat comfort, tons of people space, incredible value for your dollar, Acura looks/Honda price. ",More colors!

I spend 3 hrs a day commuting and the car has been a little disappointing - there is hesitation when I try to accelerate; interior seat bolsters are to high and rub each time we get in and out - will wear out quickly. In cold weather the multiple piece dash layout rattles and creaks for 40 minutes until the interior warms up. Cubic ft of trunk is large but odd interior shape prevents effective use for large luggage pieces. Wipers and window wash are recessed below defroster line and freeze in place with defroster on.

It's reasonable comfortable and very roomy. The engine is a little harsh sounding. I feel a lot of vibration on the steering wheel when I'm on the highway. The stereo is typical Honda which isn't saying much. The dash is nice but the plastics seem on the cheap side. No outside temp gauge, my fathers toyota corolla has that. One thing I really like about this car is the bodystyle. I really think Honda hit a homerun with it, very classy but sporty at the same time.",Bodystyle!! Roominess.,Interior plastics. Stereo system.

The V6 is great, amazing stereo, navigation is outstanding. It has enough room to fit a car seat and have two people comfortable in the back. The only drawback is that my car vibrates at around +60mph. I will be taking it back to the dealer - dont know if it is wheels or engine. The ride is not smooth - the main purpose I bought the V6 was for a comfortable ride and to avoid frequent trips to dealership for fixes and repairs. Will have to wait and see how Honda service measures up against the Audi and VW which were very dissapointing.  All in all, we love the V6 with Navi","Interior design, stereo, pc card in trunk (only with Navi) - unfair to call it only Navi - it is a info hub - great utlity - truly the best in induistry.

It's a nice luxury car that's not stuffy. In a cost per feature comparison, it outdoes it's counterparts the CRV and 2 door coupe.  The first 3 days of ownership saw me driving in heavy rain and sleet. It was nice to have this car with it's traction control just overall great handling.

I wanted red. The ONLY red in the 4 door sedan is a HIDEOUS brownish-purplish red. As a lover of all things red, I cannot call the basque pearl ""red"" red.

It has a great power to economy ratio, the leather seating and interior controls are functional, easy to use and comfortable.

This new Honda feels like a very well put together Chevy Impala. Its designed for American roads and American families so I suppose thats fine. So far, and I have only had it a week, I find it like driving a barge. I dont care for it but its not so bad that I can say I hate it. It just not fun to drive. Its fine on the interstate but parking is clunky and I dont long to drive it like I did my old BMWs. Alas, now I own it. I wish Honda had a return policy.

The Lexus is a tiny bit quieter and a little smoother over the bumps, but the Accord feels sportier and steering feels tighter.

Great to drive, but expensive to purchase and maintain. Well, the 2008 Accord pushed me over the edge. Not only is it well made and enjoyable to drive, it actually compares to much more expensive cars. The doors make that German car ""thunk"" when you close them. The suspension feels sophisticated and is smooth on the open road, handles bumps without harshness, and easily handles canyon curves. The interior is first rate. The nav system is impressive.

Instead it just offers a very solid feel, more then competent acceleration, tons of very comfortable space, great sounding audio, decent fuel economy and handles more Germanic then Japanese. It brings a smile when I look at it parked, and the smile only widens as I move down the road. Visually appealing, great tactile feel from all that you touch in the cabin, and if your right foot develops an attitude, you'll find both whats under the hood and all the chassis components more then up to the task of keeping that smile in place.",Solid feel. Great audio. Interior room. Handling. Acceleration,Larger trunk
5,Nice as a BMW 3 Series,mhunt2000 ,10/08/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I just purchased my 2008 Honda Accord V6 this past weekend. As a previous BMW owner i was extremely impressed with Honda's finished product. The new Accord shares some design cues with BMW on the sides, trunk, and front headlights. The fit and finish are top- notch, and the performance is good as well. I dont think im going to miss my BMW. ","Interior, navigation voice commands, comfort.

It's the first car I bought sight unseen and no test drive. I knew I was going to get it when Honda first previewd the concept at the Detroit show in Jan. I was a bit apprehensive wrt the VCM and the new polished metal metalic color. The color is awesome looking good in all light environments, but especially at night.  I'm surprised how much the VCM kicks in. I know I can milk mileage with my driving style and requirements. Going from 200 hp & 16"" whells to 268 hp and 18"" wheels is a huge difference in handling. Cockpit/Cabin looks great at night.  Looking forward to it.","Motor, 270 W stereo, Phat wheels, good brakes, the little blue light that lights the console at night.  Best of all are the looks and thumbs up from surrounding drivers.  ","Woofer makes the rear-view mirror vibrate the image, but it does it to the beat. The trunk is a little smaller making a scary moment when I thought my golf clubs wouldn't fit in. They fit in the width and not the length which is opposite of the 2000 Coupe.  I couldn't rate anything but 10..."
5,Everything I expected,Econ1 ,10/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After 12 years of a BMW 3-series convertible, I looked for something with the same excellent driving characteristics and handling. I do not drive 10/10ths, but enjoy responsive handling and a decent compromise between comfort and firmness.  This is it. 3-series BMWs have very little, if anything, to offer for someone like me over this car.  It has great cornering, excellent acceleration, and a great interior. I personally love the exterior styling - YMMV. I expected to miss the touch screen navi that we've had for 4 years on our Acuras, but I'm even happier with the new model -- seems to do a much better job of speech recognition than our 2006 MDX.  I couldn't be happier with it.",Bluetooth (one reason I waited for the 2008 model to come out); power; handling; nav,Light in the rear seat; ventilation that you can direct for rear seat passengers.

4.875,Impressed ,Bug4 ,10/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"Picked up my silver EX-L with black leather and a spoiler last weekend. I love it!  I'm a fan of the exterior styling, but what most impresses me is the interior and the way the car drives.  The interior's design, looks and quality have grown on me since I first drove the car. The automatic transmission is smooth and very predictable. I hate auto trannys, but think I'm going to be able to live with this one. I love the responsiveness of the throttle. The car's handling is very competent and even a little sporty when you push it. After looking at almost every car on the market under $35k, I think this is the best bang for the buck - certainly not perfect-but a very nice car for the money!","Standard features, automatic transmission performance, ride/handling, wheel design on the EX models, interior design, and getting that much zip out of a 4cyl. engine. I also happen to like the exterior design. ",No pleaded leather (it creases and doesn't look as good as stretched leather in the long-run); better upgraded stereo (where's the mid- range?); painted front grill (or chromed); very hard to get 5speed manual in EX-L; get 190ft/lbs of torque out of the upgraded 4cyl-then you'd have a real performer!
5,Best Honda Yet,Honda5101 ,10/05/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This new Accord is absolutely amazing! The ride is great, the noise level is low, the features are ergonomic, everything is perfect.

5,Everything I expected from Honda!,HondaSC ,10/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Waited until this car was released to purchase new car.  Was considering Lexus IS350, Acura TL, and Toyota Camry. This car was so impressive that I am glad we waited. We were a little leary of the Toyota engines since we already own a 1998 Lexus ES300 and have had engine sludge problems that seem to doom several of the Toyota V6 engines. Very impressed with the added room with the new body style and the power of the new 3.5 L engine is a nice step up for Honda. Was curious to test the VCM to see if it was noticeable but was very impressed with its ability to drop and add the cylinders as needed without notice to the driver or passengers. Very impressed with this car!","Everything!

The interior finish is acceptable for the price range and durable. I dislike the number of buttons on the center console, but find them well-placed and logical. I'm 6' and find the front seats to be very comfortable. I dislike pleaded leather; it looks great, but tends to crease. The wire throttle is incredibly responsive, the brakes predictable and the auto transmission is flawless. The 4cyl. engine feels much more powerful than in the 08 Camry and I find the shift points to be more appropriate. Handling is sporty, not racy, but much more responsive than the Camry.

5,Best Accord Ever,Westies96 ,09/26/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is the BEST! It is real comfortable, holds the road well, and has great pick up. I purchased a Polished Metal Metallic color with gray leather inside. Since I've gotten it, I have been stopped by many people asking if it was the new Accord. Some say it looks like an Acura RL, others say that it looks like a BMW. Whatever it looks like I am happy that I purchased it. The feel of driving in the car is great. I look forward to driving trips to the grocery store. The car gives the ride of a much more expensive car. The interior is appointed very nicely. ","I love the XM radio, leather heated seats, and the design of the dashboard. The exterior is also very sleek. Honda outdid themselves this time. Why pay $5000 more for an Acura, when you can buy this car. I love the new 190 HP engine in my EX-L. I feel like I'm driving in a 6 cyl not a 4 cyl. ","None except that there needs to be an adjustment made to the brakes. My car has a slight squeal when you first apply the brakes. It is not a safety issue, just an annoyance. I had my car in the service area for this issue. They said that there was a service advisory but they have not released a fix."

I was not overly impressed with the early photos I saw of this vehicle online either.  However, once I was in the V6 version (the 4 is a dog) that all changed.  It looks sharp, seems much larger than it looks, is quick, and handles like a dream.  It is right on par with my old 325.  I passed on the nav system as it is no longer a touch screen and is far more difficult to use than last year's version. Very solid build.  Richer interior than past Accords.  Little road noise even with 17 inch wheels.","Quick, very quiet engine (4 banger is loud), little road noise lots of interior space, even in the back seat, well placed controls for the most part.  Feels as solid as a European sedan.  For an Accord it gets a lot of looks.  Rich interior.  Very nice sound system.",Go back to touch screen nav system. Tail end could be a little prettier but it is not exactly ugly.  Much nicer looking than the online photos.  Get rid of huge knob controller on the dash.  Trunk could be bigger.
5,First time Honda ,omela1 ,09/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,I have been a Toyota lover for more than 10 years but did not like the new design.  I was ready to purchase the BMW 328 but opted for the Honda Accord.   The 2008 Honda is awesome.  Luxury design with economy pricing. Handling is great and fun to drive. ,"Leather interior, XM radio comfortable rear seats.",None.  Honda got the new design right.
5,A nine month odyssey,Finally ,09/25/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"After approx. 9 months with a 2007 Camry LE, I found the car I thought I bought.  The 2008 Accord EX (no V6) is as perfect as a car can get under $30,000.  Where Toyota dropped the ball on the 07 Camry, Honda picked it up and has a brilliant car.  I cannot find any fault whatsoever with the EX performance - tight but very positive, smooth, exactly responsive steering, and the suspension like the rock of Gibraltar, barely transmitting bumps on the road, but not too soft or teeth-jarring like 'sport' suspensions. The acceleration of the EX I4 puts the Camry V6 to shame.","Everything!! Large, roomy car. Superb steering, superb I4 pick-up, super stable suspension, not a shake or a roll, no leaning while turning. The cloth ivory interior is so good, don't waste money on leather. With my neck and back surgeries the 8-way seat divine. Center info console screen.",Seat memory.  Auto-dimming rear-view and compass only on EX-L.  Should be standard.

4.5,Honda Accord Scores,Larry S. ,09/23/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,5,4,The 2008 Accord EX-L V6 is refined styling both inside and out. The first thing I noticed is the firm leather seats and busy dashboard. I managed to program in some XM stations on the ride home from the dealership. Pick up is great from stop or merging on the highway at 60 mph. Navigation is not intuitive but does accept voice prompts. I have had to spend some time reading through the navigation owner's manual to help get a handle on it. To my great surprise the automatic mileage calculator has me at 24 mpg in town. The Accord has a very european feel on the inside which reminds me of the BMW 3 series. Extra perks such as tire pressure monitoring and heated seats are great.   ,My favorite features are the navigation and the stereo with subwoofer gain control. ,The bluetooth feature seems complicated. It would be more usable if the link up was more automated.

First and foremost, it's literally the cheapest Accord that we've seen material wise. Gone are the LED-illuminated tachometer, LED brake lights, and illumination lights on all 4-doors. Gone are the individualized engine component protectors that were so touted in the previous generation Accord. The elegant and simple-to-use interior of the previous model has been replaced with cluttered and confusing array of buttons. The quality of the interior material is vastly inferior to the previous models - it looks and feels CHEAP. ","The tiny, triangular door lock buttons are not only not user-friendly, they're down-right dangerous. The truck space, while at first glance looks deeper, has been rendered useless due to the widened wheel wells intruding from both sides. The ride is harsh on your body, and car response is sluggish.","In summary, to those who know the ""OLD HONDA"", the 2008 Accord is a giant step backward and it does not deserve the Honda name.  It's an inferior product and quite frankly for the price, there are several American models that deliver more bang for the buck.  Honda is no longer manufacturing qualit"

5,Better than expected,Russ ,09/20/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Smooth, cormfortable and a pleasure to drive. Compared to my 04 Accord which is a great car, this one is superior by every measure. The seats are cushioned better and the side bolsters are excellent. The lumbar is inflatable as opposed to a lever and only lacks up/down adjustability for different height drivers. As was my previous Accord, the fit and finish is superb.  The steering is outstanding and the brakes are superb. Wind noise is near zero and the transition from 6 to 4 to 2 cylinders is seemless.

This car looks, feels, and rides like a much more expensive car. It looks and rides like an Acura RL or a Lexus. The new 190HP 4cylinder engine has great pick up. You feel like you're floating on the highway and have great control over the car. Honda far surpassed Toyota (Camry) and Nissan (Altima) when they created this vehicle.

Was able to purchase appox $1000 below sticker, even though other dealers in Houston quoted $2K to $3K over sticker. The exterior of the car is a real head turner. The interior is a step up from the previous Accord. It is not lacking in anything, but it is also not extraordinary. It is what it is, a family sedan. I choose this car over a Camry, Aura, and Civic because it has the best combination of reputation, performance, price, and initial quality",Exterior. Intsrumentation is nice. Potential resale value.

Power is wonderful, the seats hurt after only 200 miles of driving. Maybe I will get used to them. Overall interior size of car is wonderful but the trunk is a little small in relation to the car. Beware - you can feel the engine move from 3 cylinders, to 4 then 6. Test drive to make sure you can live with this  First impressions are overall good. But at $30k, I could have purchased a much more involved car (Audi, BMW,), this rides like a Buick.","Great power, Nice stereo with nice bass extension.
