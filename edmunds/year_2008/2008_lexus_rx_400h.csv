Although it doesn't have the bells whistles of my wife's 2013 GS 350, it drives great, is easy to maintain, and gets great mileage.  Of course, I've had the Oil and Filter changed, and tires rotated every 5,000 Miles, plus any other factory recommend maintenance items.About six months ago, I was with the Director of Aviation, and the Chief Pilot of a well known German Automobile Company.  I asked the director of aviation how many plants they had around the world. He counted them up and said about 13.  I then asked him which one had the best quality control.  Without blinking, he responded, LEXUS.",,

After much research I decided to use only REGULAR gas in it since it seems that Premium is more about performance than fuel economy. I'll probably throw in an additive every three months or so. Having driven it about 2500 km. (about 1500 miles), I'm averaging 8.6L / 100km. which is just over 27mpg. And that's on REGULAR Gas. My 2010 2.4L 4 cyl.

High speed highway (75-84) is only around 22.When I get the higher mileage it's usually when most of the driving is at lower speeds as you would expect.I noticed a review of this vehicle by someone stating poor mileage. There was either something wrong with the vehicle or it was due to poor driving habits.Way too many people blast up to the light and hit the brakes.Then they hit the gas hard taking off.Dumb-de-dumb.If you use softer driving habits you will get 26-28.You have to be thinking hybrid.Smart drivers will see the good mileage.Navigation works well with two exceptions.  First is it's incredibly dumb that a passenger can not program the vehicle while the car is in motion.  Second is the warning notice which displays for 5 or 6 seconds everytime you hit the NAV button.  There should be a way to stop it from doing that.,,

Have driven it a week now and am getting 28.2 MPG around town and on the highway combined. Have had no problems. It is fun to drive and is very comfortable. I see some reviews stating poor mileage. Not here. If you want to drive it like a regular car, quick acceleration, high speeds, you will get the performance of a regular car. I had to learn to drive the hybrid properly and it is great.

I had a 2003 Lexus Rx300 which was nice, but I needed an upgrade. The Rx400h is definitely an upgrade as it has many nice features. The 0-60 time of ~7 sec is very good for a v6 SUV, and the acceleration is very quick. My only complaints are the lack in seat comfort and lack of advertised gas mileage. I'm getting around 23mpg combined vs the 30 as advertised. Also the fact that the car doesn't have the new ""smart key"" feature as the rest of the 08 Lexus lineup has. But other than that, i am very satisfied!

I don't understand the complaints about gas mileage. With a little coaching from the onboard ""consumption"" feature in the navigation system I am routinely getting between 29 and 30 mpg. 24-26 is a high speed highway average, 28-30 around town, and 30-33 in stop and go driving.","Hybrid engine with lots of zip and great mileage, steering and suspension makes this SUV feel like a sports car, luxury interior looks and feels great, seats that have the heating feature in both the seat and lower back.

Town driving at average 27 to 29 MPG. Latest trip (Interstate and mountains) averaged 26.1 MPG., again at 72 MPH. Acceleration is both excellent and fun. This is our third Lexus (2nd RX) and it's by far the best. If your gas mileage isn't AT LEAST as good as the EPA estimate, work on modifying your driving style.

It took me over a month to get used to the subtle changes you need to make to maximize your fuel economy.  It is so quiet for an SUV and very comfortable.  Whether I am alone, with my grandchildren, or my parents, everyone raves about the comfort of the ride.  ","I don't really have one, but my grandchildren love the integrated Bluetooth phone to talk to their grandfather or parents.

I wonder if the non-hybrid gets worse gas mileage?  Also, the battery and engine make a lot of noise.  The CVT is awkward at best, and not a luxury item.  Kinda of like calling a dude ranch luxury hotel. It still a ranch and smells like a ranch no matter how nice the beds.  I am not even going to mention my unhappiness with the lockout function on the nav and blue tooth.  If I could do over, I would save 15 grand and buy the 350 or the Acura RDX.

5,Exceeded My Expectations,T Owens ,12/01/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Extraordinary would be the best word that describes my driving experience in the Lexus RX400h AWD. It came with all the bells and whistles that one would expect from Lexus. The vehicle is exceptionally comfortable, fun, and easy to drive.  Although this is my 2nd SUV and 1st hybrid, it is by far superior to the 16.5 MPG Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer that I use to own.  What's truly remarkable is the outstanding power performance when you need it, and the equally outstanding fuel economy in stop and go city traffic.  Knowing that the 400h is very quiet in the hybrid mode has heightened my situational awareness when people are nearby on foot, as it's almost as loud as an electric golf cart.","Getting 31 MPH in a 24 MPH expected world. The technology involved in creating this vehicle is remarkable. Everything functions better then the PlaneView Avionics on a Gulfstream G550.  Toyota has exceeded my expectations with this puppy.  Easy to use, fun to operate, and a thrill to drive.","Variable speed fan on the environmental control system Rather than a multi-speed fan.

We do most of our driving around town.  We are very disappointed in the city gas mileage which is 21 to 22 mpg.  Not the 26 mpg we expected.  The dealer and Lexus blows our complaints off.  We live in a coastal area meaning the closest we come to a mountain is a bridge.  Our city driving meets Lexus' statement for the 26 mpg.  However, we do get 26 mpg on the interstate.  Go figure. Otherwise, we very much like the vehicle.","Comfort, backup camera and nav system.",Ability for the passenger to use the nav system/bluetooth phone book while the driver drives.  Lexus Link.
4.75,The Current Logical Choice,sawjai ,07/08/2008,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,4,"Lexus has always been cushy rides, but definitely not on the sporty side of the equation especially since our everyday vehicles are a C230 and G35. The steering is a little vague steering into curves. Acceleration is good at all speeds, but you'll need to get used to the way the engine buzzes from the CVT. Gas mileage has averaged 27 mpg w/cruise control active even around 70 mph on the freeway. On a recent road trip on very hilly terrain we still averaged over 27 mpg, light on the gas. Brakes are a little difficult to modulate because of the regenerative system. We preferred the ML styling and driving dynamics to the RX, but so far find that the RX400h is a very nice ride indeed.",Fuel economy for this size vehicle is very impressive with the hybrid system. The backup camera is awesome. The navigation system takes some time to learn but a very powerful tool.,"The lack of an aux input and iPod adapter standard is a real put off. Dealership wanted $700 to install adapter, I demanded and got a lower price. More center console open storage for cell phones and misc. stuff. Noise level. Passenger use of nav system.

Perfect size for active sports oriented people who need an SUV but drive alone with occasional passengers. Gas savings is a plus but the real perk is the V8 power with 4 cylinder mileage. Lots of personal storage space and excellent ergonomics. Nav and stereo system are great. This car will retrain you on how to drive properly. I came from a BMW 550 sedan and GX 470 and didn't realize how wasteful I was on the pedal. Highly recommend this vehicle. Great for long distance travel with small family.

It has been a real pleasure to drive. We currently have 5000 miles on it and use it almost exclusively anytime we need to go anywhere. Has good pep and the gearless transmission is very smooth. Lexus provided the first 2 maintenance free. I looked at the book however nothing needs maintenance other than the traditional engine. The batteries are warranted for 9 years. ,The performance between 30-70+ MPH is awesome. Love the fact that the car runs on battery anytime you are under 40 MPH and not gunning the engine.

Don't bother with the Mark Levinson stereo; but do opt for the built-in GPS with Bluetooth and rear view camera.

My regeneration worked perfect until the battery pack showed fully charged.  Ever since then the regen works about 60% of the time. Two dealers have looked at it and found nothing. Now I have video proof I will take in this week to see how they will ignore my issue. If you get 19-22 mpg in the city your regen is also not working well. When it is working and you drive responsibly you will get 27 in the city. The RXh is wonderful and smooth and safe, but I bought a hybrid and expect it to work.
