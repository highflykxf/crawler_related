Had it checked out by a local Honda dealership and came back good except for the passenger rear sport shock was leaking and needed to be replaced... no big deal, until I found out that you can only get the sport shock from Acura at $700 a pop...OK!!My only gripe about the truck though, ours has sport, entertainment, tech and tow packages... the only thing it doesn't have is the back-up sensors that beep.It's grey with grey interior and it looks awesome... you can tell its a solid truck when driving it, no rattles and very firm when in sport mode.

However, after putting about 10,000 miles on it during a cross-country move, we have found a few disappointing features.  The leather seats are showing more ""wear & tear"" than I would expect for a vehicle this age.  The leather quality in my Subaru is far better!  The leather has pulled up from the center console and is loose.  The radio is a bit quirky, as it resets the radio stations randomly to the factory settings (and no, its not because of the Driver 1 & Driver 2 keys).  The paint seems to chip VERY easily.  A beautiful car altogether, though, and a smooth ride that easily pulled a large U-haul trailer through the Rocky Mountains!","Bluetooth, AWD, satellite radio, third row seat, reclining second row seat, rear A/C & heat","better quality leather, better exterior paint, move exterior temperature gauge to center display "

5,Excellent SUV,Satisfied in TX ,04/19/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I narrowed down our choice for a reliable, slightly used mid-size luxury SUV to the MDX.  We made a great choice!  We considered a Mazda CX-9, Lexus RX 350, Toyota Highlander and Volvo XC-90 and the MDX topped them all in our book.   The MDX hugs the road incredibly better than any of the other SUVs, nearly driving itself most of the time.  The power from the 300 hp V6 is at its best from 40-70 MPH and makes interstate driving easy & exhilarating.  The interior quality far exceeds the other SUVs out there and it's tough to pass on Acura (Honda Motors) storied reliability and low maintenance. Gas mileage is average compared to others above, but the extra performance is worth it!","300 hp V6, SH-AWD, interior quality and design. The excellent handling has got to be my favorite part. It's an SUV that drives like a sports car.  ROOMY second row seats that recline (not much, but a little helps!) ","Better gas mileage would be great, but performance comes with costs. "
4.75,Great trip car,Cat ,04/08/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,4,"Love the MDX, it is very comfortable on the highway.  We are averaging around 21 mpg in mixed driving. We bought ours used and have had a problem with the driver's side mirror rotating down in reverse, then not coming back up to the correct position. Also, after driving a Lexus RX300 the steering in this SUV makes the SUV feel heavy, not as nimble as the RX300.","Love the tech package and XM radio, comfortable seats, room for extra passengers for a short distance.","Heavy feeling steering, makes the SUV feel heavier than it looks.

4.875,2007 Acura MDX,Love it ,01/28/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After a long exhaustive search for a luxury SUV which was not too big and not too small, we found the MDX. We purchased our 2007 MDX used but in like new condition. Could not be happier with the performance, style and overall handling of this vehicle. This performance vehicle is quick, agile, easy to drive and stylish all in one package.","GPS, auto climate control, sound system, and the handling in snow is awesome.","Extended warranty on powertrain to 100k, ability to update the Navigation system mapping and improve the overall gas mileage."
4.375,"Great SUV, love it",Tim ,01/18/2010,,,5,4,5,5,,4,4,3,5,"This was our first luxury vehicle purchase. We bought the 07 Sport/Ent with 18K miles from an Acura dealership (Certified). We compare it to X5, ML, and the RX and the Acura had many more features, and more value than the competitors. Sporty feel, good power once the rpms climb, nice interior. Wish the interior was more quiet at highway speed and the LED for the sport button and the trunk release button died but luckily replaced under warranty.","Love the easy to use Nav, Hands free voice, and the XM display with the nav makes surfing for music fun.",Nothing really to report.
4.75,Love it!,AB ,12/30/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I leased Acura MDX in February 2007. Loved it from day 1. It is stylish, sporty, and everything I could have asked for. I can drive alone, or load family and friends and still enjoy the ride.  The one thing I don't like in Acura MDX are the front wipers. They stink! The wipers started jumping within few months of my buying the MDX and Acura could not fix it. So I am living with it. My transmission failed once and they fixed it because it was under warranty.  Anyway, I think MDX is a great car. I love every bit of it. ","Sporty style, looks, 7 seats.","Front wipers, rear view camera should be standard."
3.875,Second Acura and keep coming back,MDXOWNER ,12/20/2009,,,4,5,4,4,,4,5,1,4,"This is our second Acura (first was a 2005 TL) and I purchased the MDX for my wife because we needed more room for a growing family.  Its been two years and it still turns heads on the road (even mine after I park it) because the styling is simple, yet screams I have 300 hp under this hood.  Overall, you cannot go wrong with the Acura brand from a prestige, reliability and value standpoint.  The MDX is upscale and its easy to scoff at BMW or Mercedes because of the superb value of the MDX.  Acura has simple options and doesnt hold you hostage with multiple option packages in order to get what you want.",Power and the engine growl is nice. The xenon headlights and LED rear lights are awesome.  They are extremely bright (especially with fog lights on) and everyone knows you are coming.  The aggressive exterior styling is eye-catching.

4.875,07 MDX / Tech pkg.,Don ,12/18/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought a new MDX in 02 and was very happy with it. The few things I didn't like were resolved in the 07 redesign. For a sport ute I'm happy with the ride quality, reduced road noise, seat comfort, power and handling. At 38 K miles the AC quit but was repaired under warranty. The 1st of 4 Acuras to ever go in the shop for a repair. I don't like the vertical spoke at the bottom of the steering wheel where my hands want to rest on long drives. I think it's a bargain relative to the price of the BMW or Porsche. ",Very comfortable front seats. Superb sound system. All driver controls are placed perfectly. Nav system very good and easy to operate. Hands free link works very well. ,I think it could use a better looking set of wheels. Put a power source in the console with the aux input.

4.875,I keep going back to Acura,FlewByU ,08/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I just moved to Germany two months ago and bought an 07 MDX from another military member.  It has everything I could want.  We just returned from a week driving through the Alps and this SUV is simply amazing.  Granted, I get to drive it much faster than I could in the states, but even at 120 MPH, it was rock solid. We need the AWD for the snow and the kids stay entertained with the AV system. Plenty of passing power and very comfortable on long trips. Acuras are rare in Germany and I get stares all the time by curious Bavarians wondering what kind of vehicle I have. If you are in the market for a luxury SUV for family touring, with cool tech toys to play with, MDX can't be beat. ",The separate controls for the rear  passengers are awesome.  I can control temp and AV from the front or switch to rear. Sound system is amazing.  I will sometimes sit in the driveway and just listen. Also has a 120v outlet in console.  Great for us since we live with 220v and need 120 on occasion. ,"I will have to add a few things that I didn't have to add on my 4Runner, i.e. a roof rack and a hitch.  Also gas mileage is not great, but at 100 mph on the Autobahn, what else would I expect.  "
4.625,no regrets,cvillemdx ,07/30/2009,,,4,4,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"After months of careful research and test drives at BMW, Lexus, Volvo, etc. I settled on the MDX without a doubt in mind. I love the way the car handles, no stiffness or resistance in the steering or acceleration.  The interior design is a little Star Trek for me, but once I figured everything out, it is a pleasure to have all the extras (XM radio, navigation, Bluetooth, backup camera, etc.)","The self-adjusting side mirrors which rotate to give you a view of the curb/lines as you back up. Makes backing into parking spaces and parallel parking a breeze, along with the back-up camera. Also a fan of the push-to-talk for my cell phone.","Auto-open for the back hatch should be standard. There IS an iPod link in all MDX (I don't know why people are saying there's not) it's inside the center console. Buy an AUX cord and you're good to go (looks like a two-way headphone connector.)

Great performance, plenty of power and AWD when skiing, plenty of room for baggage, great MPG for an SUV, navi system is far superior to GM's Suburban (don't have to put in park to change your destination, etc).

Handling, power and ride are outstanding. Back seats are a little less comfortable for my tall teenagers. Back cargo area is very roomy, and easily expandable with 3rd seat folded and back seats down. I drive up snowy, often treacherous mountain canyons to ski in the winter.

It is so much fun to drive; looks & feels luxurious so no problem pulling up to upscale places! I didn't want to give up space to pop things in the back and go so I keep the third seat down & purchased the rubber mat for the back. I have plenty of room while at the same time I am ""zippy""; easily pulling into parking spaces and getting around town. I love the navigation system, although it does need updating and the bluetooth is wonderful, although for some reason it keeps unhooking my Treo phone which the Acura people say is the phone's fault. LOVE IT & would buy it again.","Large storage area, hands free phone with the bluetooth & voice recognition is safe. The heaviness of it feels safe and large interior is very comfortable. ",Better gas mileage and ability to use regular gas. I get around 16-17 mpg around town. I like my friend's car that beeps when backing up as opposed to the camera which still feels awkward & is slow at start.

4.625,Fantastic,TerribleJ ,01/02/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"It is a fun SUV to drive. The engine is smooth, the white lights are super bright, the sound system is amazing and it does not feel like a big car behind the wheels. It handles amazingly well in the snow and would likely recommend it to anyone. I just went through a B1 service, oil change and tire rotation, which cost me $56. It seems fair compared to the maintenance on the Audi. We do a lot of highway driving and average 19 MPG and it took about 7500 miles before the service light came on. We have an Accord and Honda USA treated us well. We got rid of our Audi and went with a Honda product. We made the right choice. ",AWD. Excellent car for winter driving. Sound system is great. The best GPS system that I used. It is a good size SUV but it does not feel big behind the wheel and blind spot is minimal.

This SUV has much less pick up than my 01 V8 Grand Cherokee which it replaced (I leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way too high rpm) - but slightly better gas mileage for a larger car (the onboard mile computer is off by the way).  Rear camera takes 10 sec when backing up (making it much less useful).  Also mismatching color bumper is tacky IMO for $45k car (I picked silver body which blends the best). Instrument cockpit is WAY too busy with DVD/nav system (and I'm a techy).,"Outside style, pretty interior, good value vs BMW X5/X3 I was also looking at.

4,Ups and downs,Alex ,08/08/2008,,,4,4,4,5,,5,5,1,4,First thing I want to say is that this SUV handles better than a vehicle this large and high should.  Honda/Acura did a great job with the suspension and driver aids.   The interior space is very nice.  This car is wider than most of the competition so that translates into more passenger comfort when you have more than two passengers in the back seat. The third row is fine for kids or adults on short trips.  I am disappointed in the gas mileage.  In the city I am lucky to get over 12 mpg.   On the highway I get about 19.  Nowhere near the numbers advertised.  I also find it pretty pathetic that a $40K+ vehicle has fake plastic wood.  I have had panel gap issues.  ,Interior comfort.  The suspension is a good compromise between controlled ride and comfort. Good power.  ,Drop about 500 lbs.  That will get you better gas mileage and even better handling.

I must confess this is probably the best vehicle Honda has ever made, right up there with such ground breakers as the NSX and s2000. Honda has simply built an SUV version of the Acura RL.

We did the head to head test drives with the BMW X5, Porsche Cayenne and other top brand crossovers so the buying decision was very easy thereafter. It outperformed everything.  Having had several Acuras in the past, the build quality is simply awesome. One test drive will sell this SUV.","The technology package is very nice.  Very roomy interior and quite luxurious inside.  Lots of headroom and legroom.  The audio system is exquisite. Switchable comfort/sport ride is awesome.  Has a very sporty, wide stance that keeps the vehicle on sure footing even when cornering at high speed.  ","The SUV should come with roof racks, side steps and power rear door standard. Redesign the front grille. It is a gas guzzler (but so fun to drive) - needs better MPG!!  "
4.375,Review after 8 months,dsjunk ,02/02/2008,,,5,5,2,4,,5,5,4,5,"This is a great vehicle but... in the 8 months I have owned it Acura had to replace the windshield (flaw causing distortion), adjust 2 of the door handles (installed wrong), replace the muffler (broken interior baffle), replace a rear strut (failed), replaced the battery (dead cell), fix the dash and trim (installed incorrectly) and other minor items.  Mine has had horrible build quality, although my dealer is fantastic. I bought Acura because we have had great cars from Honda, but this isn't built nearly as well as my wife's Odyssey. But, no SUV out there drives this well. If you are considering, buy the SPORT, it's worth the money.","Bluetooth is FANTASTIC. Nav is good. I like the split 3rd row, it makes it much more functional. The clamshell center armrest is actually really useful. It drives SO WELL. The Sport just sticks like a sports sedan. XM radio rocks.  I never thought I would want it, I bought a 3 year package!","Build quality (on mine) is an embarrassment to Acura.  Too much cheap plastic on the dash.  For a car of this price range, it should be real wood. For a car that touts safety, it should have rear back up sensors, the camera is good, but no replacement for sensors. "
4.875,What a fun-to-drive vehicle!,CLopez ,01/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Traded in my 2001 Lexus RX 300 for a fully-loaded 2007 MDX, and what a difference. The ride is not as comfortable/quiet as the Lexus but one can easily get used to its comfort level. Drove down to FL from NJ, and was so comfortable driving that I drove straight on the way back. The kids loved the Entertainment System that they did not even bother using the game system which we can plug in the truck too. Averaged around 20-21 MPG on our trip, and was very pleased with the good acceleration on the highways. Constantly getting looks hopefully due to its handsome styling. My only complain is that the voice recognition falters. I really enjoy driving this vehicle (which I think drives like a car).","Engine, navigation system, DVD/ES, backup camera, active damper control, SH-AWD, & styling.","Better MPG, better voice recognition, more bluetooth compatibility, a hybrid version, & auto-dimming side mirrors."
4.75,I LOVE MY MDX,Acurafan ,01/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"My husband and I fell in love with the MDX in 02; bought it and when we needed a second vehicle, got another one in 03.  Kept going and got the 07.  We wanted a change and test drove the X5. Nice ride but for the bang and the buck, the MDX was the clear winner!! I love the way the vehicle moves and the smooth braking action is awesome; not to mention the way it hugs the curb as I try to see what it can do... wow!!  No vehicle is safe but I feel a sense of security in my MDX.  Who knows... might be riding an 08 in the upcoming months.  I didn't think it was possible to improve on the vehicle but wow... they did!!!",Stability and smooth braking action. Stereo system and navi. Bluetooth handsfree link ,
4.875,Drives Like A Car!,JLopez ,01/04/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Traded in my 2001 Lexus RX 300 for a fully-loaded 2007 MDX. The ride was not as luxurious as the Lexus, but one can easily get used to its comfort level. Drives like a car! Drove it down to Disney from NJ; enjoyed driving too much that I didn't even bother stopping (except for gas) on the way back. The kids love the DVD so much that they did not even use with their game system. MPG wasn't that bad either (averaging 19/21). Overall, I think the build and ride is not equal to that of the Lexus, but they are still within very excellent standards. I enjoy using the manual mode for better acceleration on the highways. Regularly gets looks from people -  hopefully because of its handsome styling.","Navigation system, backup camera, powerful engine, entertainment system, active damper control, SH-AWD, power rear hatch, 3rd row, & FUN TO DRIVE ",Improve delay on the nav system & backup camera. Better MPG. Better voice recognition. More compatibility of phones to Hands-Free Link BT. Better iPod interface to the nav system. Backup sensors.
4.875,Excellent Upgrade,jrt ,11/27/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I upgraded from an original 2001 MDX to this one and am very impressed by the quality and features they've added to the car.  Makes my old one feel very bare bones.   We did a 1,400 mile road trip over Thanksgiving with the new MDX and loved every moment.  Powerful engine, feels wide and stable on the road, tracks well through corners, good sight lines.  Very nice. The seats are very comfortable. The front seating areas are a little confining by design. Navi and entertainment systems are both very well done. Cargo space could be a little larger but larger space = larger body = more weight = fewer MPG.  So it's not a bad balance as is.  Overall I'm very pleased with this SUV.",Navi and entertainment package are terrific though be sure to get trained by the dealer on operation.  It can be pretty confusing to get started.,Full size spare tire.  Available distance-tracking cruise control and lane drift warning.
3.75,Second and last MDX,Dan McMahon ,11/26/2007,,,5,5,3,2,,3,4,4,4,"Nothing but problems with all of the new electronics. Nav works when it wants to and always when it is at the dealer. Air bags misfunction... messages pop up dealer tells me to just ignore it. Rear camera works MOST of the time. Entertainment system not working for 5 months. Dealer wants to fix it but doesn't have a clue. I guess service personel will eventually be trained on the new model. I owned and still have a 2005, I didn't test drive before purchasing... what a mistake!",Looks great inside and out.,Return to the quality of the previous model.
5,"6 months 10,000 miles and still love it!",Larry ,11/21/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Bought my MDX in June '07 after testing all comparable w/3rd row seats (X5, Q7, GX 470). For the value, it won hands down. For the same items and options in others would have cost an additional 10-20K.  Have 10K miles of city/highway driving, and love every minute of driving it! It's more like a sport sedan than SUV. Ride and acceleration are excellent; seating comfort great in front & back seats. Yes, 3rd row is for kids and small adults, but if you want a full-time 3rd row, get a full-size SUV. They work great when heading out with a few extra friends. No question this is a great combination of value, fun, and luxury in SUV skin. Wife has TL-S - loves driving the X!","Acceleration, sound system, SH-AWD pulls well in all conditions, overall comfort, interior lighting of all controls at night, nav, rear wiper turns on when front wipers are on and vehicle placed in reverse.","Improve the brightness or shield the sun somehow from the radio info screen and nav screen. Very hard to read in bright sunlight. Change nav programming to include the accouncement of the road/street name it's telling you to turn onto. Portables like Garmin can do it, why not Acura?"
5,The vehicle that has it all,un ,11/17/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Very powerful for its size and drives like a car with the SH-AWD making it feel like one, on the most demanding curves. Brakes are stellar with the brake assist feature and with the stability assist control thrown in, your driving is completely technology assisted. We currently get about 18/23 city/hwy on premium gas. Interior is quite comfortable except for the third row which is best for kids under 4'. Navigation/sound system/backup camera/heated seats and dvd make it a nice long trip vehicle. The center console is a huge bin without any coin holders/small compartments. Road noise is prevalant at times. Tire noise is minimal. Lots of techno gizmos to keep you busy for a while.","SH-AWD handling, Customizable settings for two drivers, audio system, steering wheel controls, navigation system and the dvd entertainment system and the widest sunroof in its class.","Headrests need to tilt, sideview mirrors need to be autodimming, sliding second row seats, reconfigure center console storage bin, reduce gaps between moldings making the fit and finish look more tighter and slick."
4.75,Very happy with purchase,Dave R ,11/03/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"I love the comfortable ride and performance. The 10 way power driver's seat combined with the telescoping steering wheel makes it easy to find a comfortable position.  My wife and I both drive the vehicle so the custom seat, mirror, radio, and phone book settings linked to each key are great. The exterior styling is a real head turner, much better than the 2006 models. Visibility from the cockpit at night is great.  Love the interior styling and dash appearance. Third row seating comes in handy on occasion. The navigation system is easy to use and convenient. Practically every feature comes standard. Back-up camera is a nice plus. ","Navigation system, 300 hp engine, lots of features come standard, comfort, exterior and interior styling, headlight design provides exceptional visibility at night, blue tooth capability.",Auto dimming mirrors and auto opening hatch back would be nice. Rear view camera takes a while to kick in after starting up. Servicing is very expensive. I feel obligated to bring it to the dealer to make sure the onboard computer gets updated and continues to provide accurate maintenance reminders.

This vehicle is a big step up from the '02 model: more power, better handling (doesn't feel a bit like a mini-van anymore), more creature comforts and roughly the same fuel economy. Driver's seat is very comfortable for my 5'-11"" frame.  The SH-AWD system is terrific as you feel it pull you around sharp turns as you accelerate. Nav. syst. has good display and gives clear and adjustable directions (from almost constant advice to concise directions). Hands Free Link hooks up to B/tooth c-phone on startup, sound system automatically switches to phone when called.","SH-AWD is great. The engine is very responsive if a bit rough at hi-rpm. The manual shifter is great for rapid acceleration, engine breaking downhill, and holding the proper gear on uphill grades (a 6 speed would be better). The 3-zone climate control great for warm driver with a cold passenger.","HFLink: only Sony-Ericsson c-phones are fully compatible,the voice recog. is poor.

4.875,11 month review,Scott McCandless ,10/24/2007,,,5,4,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I came out of an Expedition to buy this SUV and was pleasantly surprised by how much more comfortable the vehicle is than a truck based SUV.  The horsepower and performance are up from my previous truck/SUV vehicles, and so is the mileage.  Those giving the MDX poor grades for mileage are not comparing it to other SUV choices.  I regularly get 22-23 mpg at 70-75 mph on the highway. I chose this SUV for a couple specific reasons: I needed a vehicle that could tow my 23' boat and its trailer, but I wanted a comfortable, economical everyday ride, too.  The BMW and Lexus didn't have the tow power, or enough room. The truck based SUV choices didn't have ride & economy.","Sporty, but comfortable ride and handling.  Comfortable seats.","It would be nice if the GPS was touch screen rather than iDrive. My portable Garmin is much better for much less money.  The rear view camera picture is very dark and hard to see, and gives a very distorted fish eye view."
4.875,Excellent choice,JC ,10/18/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I love this car! It feels secure & solid; the handling is smooth & the acceleration is strong. The leather seats are comfortable & the sound system is fantastic; great sound quality & easy to use. The nav system has proven to be a real asset. The rearview camera takes a couple of seconds to come on, but gives a good view of whats directly behind the car. The climate control system has been flawless. The power tailgate opens slowly, but works great. I haven't used the bluetooth. The headlights work great too, giving a wide area of coverage. Don't know about other drivers, but I love them! Blind spot on the right rear side, but comfortable w/it now. MPG is decent; 20/22 combined driving. ","The sport mode, sound system, navigation and power tailgate are my favs, but the other toys are really cool too.

4,Great family SUV can be improved,Baymate Diego ,10/12/2007,,,4,4,4,4,,5,4,2,5,We bought a 2007 Acura MDX tech package more than a month ago. Great handling. Overall excellent interior and exterior. Both navigation and backup camera are great additions. Vehicle is wilder than comparable vehicles so think about parking in crowded garages before purchase. We bought this over competitions because of excellent value and the 7 seat capacity. Third row seats practical only for kids. There is sometimes wind noise coming from the right side when driving on freeway. Have not figured that one out yet.,"Exterior, interior design, acceleration/handling, nav. system and backup camera",Make the 2nd row seats movable to create more legroom for 3rd row when needed.

5,Road Tripper ,Ryan ,10/06/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"We bought our MDX in May 2007 and immediately took it on a 4 month, 12,500+ mile road trip through the USA and Canada. Mountains, deserts, bad roads and good - we really put this car through its paces and have been very satisfied. The MDX drives like a car on twisty roads even without the sport suspension and the manumatic was very useful in the mountains. Interior space is excellent - we traveled with a baby & all associated gear. The nav system is accurate and easy to use. Highway gas mileage is better than rated (about 25 mpg), but city is worse (about 17). Only mechanical prob is a ""clicking"" noise when steering at low speed - dealer says they have a fix - have to see.","Handling, mid-rpm acceleration, ride quality, nav system, hands-free phone (should be required by law!), multi-zone AC, 2nd row room, stereo.","AC vents for 3rd row, all 1-touch window controls (not just driver), more low-end torque, rain sensing wipers, better voice recognition."

I really like the feature when you unlock it but forget something and have to go back. You can program it to lock in 30, 60 or 90 seconds after you may have inadvertently unlocked it and forgot. Great security feature. I have taken it on a few long trips and am also very happy with the cruise control especially on steep hill climbs like I have in BC,Canada. I have set it at 80 MPH and climbed a 12%-18% hill grade and maintained it for the 2km hill climb. Awesome!! I actually like the navi control knob that some people seem to hate.   ","Navigation, XM radio, SH-AWD, tri-zone climate control, rear heated seats, oil life gauge, Acura owner link website, for about $20000 less you are getting a excellent SUV compared to the BMW X5.

3,Vibrates Like Crazy,Lewis Lake ,09/24/2007,,,4,3,3,1,,4,4,3,2,"This vehicle vibrates badly at speeds above 60 MPH and has noise issues with rear windows down. Although the performance is great, it corners well, and acts like a big 4X4, it's no fun when the vibration pushes you off the highway. The dealer has not been able to fix the problem and Acura said they have company cars the act the same way. ""Live with it!""",The car is a fast all weather vehicle.,"Find out what is causing this unsafe vibration and fix it. It's not the tires, or the wheels, so quit pointing the finger.

4.25,Great experience so far,Seattle MDX Driver ,09/17/2007,,,4,4,5,5,,4,3,4,5,"Four months and counting in this new SUV We wanted a fun to drive, dependable SUV cut out for city and commuter driving with two kids in the back seat and with the ability to handle snow when needed.  I think we got it.  Only a couple of downsides so far. The front seat makes my legs ache on long drives - in fairness I'm tall but not that tall.  Adjusting the seat to unusal configs helps when the legs start to hurt.   And the rear view camera has been useless to us so far, very hard to see in most daylight situations, at least for us.  I wish I had the rear sensors instead.    ","Navigation is great and handling in Sport Mode is very fun, especially for a guy who just traded in a german sedan to gain the room of the SUV for the kids.  SH AWD hold a lot of promise for this winter.  ","Improve backup camera or get rid of it. Use sensors instead. Six speeds would be nice, too.  "

The technology is like a science fiction movie, at least for someone like me who has never owned a luxury car before. Everything is easy to use if you take the time to read the manual and practice. There are so many minor details that Acura does right to make this car so much more than just a car. I do have some complaints, though, and they mostly relate to practicality: 3rd row legroom could be better based on experience in similar size cars; 2nd row seat buckles are poorly spaced for booster seats; 2nd row climate control vents do not adequately reach the 3rd row.","Navigation system, voice commands, LCD display size, back-up camera, luxurious cockpit.",2nd row seats should be adjustable forward to allow for increased 3rd row legroom when desired.

4.875,What a powerful beauty,try2follow ,09/09/2007,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"I was driving a 2005 MDX and was offered a company car. The choice included BMW X5, Mercedes ML350, Audi Q7 and Lexus RX 350. Given my excellent experience with Acura for the last 2 years I opted for the new MDX. Acura did a great job (interior and exterior).  I love the new sporty look. The seats are very comfortable and provide good support. The 300 hp engine does a great job, sound and performance are impressive. I prefer the new navigation system over the old one. The 10-speaker sound system beats my stereo at home! My children love the larger DVD screen (9 inch now). The blind spots are a problem but once you know you are just extra careful when changing lanes.","Super handling AWD (no commercial joke it really is ""super""), front seats, sequential sport shift, arrangement of center console, power tailgate, top quality interior layout, live traffic update built into navigation system.",Disappointed that Acura did not manage to improve gas mileage versus old model. No hybrid alternative available. Even fully loaded you have to pay extra for the day/night rearview mirror. Blind spots are an issue. Since the new MDX is larger you would expect power folding side mirrors.

I wanted navigation, 3rd row for the kids, midsize luxury SUV. The style is great, so fun to drive and it is the perfect size for my family (3 kids). When I say fun to drive, I really mean I love to drive this car. To soccer games/practices, choir practices, school and preschool drop and pick up. It makes the necessary work and family driving less painful and that is exactly what I was looking for in this car.

I was reluctant to let it go, because it was a great car.  When I first drove the new '07 model it seemed too big and I didn't like the grille.  I am so happy with that I let that go  The ride is fantastic, it's easy to park around the city, the back up camera, bluetooth, and navigation are fantastic.  The power lift gate is a great convenience.  The driver seat is so comfortable.  My kids are in heaven with the rear entertainment system, and I can still listen to my sounds up front.  How great is that?","Bluetooth, voice-activated navigation, radio, and heat.  Power lift gate, driver's seat comfort, rear seat entertainment system w/separate sound system for radio, too.

Back up lights are almost useless. The seats become very uncomfortable if you are slender. A seam cuts across your rear, otherwise they would be great. Our 2001 Lexus nav system was better that the one they pack in the MDX. The auto window lock-out locks the driver out as well as the passengers. Our dog continually lowers the windows with his paws, and turns on the heated seats both front and rear. The tail gate is slick, but the rear hatch opening is too small to fit furniture that, otherwise, should fit. The key fob is not intuitive. Take a long look before you buy.",The vehicle is very reliable with a compellingly beautiful interior. The auto-stick is nice while driving in the mountains. ,Update the navigation system (I really feel ripped off by the one they offer for $2000). Speed up the rear view camera upload.

Most uncomfortable headrest in the industry. Acura claims that it is a safety feature, but it only works if you angle the seat back about 15 degrees!!! Mileage is okay for a heavy SUV.

The audio system quality and navi. are noticeably superior to the bmw's.  Easy to drive around family and friends in comfort.  Easy to haul luggage and purchases from the local hardware store.

Dashboard angled steeply away from driver so in sunlight you cannot see the digital readouts. The 4 dash A/C vents almost close when you aim them to blow air at you.  And under powered - if you think the 300hp stat means this car will outperform a 265hp V8, a test drive will show this car powers more like a 210 hp V6 costing $15K less.  On the plus side, solid luxurious quiet ride and decent handling.  Perfect for soccer moms.
